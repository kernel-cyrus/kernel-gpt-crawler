           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 3, 2022</br>
           </div>
Opinions differ on the best way to disclose security vulnerabilities, but
there is a general consensus in our community  that vulnerabilities
should, indeed, be 
made public at some point.  What happens between the discovery of a
vulnerability and its disclosure can be more controversial.  A recent
discussion on the handling of kernel vulnerabilities has led to change in
the policies of the linux-distros mailing list — all based on the question
of what constitutes "disclosure".
<p>
There are two mailing lists that are commonly used for the discussion of
vulnerabilities in the Linux community; they are not limited to kernel
problems.  The first of these, <a
href="https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">linux-distros</a>,
is a closed list that is used to coordinate the response to non-public
security bugs.  The second, <a
href="https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security">oss-security</a>,
is a public list which is used for, among other things, the public
disclosure of vulnerabilities.  Both are administered by Alexander "Solar
Designer" Peslyak.
<p>
There is a long list of policies that apply to postings on linux-distros,
including one that requires the public disclosure of all vulnerabilities
reported there within a relatively short period of time.  That rule is there to
ensure that companies don't sit on vulnerability reports indefinitely, no
matter how embarrassing they are.  Another list policy, though, says that
vulnerabilities that are <i>already</i> public have no place on
linux-distros; all discussion 
of public vulnerabilities belongs on oss-security instead.  The
implementation of these policies has often proved to be tricky, especially
when dealing with kernel vulnerabilities; see <a
href="/Articles/874069/">this 2021 article</a> for a recent example.
<p>
In mid-May, Peslyak <a
href="/ml/oss-security/20220515162740.GA20526@openwall.com/">wrote to
oss-security</a> in search of a solution for the ongoing mismatch between
the list policies and how the kernel project does business.  The core
problem is how security problems are often handled in the kernel community:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	For Linux kernel maintainers, it is customary to post a fix
	technically publicly but without indication of its security
	relevance, then work on getting it merged into the various trees,
	and expect that its security relevance wouldn't be clearly
	indicated publicly for a while.
</blockquote>
<p>
Such patches <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/690b2549b195">tend to
look like this</a> (though the exploitability of that particular bug has
not been verified here).
According to the linux-distros list policy, this public posting of a fix
makes a particular vulnerability ineligible for discussion there — the
vulnerability has already been disclosed.  But
distributors of the Linux kernel still often want a way to discuss the real
problem, which has not been disclosed yet, under embargo and coordinate the
shipping of the fix to their 
users.  That cannot be done on oss-security, which is public, and it cannot
be done on linux-distros because posting a patch is seen as having
disclosed the vulnerability.
<p>
Increasingly, Peslyak said, the linux-distros policy is simply being
ignored when it comes to kernel vulnerabilities; he asked what should be
done about that problem.  One option, he said, would be to continue to look
the other way when a vulnerability for which a public patch is available
shows up on linux-distros.  Alternatives would include strictly enforcing
the policy (and thus forcing kernel vulnerabilities off the list entirely),
changing the list policy, or even just shutting down the list entirely.
<p>
As one might expect, a variety of opinions was expressed — though nobody
seemed to be in favor of just killing the list.  Jason Donenfeld <a
href="/ml/oss-security/YoJNtNJXUwLySmmO@zx2c4.com/">suggested</a> enforcing
the policy, since kernel developers have little interest in anything but
fixing the bug anyway.  The dominant view, though, seemed to be in favor of
adjusting the list's policies to better fit how the kernel project
operates.  As Donenfeld put it, kernel developers have little interest in
the "security game" and are unlikely to start playing it, but Greg
Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/oss-security/YoOMdbwp3D8bynKy@kroah.com/">described another
reason</a> for why the kernel project handles security fixes the way it
does:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	As you know, there are different "grades" of attackers.  There's a
	huge range from "run metasploit that I just downloaded" to "look at
	this kernel change and figure out how to abuse the system that does
	not have it".  By delaying a small bit of time from publicly
	posting a patch to telling the world that "hey, that was a security
	fix over there" that allows the community that works in the public
	added time for review and testing as our testing infrastructure
	that is NOT public is quite limited and reviews are limited given
	the huge range of needed developers to do that review.
<p>
	That delay can allow users to have the fix on their system first
	before the "metasploit" package is updated to attack it, which
	reduces the amount of vulnerable systems out there.  Yes, it does
	not solve the "prevent readers of all commits" issue, but I don't
	know what we can really do about that except switch to a closed
	source development model, which isn't a good thing overall anyway.
</blockquote>
<p>
The review issue is not a small one.  Security fixes are not immune from
the ills that plague software development in general; they can easily
introduce bugs (including security-related bugs) of their own, cause
user-space regressions, and more.  Like all other changes, they benefit
from more review (and extensive testing) before being applied.  There are
limits to how much of 
that review and testing can happen without posting the patch in public.
<p>
The benefits of obscuring the security problem motivating a specific patch
may not be quite so clear.  It may well reduce the number of casual attacks
from the people often known as "script kiddies" but, as Kroah-Hartman
pointed out, it does little to defend against capable attackers who are
reading the commit stream for the purpose of finding vulnerabilities.  Even
so, 
it seems clear that there are developers and companies that see good
reasons to keep security problems under wraps, at least for a short period.
<p>
Given the perceived value of posting patches without explicitly disclosing
the underlying security issue, Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/oss-security/YoKiGWAX4E%2FmbGWB@kroah.com/">said</a>, the best
thing to do would be to amend the list policy to allow such posts.  He
suggested that other large projects might also benefit from such a policy.
Peslyak <a
href="/ml/oss-security/20220522194644.GB21330@openwall.com/">wasn't
convinced</a> that those projects, most of which do not use linux-distros
at all, would be interested, but he did, in the end, <a
href="/ml/oss-security/20220524125804.GA29146@openwall.com/">decide to
amend the linux-distros policy</a> to accommodate the kernel's way of doing
things.  Issues with a public fix are themselves considered public, the
policy reads, except when they aren't:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	 There can be occasional exceptions to this, such as if the
	 publicly accessible fix doesn't look like it's for a security
	 issue and not revealing this publicly right away is somehow deemed
	 desirable.  In particular, we grant such exceptions to Linux
	 kernel issues concurrently or very recently handled by the Linux
	 kernel security team.
</blockquote>
<p>
Given the lack of subsequent discussion, it seems likely that this change
is acceptable to the list members as a whole.  Meanwhile, Vegard Nossum is
working on <a
href="/ml/linux-doc/20220531230309.9290-1-vegard.nossum%40oracle.com/">some
changes to the kernel's documentation</a> to make the policies for the
reporting of security bugs more clear.  None of this will definitively end
the discussions around vulnerability reporting, disclosure, and
mailing-list policies but, with luck, it will make things work a bit more
smoothly than they do now.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I&#x27;ve been on the kernel security team for a decade.  I can&#x27;t speak for everyone but I would like us work with distributions more closely.  Instead of &quot;occasional exception&quot; cases where security information is communicated to distributions, I wish it were the norm.<br>
<p>
Solar proposes that we use the oss-security page but that&#x27;s really only appropriate for distributions to post security bulletins there.  The security team is never going to post there.  It&#x27;s basically against the rules of s@k.o and it&#x27;s against the rules of my employer and it&#x27;s not something I would do anyway.<br>
<p>
Jason Donenfeld kind of proposed something like a list which was private but the archives would be published after a month?  I would welcome a list like that.<br>

[note that I&#x27;m also on the security list]<br>
<p>
I used to think a list whose archives become public after some time would be a solution, but after so much time spent dealing with bug reports I changed my mind. The reason is the material that are provided by reporters. When they&#x27;re security researchers we don&#x27;t care, they do it for the purpose that it becomes public and sometimes even makes them famous. But for normal bugs reported from the field, that would seriously limit the material shared by the reporters. We could get a network trace, a binary program that triggers the bug and that we&#x27;re not allowed to share, or a copy-paste of a part of a function from an internal program that&#x27;s not opensource. And for many companies there is a big difference between sharing some material with a small trusted team (as they do with a vendor support team) and sharing their material with the whole world.<br>
<p>
And here the problem that is experienced by the kernel security list precisely is: how to contact vendors to share enough info with them to permit them to test their code and backports without sharing with the world some material we&#x27;re not allowed to publish. oss-sec is too open, linux-distros is too strict. In fact linux-distros cannot serve to share info but to coordinate disclosure.<br>
<p>
If we would see these lists as network protocols, oss-sec is broadcast over a datagram protocol and linux-distros is session-oriented and unicast. We don&#x27;t have the unicast datagram protocol we need to notify vendors.<br>

I also thought about if we could add vendors to s@k.o but that doesn&#x27;t work.  The job of figuring out severity and dealing with releases is totally different from just fixing the code.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile this discussion is all driven by s@k.o and not by the distros.  It&#x27;s Greg telling people to ignore the linux-distro rules to get the information out there.  Maybe the distributions are happy with the status quo?  Perhaps something to discuss at Linux Plumbers.<br>

There&#x27;s currently an ongoing discussion started by Vegard on LKML on this subject. I think that the situation is far from being bad, it&#x27;s just that we&#x27;re getting used to the repetition of annoyances, which tends to emphasize the problems. However we must absolutely improve the process because right now it is extremely confusing for reporters, and being directed to linux-distros is stressful to them once they&#x27;re told that the time counter is engaged and they must do a lot of stuff. It needs to be smoother for them, including the first approach which should be to avoid using closed lists for non-important stuff.<br>
<p>
It&#x27;s visible from the reports that most reporters at least hover on the doc, so once an optimal and smooth approach is figured, I think it will result in less surprises for reporters and less friction for everyone.<br>

One might hope someone would have already suggested that the linux-distros mailing list begin to regard &quot;already disclosed&quot; as within the mailing list only, so that definite disclosure would not be preëmpted by reference to an off-list changeset specifically engineered to both not look like disclosure and also misdirect its reader with regard to the vulnerability&#x27;s character and severity. From an outsider&#x27;s perspective the mailing list&#x27;s not already being set up in this way smells like a backroom deal somewhere, it being quite difficult to see the public[0] advantage in keeping something under the radar thru some technicality of a mailing list rule. That the proposed fix appears to be some kind of a case-by-case exceptions process sounds just like more of the same.<br>
<p>
None of this inspires confidence in finding out that something security-critical in the kernel was F-worded, even after it&#x27;s been fixed, even by following all possible sources indicated by the kernel process.<br>
<p>
[0] and one might further expect that, if the options programs of various mega-wealthy C-levels in ultra-rich multinational private corporations were at stake in the previous decade, that they would have been redesigned to no longer have this effect upon the security, therefore reliability, of well near every electronic knick-knack and industrial control system with a MMU in it. (Imagine some humorously egregious emphasis here to further bash the footnote home.)<br>

<a href="/Articles/604609/">Control groups</a>
</div>
<p>I must confess that when I look under the hood of an automobile I can
only just figure out which of the major components are which, and
certainly wouldn't want to try changing the oil.  Looking inside a
sophisticated piece of software is quite a different story: even the
smallest elements jump and dance around together like a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hMjxnwig0o">scene</a> from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_%281940_film%29">Disney's <i>Fantasia</i></a>.  So, no tour of something as rich a Linux control
groups could be complete without exploring the code to see what
patterns we can find.</p>

<p>We have had a few little glimpses into several of the cgroup subsystems
already, so this excursion is going to focus on the cgroups core and,
particularly, on the interconnections between processes and cgroups.
  One question we want to keep in mind is the comparative costs of different
  approaches.  <a href="/Articles/606699/">Last time</a>, we saw a concern
  that trying to use a single 
  hierarchy and still allow independent classification against multiple
  resources could lead to a combinatorial explosion of groups.  If there are
  Q administrative groups, such as login sessions, and in each we potentially
  want to classify processes M different ways against each of N different
  resources, then we might need Q&nbsp;x&nbsp;M&nbsp;x&nbsp;N different groups.  If we allow a
  separate hierarchy for each resource, there would only be
  Q&nbsp;+&nbsp;M&nbsp;x&nbsp;N groups. 
  So the question is: does the simplicity of a single hierarchy outweigh the
  cost of the larger number of cgroups?

</p>

<p>Managing the hierarchies themselves is unlikely to be particularly
interesting — basic tree data structures are taught in most computer
science courses and the shape of a cgroup hierarchy is unlikely to
differ greatly from such structures.  The interesting question is how
processes are connected to cgroups.  As we found when exploring the
various cgroup subsystems, it is sometimes necessary to map from a
process to the cgroup that is relevant for a particular subsystem, and
it is sometimes necessary to get the list of all
processes that are in a cgroup.  It is the data structures which
enable those mappings that will be our main focus.</p>

<p>However, a clarification is in order.  Cgroups are not actually
groups of processes, despite the fact that we have repeatedly
described them that way.  They are in fact groups of threads.  So we
will start out by clarifying the distinction by looking at how
threads and processes are connected to each other and to some
related objects.</p>

<h4>Joining the dots ... er ... processes ... er ... threads</h4>

<p>In V6 Unix, on through the early BSDs and several years of Linux,
the process was a central, well-defined object.  A process had a single
thread of execution, an address space for memory, a process ID number,
and a set of signal handlers, among other details.  There was nothing
else like a process and no room for confusion.</p>

<p>In V6 Unix (released in 1975), these processes where represented by a
pre-allocated array 
of <code>struct&nbsp;proc</code> that was indexed by PID.  If there was
ever a need 
to find a process by some other key, such as by controlling tty, the
code would simply search the whole array.  This was clearly a simpler,
less complicated age.  By the time of 4.3BSD (1986), this fixed array had
become a more dynamic linked list and in 4.4BSD there were even
secondary lists so the processes in a process group could be found
without searching the whole process table.  Since then, things have
only become more complex, though there is still some room for simple
elegance.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/cgroups-procs.png" width=410 height=580
alt="[process diagram]" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3 align="right">

In Linux, the three-level hierarchy we first saw in 4.4BSD
(session, process group, and process) has gained an extra level below
processes: the thread.  The result is a hierarchy something like that
pictured to the right.  A thread has its own execution context and its
own "thread ID" number but can share most other details, particularly
an address space, a set of signal handlers, and a process ID number,
with other threads in the same process.</p>

<p>Internally, a thread is represented by a <code>struct&nbsp;task_struct</code> and is
sometimes referred to as a task.  Unfortunately, processes are also
sometimes referred to as tasks — there is a <code>do_each_pid_thread()</code>
macro that, quite reasonably, iterates over threads.  The matching
macro for iterating over processes is <code>do_each_pid_task()</code>
(both macros are <a
href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/pid.h#L174">defined
in <tt>pid.h</tt></a>).  The term
"process" is somewhat more reliable, but, since the term PID (or
"process ID") is sometimes used for threads, processes, process groups,
and sessions, it is sometimes safer to stick with the more precise
term "thread group".</p>

<p>It would be particularly elegant if all four of these objects, the
session, process group, process, and thread, were managed in a uniform
way.  While that is nearly the case, threads are still handled a bit
specially.  While it may not justify all of the handling
differences, there are two properties of threads that do make them
truly different.  First, there is always one distinguished thread
within a process that is known as the "<code>group_leader</code>".  This
provides something clear to point to and say "this is the <em>process</em>".
The thread ID of the <code>group_leader</code> is the process ID of the whole
process.  A session does have a <code>leader</code> process, though only in a
weak sense, as this process can exit before the rest of the session;
process groups don't have any sort of leader at all.  Secondly, a
thread can only leave a process by exiting — it is not possible for a
thread to move to a different process, unlike process groups where a
process can move from one process group to another.  This has
important implications for locking.</p>

<p>Since Linux gained the concept of "<a href="/Articles/531419/">PID namespaces</a>", where the same
process can have a different PID in different namespaces,
there has been a "<code>struct&nbsp;pid</code>" (pictured blue) that links
the first three object 
types together.  For this discussion the important member of
<code>struct&nbsp;pid</code> is</p>
<pre>
    struct hlist_head tasks[PIDTYPE_MAX];
</pre>

<p>where <code>PIDTYPE_MAX</code> is defined in:</p>


<pre>
    enum pid_type { PIDTYPE_PID, PIDTYPE_PGID, PIDTYPE_SID, PIDTYPE_MAX };
</pre>

<p>(and so is clearly a number of <tt>PIDTYPE</tt>s, not the MAXimum) along with
the corresponding field (shown in yellow):</p>

<pre>
    struct pid_link
    {
	struct hlist_node node;
	struct pid *pid;
    } pids[PIDTYPE_MAX];
</pre>

<p>in <code>struct&nbsp;task_struct</code> (note that some license has been
taken in 
reformatting 
this code for publication).</p>

<p>Each PID has three lists (the <code>hlist_head</code>) of <code>task_struct</code>s, which
are linked together through the three <code>hlist_node</code>s in each
<code>task_struct</code>.  The session and process group lists (<code>PIDTYPE_SID</code> and
<code>PIDTYPE_PGID</code>) are really lists of processes and only the thread
group leaders appear in these lists.</p>

<p>The <code>PIDTYPE_PID</code> list is not, as one might hope, a list of all the
threads in a thread group, but is a list of just the thread (if it
still exists) with this PID as its thread ID.  It seems strange to
use a list to contain just a single entry, but there is a reason.
When one thread in a process makes an <code>exec()</code> system call (in any
of its flavors), all other threads in the process are killed (<tt>SIGKILL</tt>)
and the thread performing <code>exec()</code> takes over the identity (particularly the PID) of the thread group leader.  This can result in
two different threads having the same thread ID for a short time.
Having a list for <code>PIDTYPE_PID</code> makes this possible.</p>

<p>The list of threads in a process is managed quite separately,
using the field:</p>

<pre>
    struct list_head thread_group;
</pre>


<p>The first three lists had a distinct "head", in the <code>struct&nbsp;pid</code>, and
then a number of "nodes", one in each <code>struct&nbsp;task_struct</code>.  This list
of threads forms a loop (drawn in red) with no head or tail.  This is
problematic for 
a subtle, but important, reason that, perhaps surprisingly, would not
be a problem for the other three lists.</p>

<p>Because threads are only removed from a thread group (aka process)
when they are being destroyed, it is safe to walk the list without
strong locking.  The lightweight "RCU read lock" is sufficient.  When
a thread is removed from the list, it remains half-in for just long
enough that any code in the middle of walking the list and
currently looking at the thread being deleted can still continue on
to reach the end — though, given that the list is a loop, we should
really say that it reaches the point in the loop where it started.</p>

<p>A potential problem with this picture is that if some code iterates
over the thread list and starts from a thread which exits before the
iteration finishes, it will never find its starting point and could
loop forever.  It is always safe to start from thread group leader (as
it is remains a "zombie" until all other threads exit), but there is
nothing in the API to force that starting point.  One example of such questionable
usage is in <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/taskstats.c?v=3.15#L218"><tt>fill_stats_for_tgid()</tt></a> which accumulates some statistics
across all threads in a list.  If this was requested for a PID that
was not a thread group leader (which would be odd, but quite possible),
it could hit problems if the thread exited at the wrong time.
According to <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0c740d0afc3bff0a097ad03a1c8df92757516f5c">Oleg Nesterov</a> (writing during Linux 3.14 development),
"<q>almost every lockless usage [of this thread linkage] is wrong</q>".</p>

<p>Consequently, in Linux 3.14, a new linkage (not pictured) was introduced
that has a distinct <code>thread_head</code>, which is stored in the
<code>signal_struct</code>, that
contains a number of fields that are specific to a process (as opposed
to a thread).  I find it a little disappointing that this <code>head</code>
doesn't appear in <code>struct&nbsp;pid</code> like the other list heads, but that
probably wouldn't have much practical benefit.  In due course, all
users should move away from the <code>thread_group</code> linkage, which can then
be discarded.</p>

<p>This issue reminds us that locking is both subtle and important, so it
must be understood properly.  For all the lists we have looked at
here, as well as the children/sibling list that links children of a
process together, and the init_task/tasks list that links all
processes together, there is a reader/writer spinlock, helpfully called
<code>tasklist_lock</code>, that protects all accesses and changes.  The
only list 
accesses that are permitted without that lock are to follow the threads
in a process (preferably using the new <code>thread_head</code> list) and to
iterate over all task group leaders starting from <code>init_task</code>.  These
are safe with only the RCU read lock as threads are never moved out of
these lists into another.</p>

<p>There is some suggestion that this <code>tasklist_lock</code> has problems.  One
of the problems is that multiple overlapping readers can starve a
process which needs to get write access.  From <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1453808">Oleg Nesterov again</a>
(in a reply to <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1453180">this
patchset</a>): "<q>Everyone seem to agree that tasklist[_lock] should die</q>".</p>


<p>It would be an interesting exercise to make all the lists of processes
and threads RCU-safe.  This certainly wouldn't be trivial and, despite being
<a ref="/Articles/364583/">proposed</a> by Thomas Gleixner over four years
ago, it still hasn't happened. 
However given that the VFS's directory entry (dentry) cache <a
href="/Articles/419811/">can often be 
accessed under RCU</a>, it seems likely that something can be done for the
process tree too.
</p>

<h4>Cgroups linkages</h4>

<p>These various linkages between threads and processes are made even
more interesting by cgroups.  The linkage to form cgroups into a
hierarchy is fairly unsurprising (it is being rearranged
substantially for 3.16, but the principle is unchanged):</p>
<pre>
    struct list_head sibling;   /* my parent's children */
    struct list_head children;  /* my children */
    struct cgroup *parent;      /* my parent */
</pre>

<p>Much more interesting is the linkage between threads and cgroups.  As
noted previously, there can be multiple cgroup hierarchies and each
thread belongs to one cgroup in each of them.  This requires an M&nbsp;x&nbsp;N
mapping, so a few lists won't do.  The required mapping is achieved
using two intermediate data structures: the <code>css_set</code> and the
<code>cgrp_cset_link</code>.</p>

<img alt="[Cgroup hierarchy structures]"
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/cgroups-connect.png"  align="right" width=415 height=435
hspace=5> 

<p>When a process forks, the child will be in all the same cgroups that
the parent is in.  While either process could be moved around, they
very often are not.  This means that it is quite common for a
collection of processes (and the threads within them) to all be in the
same set of cgroups.  To make use of this commonality, the <code>struct&nbsp;css_set</code> exists.  It identifies a set of cgroups (<code>css</code> stands for
"cgroup subsystem state") and each thread is attached to precisely one
<code>css_set</code>.  All <code>css_set</code>s are linked together in a hash table so that
when a process or thread is moved to a new cgroup, a pre-existing
<code>css_set</code> can be reused, if one exists with the required set of
cgroups.</p>

<p>With similar threads and processes linked into a <code>css_set</code>, we still have
an M&nbsp;x&nbsp;N mapping problem, it is just that the M is no longer the number
of threads, but is now the much smaller number of <code>css_set</code>s.
To link the various cgroups to the various <code>css_set</code>s we have the
aptly-named <code>cgrp_cset_link</code>:</p>

<pre>
    struct cgrp_cset_link {
	struct cgroup       *cgrp;
	struct css_set      *cset;
	struct list_head    cset_link;
	struct list_head    cgrp_link;
    };
</pre>


<p>For each <code>css_set</code>, there is one <code>cgrp_cset_link</code> for every hierarchy.
Each cgroup has a <code>cset_links</code> field that connects
together all the <code>cgrp_cset_link</code>s for that cgroup and from which all
the threads in that cgroup can be found.  Similarly each <code>css_set</code> has
a <code>cgrp_links</code> field from which all the cgroups
containing any of the threads in that <code>css_set</code> can be found (if all
these <code>list_head</code>s are making your head spin, <a href="http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-11-sect-5">makelinux</a> has a fairly
good introduction to Linux linked lists).</p>

<p>This data structure quite effectively links all the threads and all
the cgroups together.  Whether it does so efficiently is a different
question.  It is quite good for finding all of the cgroups for a
thread, or all the threads for a cgroup.  It is far from suitable for
finding the cgroup that provides, say, the <code>net_cl</code> subsystem for a
particular process (in order to determine the class ID to assign to a
new socket).</p>

<p>To meet this need there is some extra linkage (not shown in the
picture above).  Each <code>css_set</code> contains an array of pointers
indexed by 
subsystem number that provides a direct link to the relevant cgroup
for each subsystem, bypassing the <code>cgrp_css_link</code> structures.</p>
<pre>
    struct cgroup_subsys_state *subsys[CGROUP_SUBSYS_COUNT];
</pre>

<p>(<code>cgroup_subsys_state</code> holds subsystem-specific information tightly
connected to a cgroup).</p>

<p>If we turn now to the locking used to manage these lists, there are a
couple of surprises.  First, while there is a reader/writer lock that
protects all of these linkages like there was with processes and tasks,
this lock — <code>css_set_rwsem</code> — is a semaphore rather than a
spinlock.  This is surprising because semaphores are normally used
when locks can be held for longer, so the waiting process might need to
sleep (rather than just spin).  Examining the history of this lock, it
turns out that it was a spinlock until quite <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=96d365e0b86ee7ec6366c99669687e54c9f145e3">recently</a> and was changed
to a semaphore as part of a process to incrementally tidy up some
code.  It seems likely that this will become a spinlock again.</p>

<p>The other surprise is more interesting: cgroups adds another lock
that can stop threads from joining or leaving a thread group:
<code>group_rwsem</code>.  There is one of these locks for each thread group
(stored in the <code>signal_struct</code>); it is rarely taken exclusively
(i.e. for write), so it is unlikely to affect performance though,
generally, avoiding new locks is best.  It does raise a question,
though: why do we need this new lock to protect the threads list?</p>

<p>The lock is needed because cgroups are groups of threads, rather than
groups of processes.  This means that when a process is added to a
cgroup, each individual thread must be added separately, and it is
necessary to keep the list of threads stable while they are being
removed from one cgroup and added to another.  If cgroups were truly
groups of processes, there would be no need to move threads
individually, and this lock could be discarded.  The value of listing
threads, rather than just process (or group leaders), is not obvious
in the code.  An analysis of the various subsystems from the
perspective of whether any could make use of being able to distinguish
between different threads is left as an exercise for the interested
reader.</p>

<h4>What did we learn?</h4>

<p>Most of the value of looking into data structures is simply fleshing
out a picture of how things plug together so that we can reason about the
consequences of any possible changes.  Nonetheless, there are a few
specific lessons we can take away from this exploration.</p>

<p>First, we had a reminder that terminology can be challenging, and
that we should be careful when interpreting what we read in the kernel
code.  A <code>task</code> is often a task, and a <code>MAX</code> is mostly a maximum.  But
not always.</p>

<p>Secondly, locking can be tricky.  It is generally best to avoid
requiring locks where possible, and doing so is easier when the data
structures are simple
and elegant.  Reducing the impact of <code>tasklist_lock</code> is
probably possible and apparently desirable.  Reducing the impact of
the cgroups locks, should that be necessary, would be harder simply
because the data structures are more complex.</p>

<p>Finally, a key point of that complexity is the proliferation of
multiply-linked <code>cgroup_cset_link</code> structures.  There would be
as many of 
these as there would be of cgroups — if we had a single hierarchy and
created a multitude of cgroups, as discussed last time, to allow different
combinations of different process classifications for different
resources.</p>

<p>Put another way, the combinatorial explosion we were concerned about
is unavoidable.  It may be explicit in a multitude of cgroups, or it
may be implicit in a multitude of <code>cgroup_cset_link</code> structures, but
it will exist.  Currently, cgroups are much bigger structures than the
<code>link</code> structures, and <code>cgroup_cset_link</code>s are created automatically,
rather than requiring <code>mkdir</code> requests, so possibly having a
proliferation of <code>links</code> is cheaper than a proliferation of cgroups.</p>

<p>This does suggest, though, that we could express the concern a
different way.  Rather than being concerned about a proliferation, we
could instead be concerned about the size of cgroups and what
mechanisms could be used to create cgroups automatically.</p>

<p>With that puzzle left as an open question, we come to the end of what
we can discover about cgroups as they are found in Linux 3.15, the
current release of Linux at the time of writing.  We aren't quite
finished yet though.  The next and final installment will look beyond
3.15 to find out what value the proposed unified hierarchy might
bring, and to try to present all the core issues into one coherent
picture.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/systemd/kdbus">kdbus</a> interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism has been somewhat
controversial since well before it was <a href="/Articles/619068/">first
posted</a> to 
the kernel mailing list a little over a year ago.  It is targeted at
bringing the capabilities of the <a
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/">D-Bus message bus</a>
to the kernel for performance, security, and reliability purposes.  But, for
a variety of reasons, it has not been merged into the mainline.  It now
turns out that the whole mechanism is being rethought and redesigned before
another attempt to get it into the kernel will be made.

<p>
A recent discussion on the kernel mailing list didn't really illuminate
much about the future direction of kdbus, but it did, perhaps, highlight some of
the reasons that the project has not had a smooth path into the kernel.
The thread was spawned by the <a href="/Articles/664014/">announcement</a>
on the fedora-devel mailing list
that kdbus would be removed from the Rawhide kernel—where it has been
available for the last six months or so—while the
developers "<q>rethink some of the approach they are taking with
kdbus</q>".  That led some to wonder what kind of rethinking was being
done and how it might change kdbus.
</p>

<p>
Richard Weinberger <a href="/Articles/664049/">started</a> the thread by
noting the Rawhide announcement and wondering about the plans.  That was
greeted with a terse <a href="/Articles/664051/">reply</a> from Greg
Kroah-Hartman—who has been coordinating the kdbus effort—that the changes
would be "<q>posted for review 'when it's ready'</q>".  He seemed to
<a href="/Articles/664054/">bristle a bit</a> at the follow-up request for
more information: 
<div class="BigQuote">
Since when do people post "plans" or "design documents" on lkml without
real code?  Again, code will be posted when it's ready, like any other
kernel submission.
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>
Part of Kroah-Hartman's irritation is likely due to the <a
href="/Articles/649111/">preemptive attempts</a> to head off kdbus back in
June.
No information was posted to the list, but some of the details of the kdbus
rethinking were revealed in Lennart 
Poettering's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4AAjEaTehk">systemd
status report [YouTube]</a> at the inaugural <a
href="https://systemd.events/systemdconf-2015">systemd conference</a> held
in early November.  Around the 24-minute mark, Poettering noted that kdbus
had been "less of a success story" than many of the other systemd components
he had already discussed. 

<p>
He mentioned the removal of kdbus from the Rawhide kernel, but stressed that the
project was not dead.  The developers were simply taking a step back and
"figuring out how we want to do this stuff".  The existing kdbus put the
compatibility with "classic D-Bus" into the kernel, but the team is now
looking into doing less D-Bus compatibility in the kernel and moving that to
user space.  He is not sure how it will look in the end and is not willing
to make any predictions about when it will end up in the kernel.  It was
needed in the kernel two years or so ago when the project got started and
that is 
still true today, he said.

<p>
Beyond that, some took exception to Kroah-Hartman's refusal to discuss
plans on the mailing list.  Josh Triplett <a href="/Articles/664065/">quoted</a>
the development-process documentation, which suggests involving the kernel
community early in the process.  But kdbus developer David Herrmann <a
href="/Articles/664071/">thought</a> that was not really applicable in this
case:
<div class="BigQuote">
I think comparing kdbus to "behind closed doors" development models is
unfair. We chose to center our development around DBus, not the
kernel. Anybody who is interested in kdbus discussions could have
easily joined the DBus and systemd communication channels (and *many*
people did). I see little reason in cross-posting everything to LKML,
especially given that our communication is rarely mail-based.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The last line in that quote points out a fundamental mismatch between how
kernel development and systemd/kdbus development are done.  It turns out
that most of the discussion is not going on behind closed doors, but it is
happening on IRC or in person, which makes it hard for outsiders to follow
or monitor.
In his talk, Poettering noted that systemd had moved to GitHub, which has
been quite a boon for the project.  In particular, though the code review
facilities of GitHub are nowhere near perfect, they enabled systemd to do
much more code review than the previous mailing-list-centric workflow.
</p>

<p>
So systemd is using different tools than the kernel is, which makes it hard
for kernel developers to get a view into how kdbus is evolving.  The
expectation of at least some kernel developers is that the patch set would
continue to be updated and posted in full periodically. Those postings
would  show how the
review comments had been incorporated into the code.  But there have only
been patches to kdbus posted since the last posting of the full patch set
back in March.  Peter Zijlstra was <a href="/Articles/664078/">not happy
with that approach</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
I've seen many random kdbus patches, but not a single comprehensive
posting one could attempt to review after that.
<p>
The normal way is to regularly post a complete set of patches for
review -- which very much includes folding patches you get back into the
series, not post a 100+ patch series.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Kroah-Hartman doesn't see anything out of the ordinary with the
development of kdbus.  It
is currently being rethought and will be <a href="/Articles/664081/">posted
for review</a> when that process has completed:
<div class="BigQuote">
And that will happen, when the code is ready, nothing different is
happening here from any other code submission.  I don't know why people
somehow think we don't know how to do this whole thing, it's as if they
don't trust us, which is sad.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Andy Lutomirski, who has been one of the strongest critics of kdbus, was
<a href="/Articles/664087/">unhappy</a> with how his feedback had been
handled.  Lutomirski has extensively reviewed the code and had <a
href="/Articles/641275/">several technical disagreements</a> with the kdbus
approach.  To a large extent, the kdbus developers disagreed with his
criticisms at the time, but it is unclear whether that has changed: "<q>Now the submission has been withdrawn (because of feedback received so
far?  from me?) and there will apparently be a new submission out of
the blue, allegedly based on feedback.</q>".  He called that style of
receiving feedback "off-putting", which made him far less interested in
doing further reviews.
</p>

<p>
While the thread was, at least partly, just a squabble between developers,
it does point to a looming potential problem.  Doing development on a mailing
list is increasingly seen as unworkable for many projects these days.
There are other tools (like GitHub, IRC, or even Google Hangouts) that
provide a different experience that some projects are finding  better
suited to their needs.  But it does tend to make those projects more
insular—it is harder for outsiders to come up to speed at their own pace,
as the pace is set by the realtime nature of some of the tools.
</p>

<p>
In any case, it would seem that we are a ways off from seeing another
version of kdbus.  It does sound like some of the criticisms, especially
those about
putting D-Bus semantics into the kernel, have been acted upon. That may
result in a more generalized IPC mechanism, which is likely to be
well-received.  Those who are most interested 
can join the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/#mailinglists">D-Bus/systemd communication channels</a>, as Herrmann suggested,
to find out
what is being planned, others will just
have to wait and see what gets posted.

I tend to do a lot of my development on IRC too, but since I've been raised on email communication, I like to post periodic RFC patch sets whenever a design change has been made. That way I have something that gets nicely archived and that I can point to for those questioning the code in the future.<br>
<p>
That said, if the development code isn't currently working, then I can understand why they wont post patches. Why post broken patches? It would be nice if the kdbus developers post an RFC patch set to LKML before they do a pull request. When they have something they are happy with, then an RFC set should go out. Then a larger audience can review the code before anything is permanently made.<br>

The claim that doing development on Github makes things more "insular" is a bit weird, no?<br>
<p>
We moved systemd to Github precisely to make it easier for people to contribute, since there are certainly a ton more developers used to the Github ways, than to doing patch management with a mailing list. If anything, we did it to be less "insular", and to ensure that we get a wider range of drive-by patches. To lower the bar for contributions, because people tend to have a Github account anyway and are accustomed to its workflow. OTOH doing ML-based patch review not only usually requires you to sign up to that ML first, but then also is just massively awkward to use.<br>
<p>
I am pretty sure that being on the "continent" that is Github with systemd is a much better choice to encourage contributions than being on our own private "island" with an isolated git, ML and bugzilla.<br>

I think it's more like Brits see the continental Europe "insular" (they drive on the wrong side of the road, measure distances in kilometeres, etc.) - even if they are the ones who are actually on island(s). Bit weird, but depends on point of view. In this analogy the kernel developers are sitting on that island, doing things the same way they've been doing for 20(0) years, while others follow new ways like the SI system or GitHub.<br>

I think that is a very good analogy. Let me extend it further. If someone from Germany were to visit England and they insisted on driving on the right side of the road, the result would be disastrous. Nobody is asking that systemd nor dbus be developed like the kernel. We are only asking that the code that will be modifying the kernel be developed as the rest of the kernel code is done.<br>
<p>
If Greg had simply replied to Richard with "The kdbus team is looking to redesign to have less D-Bus compatibility in the kernel for a more generic solution. We will post patches when we have a working prototype we are happy with" then that would have been a great response, and everyone would be happy. But just a "it is being reworked/redesigned" with no comment to exactly what design they plan on doing, makes the previous reviewers feel rather worthless and unwelcomed.<br>
<p>
BTW, it's great to hear that they are looking at a more generic solution. As I'm sure that it can become a key aspect of IPC among a lot of different applications.<br>

We certainly looked at the world as NAR describes back in the Victorian era, though this has since changed with the passing of Empire and now it's the US whose citizens have the luxury of looking at the world this way. Some vestiges of this survive in e.g. newspaper coverage, where a disaster becomes instantly far more newsworthy if it kills a single Briton and a newsworthy disaster that kills a single Briton gets saturation coverage of the latter and distinctly limited coverage of everything else, because the readers just won't care about those damn continentals, y'know?<br>

Agreed, I don't think using Github is bad and makes development more insular.<br>

The interesting question is, can my question regarding the kdbus refactoring<br>
answered by looking at your Github repo?<br>
I have to admit that I'm by far not a Github power user, can you please point me<br>

Neither am I hacking on kdbus myself (that's David, Daniel, Djalal, ...), nor can I really tell you anything I don't know myself.<br>
<p>
When people sketch out things they tend to do that in their head, on a piece of a paper, over a glass of beer, or even at a meeting with some peers -- before they propose it to the bigger audience. kdbus isn't really any different from other projects there...<br>
<p>
I am surprised that this is news to you, but LKML is certainly not the forum where I'd first sketch out a new design, or would recommend anyone else to do. Unless, of course, you like being abused and like frustration. I personally don't like either, hence I stay far far away from it. But then again, as I am not a kdbus hacker really, it's not really my choice anyway.<br>
<p>
If you are interested to contribute to kdbus or systemd development, then please join our development community, and contribute patches, for example via github. Please come to our conferences and hackfests, or meet us at the various other conferences/hackfests we attend. It's an open community, a very open one. But LKML is certainly not our community's discussion forum.<br>

nobody requests systemd/dbus discussions to happen on LKML, this would be insane.<br>
The complaint is that discussions related to core kernel code, such as kdbus, should happen<br>
on LKML such that kernel guys can comment early.<br>
Or at least questions like mine should be answered on LKML.<br>

Ahem. So, kdbus is not core kernel code and never was. It's more akin to a device driver. It does not touch core kernel code but can easily be built outside of the kernel tree. It exposes a device node and could even be autoloaded on request like any other device driver.<br>
<p>
Also, something tells me your personal interest in kdbus specifically, Richard, is more fuelled by a thirst for gossip and the entertainment value rather then the heartfelt desire to work with the project. I am pretty sure if you really cared about the project you'd hace found ways to contribute, like many others did.<br>

You both are talking about it from angles.  From a kernel viewpoint, kdbus doesn't touch any core kernel code.  From a userspace perspective, kdbus (if it is still going to be called that) will become more critical if and when it becomes a non optional dependency for anything major.  We are not there yet.<br>

The last kdbus submission had deep interactions with the core of the kernel.   The code had significant maintenance implicatoons on several core kernel subsystems.  The fact kdbus could be built as a module only happened because at least one planned feature was not implemented in kdbus.<br>
<p>
The last kdbus submision had deep interactions with at least the mm layer, the vfs layer (rethinking the file descriptor), the af unix socket garbage collection, the way permission checks are handled in the kernel.<br>
<p>
The kbus code was not at all like a driver in a well maintained subsystem that only has to follow the pattern of interacting with the kernel that many other similar drivers before it have established.  Further even a lousy driver is better than nothing as the hardware is ay least somewhat usable.  Kdbus certainly does not match that merge criteria.<br>
<p>
<p>
So from a kernel maintenance perspective kdbus (at least as it was last presented) is core kernel code. <br>
<p>
I mention this so people understand the reason why people have scrutinuzed kdbus closely.  It is not just some appendage to the rest of the kernel that other kernel developers can ignore.   We either deal with the kdbus issues early or later when they bite us.<br>

AFAIR the kdbus effort is largely spearheaded by Greg Kroah-Hartman rather than Lennart Poettering, who IIRC is more of a user-space kind of guy.
</p>
<p>
If I were to suggest that Greg K-H doesn't know or can't tell what is acceptable to add to the Linux kernel I'd probably be treading on thin ice.

Contribute in the form of patching and nothing else, reporters cant even label their own reports so in that sense it's more "insular" and isolated to the self dubbed cabal ( RH employees ).<br>

This is with an account and is limited to the platform and it being centralized and proprietary so comparison with self hosting open solutions like mozilla bugzilla ( which is what gcc is using ) is to me comparing apples and oranges regardless if you have login accounts on both places or not.<br>

is a problem. I'm aware of some projects that did consider GitHub, but refrained from it, because they considered it a proprietary platform. Has this been an issue in the systemd community?<br>

Not if you don't keep backups of your issues, mirror the pulls/ ref namespace, and back up the wiki (if relevant). It's possible to gather all of the data, but it isn't just a "git clone".<br>

To be fair, the wiki is also a git repo (see the "Clone this wiki" box to the right of any wiki page), so it's only data in the pull/issues system and release assets that can't be deterministically regenerated that are a pain to back up.<br>

I was more going for the point that those things aren't normally backed up in the normal course of things (like a git clone is, modulo your "git pull" rate). Keeping backups of all of those things are *possible*, but not usually done automatically. The wiki is in the same boat since it is a separate repository and typically lacks the crowd-source backups the main repo is likely to have.<br>

I'll try to follow along with the new development.  I'm glad to hear that the kdbus folks are considering keeping a lot more of it in userspace.<br>

Doing it over beer in Germany and keeping track on IRC isn't so easy for me, on account of barely having time to do things like tracking IRC channels and not living anywhere near Germany, though.<br>

So maybe a better way to record irc conversations and convert them into an easy to read and index format? <br>

Other than that maybe someone should tell him that everyone wants what he is coding but they do not want to tell him after he has done all the work there is a design flaw.<br>

<div class="ArticleText">
High-performance I/O generally involves the use of direct memory access
(DMA) operations.  With DMA, the I/O device transfers data directly to and
from main memory without the intervention of the CPU.  In the simplest form
of DMA, the controller is handed a pointer to a region of memory, given the
length, and told to do its thing.  The processor can then forget about the
operation until the device signals that the work is done.
<p>

This simple view has a drawback, however, in that it assumes that the data
to be transferred is stored contiguously in memory.  When the I/O buffer is
in kernel space, the kernel can often arrange for it to be physically
contiguous - though that gets harder as the size of the buffers gets
larger.  If the buffer is in user space, it is guaranteed to be scattered
around physical memory.  So it would be nice if DMA operations could work
with buffers which are split into a number of distinct pieces.
<p>

In fact, with any reasonably capable peripheral device, buffers can be
split this way.  The term for operations on such buffers is "scatter/gather
I/O"; scatter/gather has been well supported under Linux for some time.
The DMA chapter of <a href="/Kernel/LDD3/"><i>Linux Device Drivers</i></a>
covers scatter/gather in a fair amount of detail.  In short, a driver
starts by filling in an array of <tt>scatterlist</tt> structures, which (on
the i386 architecture) look like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct scatterlist {
        struct page	*page;
    	unsigned int	offset;
    	dma_addr_t	dma_address;
    	unsigned int	length;
    };
</pre>
<p>
For each segment, the <tt>page</tt> pointer tells where the segment is to be
found in memory, <tt>offset</tt> tells where the data begins within the
page, and <tt>length</tt> is the length of the segment.  Once the list has
been filled in, the driver calls:
<p>
<pre>
    int dma_map_sg(struct device *dev, struct scatterlist *sg, int nents,
                   enum dma_data_direction direction);
</pre>
<p>
This operation, at a minimum, fills in the <tt>dma_address</tt> field of
each scatterlist entry with an address which can be given to the peripheral.  It
might do more, though: physically contiguous pages may be coalesced into a
single <tt>scatterlist</tt> entry, or the system's I/O memory management
unit might be programmed to make parts (or all) of the list virtually
contiguous from the device's point of view.  All of this - including the
exact form of <tt>struct scatterlist</tt> - is architecture dependent, but
the scatter/gather interface is set up so that drivers need not worry about
architecture details.
<p>

Recently, a particular constraint in the scatter/gather interface has
turned up.  For various reasons, scatterlists must fit within a single
page; that restriction puts an upper limit on the number of segments which
may be represented.  On the i386 architecture, with high memory enabled,
<tt>struct scatterlist</tt> requires 20 bytes, which limits a scatterlist
to 204 entries.  If each scatterlist entry points to a full page, the
maximum size for a DMA transfer will be about 800KB.  On an x86-64 system,
the situation is worse: the structure uses 40 bytes, cutting the maximum
length in half.
<p>

There are situations where larger I/O operations are desirable.  The block
I/O subsystem is one of them, but there are certainly others:
high-resolution video capture devices are an example.  The limitation on
scatterlist length is one of the factors motivating developers who are
working on <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/232757/">large block size
support</a>.  By increasing the effective page size, they are able to
increase the maximum I/O operation size.
<p>

Increasing the page size is not the only feasible approach, though; another
is simply to make scatterlists longer.  Multi-page contiguous scatterlists
are not really in the cards, but chaining single-page scatterlists can be
done.  Jens Axboe has been working on that approach; his <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/234605/">scatterlist chaining patch</a> is
on its sixth revision as of this writing.  
<p>

Chaining is done by overloading the <tt>page</tt> pointer in the last
scatterlist entry in a page.  The least significant bit is set to indicate
that the entry is, in fact, a chain link rather than another segment to
transfer.  The change is <i>almost</i> transparent to drivers.  In current
kernels, the code which iterates through a scatterlist usually looks
something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct scatterlist *sg = &amp;the_scatterlist[0];

    for (i = 0; i < nentries; i++) {
	program_io_operation(sg);
	sg++;
    }
</pre>
<p>

When chaining is being used, simply incrementing through the array no
longer works.  So Jens has added a simple <tt>sg_next()</tt> macro to
follow the the chain links when necessary.  So the <tt>sg++</tt> line above
turns into something like:
<p>
<pre>
    sg = sg_next(sg);
</pre>
<p>
Since a driver change is required, chained scatterlists should not be used
unless one knows for sure that the driver is prepared for them.  The patch
from Jens fixes up a number of drivers, especially in the block subsystem.
Even so, the maximum I/O size must be raised explicitly by the
administrator (via a sysfs file) before chaining will be turned on.  Once
it's enabled, however, multi-megabyte I/O operations become possible.  No
intrusive memory management changes required.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I assume you hint at the variable pagecache patch that's floating around, but is this scatterlist chaining a reaction to that, or coincidentally at around the same time?<br>

      <p> I was also interested in that. There doesn't seem to be any direct posting of perf. numbers, but it does hint at it indirectly (from <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/9/251">http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/9/251</a>):</p>

I was wondering, does this mean that the speed of disk I/O (I/O to the raid controller) is
being negatively impacted by this constraint, if we can only transfer a maximum of 800KB per
interrupt. 

This means that either a processor needs to spend more time servicing interrupts, because more
interrupts need to be generated to move the data about, or that less data is going to get
transferred?

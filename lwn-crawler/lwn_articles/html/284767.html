<p>
Embedded Linux is getting a lot of attention these days.  A new kernel.org
mailing list, <a
href="http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-embedded">linux-embedded</a>&mdash;<a
href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.embedded">archived
here</a>&mdash;has been set up, with discussions and patches already being
posted.  In addition, Paul Gortmaker and David Woodhouse have volunteered
to be the "embedded maintainers" for the kernel to help coordinate the embedded
Linux community.  They graciously agreed to a joint email interview to shed
some light on their new roles.
<p>
<b>LWN:</b>  What is your background with Linux, especially with embedded
Linux? 

<div class="BigQuote">
<b>David</b>: I got involved in Linux while I was at University, and ended
up working
at Nortel during one of the summer vacations, on a project for
networking over mains power lines. It involved Linux boxes as routers,
and I was working on solid state storage for that. From that, and from
the basic support we had for similar devices in the PCMCIA code base,
the MTD [Memory Technology Device] subsystem grew.
<p>
After a while, I ended up working for Red Hat's engineering services
division, doing board ports, drivers and other work. That's when JFFS2
was written, as part of a customer contract.
<p>
I've been at Red Hat since 2000, in various r&ocirc;les including spending
most of the last couple of years on OLPC. Due to HR misconduct, I
handed in my notice on Monday and will be going elsewhere. I spoke to my
new boss before volunteering for the 'embedded maintainer' r&ocirc;le, and he
was happy with that&mdash;it's another Linux-friendly company where I'll be
doing kernel development, and community interaction will continue to be
part of my day job.

</div>
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<b>Paul</b>: I started using Linux back in the pre 1.0 days, and having
always been one to
take things apart and see how it works, being able to do that with the OS
appealed to me.  I put together various documents to help people back when
the
entry level into Linux was quite high, started fixing and writing drivers,
and
on it went from there.  In 2005, I joined Wind River, where I've been
primarily
focused on kernel and board specific kernel patches, and this has given me
the
opportunity to be exposed to all the different architectures and lots of
board variants within each architecture family.

</div>


<p>
<b>LWN:</b> What is the role you see for the embedded Linux maintainers for
the kernel?

<div class="BigQuote">
<b>David</b>: A bunch of things really. It's not like a normal maintainer
r&ocirc;le where
we take ownership of a certain section of code; it's a bit more fluid.
<p>
To start with, one of the things we really need to do is work with the
various people who are using Linux in "embedded" situations, and help
them to work better with the community. That isn't just the vendors of
consumer equipment&mdash;it's communities like OpenWRT, handhelds.org, OLPC
too. In no other field is the development of the Linux kernel so
balkanised, with people all over the place carrying their own patches or
even full trees of code.
<p>
Another part of the job, which is actually something I've been doing for
years anyway, is reviewing general changes in the kernel with a
particular mind to how they affect embedded systems. That's not just
bloatwatch, although obviously that's a part of it. It also covers
things like watching the IBM zSeries folks provide execute-in-place
support for block devices under z/VM, and saying "hey, how can we use the
same memory management for XIP from flash?".
<p>
The other main part of it is implementing features in the core kernel
which are motivated by "embedded" requirements. Like the tricks for
compiling parts of the kernel with "<tt>-fwhole-program --combine</tt>" to let
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/197097/">GCC optimise better and reduce code size</a>, for example.
<p>
A certain amount of it, especially the new
linux-embedded@vger.kernel.org list, I expect to be a kind of targeted
kernelnewbies&mdash;but obviously with a more specific focus on embedded
issues, and to a certain extent on professional developers rather than
having such a high proportion of hobbyists. Although I certainly
wouldn't want to discourage the hobbyists and students from getting
involved with embedded. It's a good way to get people to send you cute
toys, after all!
<p>
I was trying to avoid having a 'linux-embedded' git tree, but for small
things like the patch Tim Bird just sent to the linux-embedded list to
introduce CONFIG_CONSOLE_TRANSLATIONS, I suppose it makes sense&mdash;so
I've created that at <a href="http://git.infradead.org/embedded-2.6.git">git://git.infradead.org/embedded-2.6.git</a>.
</div>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<b>Paul</b>: There are several things that can be done here that will all
benefit Linux and
its users in the end.  To start with, I'm hoping that we can close some of
the
entry level gap between people who don't necessarily track kernel
development
but yet have decided to develop on Linux with a specific embedded use case
in
mind, and those people who are long time Linux developers.  We can also
improve
the linkage between people writing feature changes and some of the users of
those features who are likely to be impacted, but otherwise would probably
go
unheard from.  We can also look at externally maintained features of
interest
to embedded users, and try and determine what is the blocking factor that
is
stopping it (or parts of it) from being merged upstream, and then assist in
removing those barriers where possible.
</div>


<p>
<b>LWN:</b> What are the specific problems that are faced by embedded
developers
trying to use Linux?  What can you do to make that situation better?

<div class="BigQuote">
<b>David</b>: I think the biggest single problem has always been the same&mdash;it's that
people are too focused on getting their stuff out the door as quickly as
possible without much thought to working with upstream. Managers aren't
budgeting the time to get things merged, and engineers aren't talking
about their design early enough that it can be improved before it's a
fait accompli.

That extra time isn't just about being a good citizen&mdash;failing to do
it almost <i>always</i> comes back to bite you personally, when you come to
do a new product, a product update, or even need to merge in changes
from upstream to fix bugs. But <i>everybody</i> seems to need to learn that
the hard way, it seems.

</div>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<b>Paul</b>: A lot of times, you get the situation where a group who is
developing for an
embedded platform is focused 100% on getting their product up, running and
deployed.  The developers involved aren't necessarily hard core Linux
folks,
and it usually plays out by them picking a kernel version, getting their
stuff
in their local tree, and that is it.  They may not know git, they probably
don't have insight into who the respective subsystem maintainers are, they
may
perceive LKML as too hostile, or they may not have management buy-in on
trying
to push stuff upstream.  But inevitably, some time passes, and then they
have a
carry forward task where they try and do a big jump uprev of all their
changes,
and this repeats forever. 
<p>
Most people who have had to endure the jump uprev vs. a continual tracking
and
carrying of changes will tell you the jump is not the way to go for a
multitude
of reasons, but it seems a lesson that everybody ends up having to learn on
their own.  So, I'm hoping we can get some of these people more aligned
with
the typical Linux developer workflow&mdash;i.e. work from the latest codebase,
create logical changesets that can be submission candidates etc.  I've been
in
a couple of meetings recently where we've had the opportunity to educate
embedded developers on the advantages of doing this, and the feedback has
been
positive so far.
</div>



<p>
<b>LWN:</b> The size of the kernel is getting larger in general, is it
getting 
too big for some embedded applications?  What, if anything, should 
be done to remedy that situation?

<div class="BigQuote">
<b>David</b>: I know there are people who'll want to take me out back and
shoot me for
this, but I think a large part of the solution to that is knowing when
Linux is the answer, and accepting that sometimes it isn't. I've always
been a bit dubious about implementing XIP support in Linux, for example,
on the basis that if you care <i>that</i> much, you should probably have been
using something like eCos anyway.
<p>
Getting back to the real question, though, there <i>are</i> things we can do.
The smaller, more efficient "slub" memory allocator is an example, as is the
<tt>--combine</tt> thing I mentioned above. The trick is to find ways to improve
matters without just littering the whole thing with ifdefs.
</div>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<b>Paul</b>: There will always be some hardware or some use case where
Linux isn't
the right choice.  It only makes sense to use the right tool for the
job.  However we do want to make sure that Linux is that right tool in
as many cases as possible.   On the plus side, the resources that are
found on a typical embedded target today are a lot more rich than they
were years ago.  We just need to make sure that in optimizing for the
general x86 use case, we don't inadvertently hinder these more fringe
use cases coming from the embedded world.
</div>



<p>
<b>LWN:</b> What do you see as the priorities for kernel work to better
support
embedded Linux?

<div class="BigQuote">
<b>David</b>: One important priority right now is replacing JFFS2. I wrote
it, so I'm
allowed to say that&mdash;it was good for its time, with NOR flash devices
on the order of 32MiB. But having made it work on 1GiB of NAND flash in
OLPC, I certainly agree with the observation that it's being pushed past
its design limits. I'm very keen to get LogFS and/or UBIFS merged into
the kernel and stabilised to the point where we can really start moving
to them.
<p>
We need to revamp the MTD API fairly urgently too. It was derived from
the PCMCIA code we had at the time without much planning, and we really
need to improve on it now.
<p>
There may be a certain amount of bias in the items I've picked out, I
suppose.

</div>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<b>Paul</b>: The embedded community as a whole is probably the biggest user
of all the
architectures outside of the x86 based platforms.  Sometimes the
functionality
of certain things don't get much testing outside of the basic x86 family.
For
example, one of the features that there is considerable interest in is the
full
preempt_rt patch set.  Yet once you stray outside of the x86 family, you
are
pretty much guaranteed to run into drivers specific to embedded targets
that
don't play nice once this patch set is in place.  This isn't such a
surprise,
simply because the intersection of the two hasn't been explored yet.  I
think
there is value here in getting these types of intersections explored sooner
rather than later, by reducing some of the gap between the people working
on
these sorts of features, and those intending to use them on embedded platforms.
</div>



<p>
<b>LWN:</b> Do you have any specific goals for timelines of getting various
features merged?

<div class="BigQuote">
<b>David</b>: Other than "ASAP" for LogFS and UBIFS, not particularly.
Stuff is merged when it's ready. 
</div>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<b>Paul</b>: At this point in time, no.  I'm not really interested in
hijacking anyone's
project or feature and trying to drive it towards some self-imposed merge
deadline.  I'd rather work with them to try and find out what the problem
areas
are, help with those where possible, be they logistical or technical and
get
them to a point where they feel that they can offer up merge candidates.

</div>



<p>
<b>LWN:</b> What problems do you foresee in working with other kernel
developers 
who may have less (or no) interest in the concerns of the embedded 
community?  Are there specific features that may be difficult or 
impossible to get merged?

<div class="BigQuote">
<b>David</b>: I know it's fashionable to claim there's a big disconnect
between
embedded and big-iron users, but actually there's a lot more overlap
than many people seem to realise. I mentioned XIP earlier; can you also
guess who was first to implement tickless support?
<p>
A lot of the problem has been people who show up and throw their code
over the wall, then run away. Or worse, those who don't even throw it
over the wall at all. People seem to have forgotten how long it took us
to educate the enterprise vendors and get them to work nicely with us;
we're a bit behind the curve on the embedded side but we're getting
there. And organisations like CELF are doing good work on that front,
too.
</div>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<b>Paul</b>: We have to be realistic.  There will always be some features
that either
are too invasive to be sensible merge candidates, or the particular
feature has such a small user base, that it may not make sense from
a carrying cost point of view to target it for inclusion in the standard
kernel.  Fortunately, I think the Linux developer community at large has
generally been flexible in accommodating most things, while at the same
time
excluding things where the best interest of the kernel as a whole needed
to come first.
<p>
In such cases where a feature doesn't look to be a probable merge
candidate,
not all is lost.  We have to capitalize on the remaining value adds that
come
with still working with it as if it was a merge candidate.  Things like
cherry-picking parts of it that are of global value and thus reducing the
carrying cost.  Or being able to voice an opinion at the appropriate time
if
the maintainer of the feature notices that a proposed change somewhere else
in
the kernel will impact the feature that they have been maintaining
independently.  So I think we still want to work towards getting the people
handling these "harder" features of interest to the embedded community
working
more in parallel with the main kernel community.
</div>



<p>
<b>LWN:</b> The term "embedded Linux" covers a huge spectrum of devices and
uses 
of Linux, everything from devices where the OS is completely invisible 
up through internet tablets and UMPC devices that are essentially 
desktops squeezed into a smaller package.  Where on that spectrum do 
your interests lie?  What do you think the challenges of trying to 
support all of those different uses will be?

<div class="BigQuote">
<b>David</b>: My interest is everywhere in that spectrum&mdash;and beyond. Too
much focus
on one small area is the way to ensure that you solve your own problems
while pessimising things for other people. I think it's important to
keep a certain amount of holistic focus, because that's how we can make
sure that Linux scales well both up and down.
</div>

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<b>Paul</b>: Absolutely.  It seems that people naturally associate embedded
with the
small and resource constrained end of the scale.  But the reality is that
there are people who are wanting to use Linux in embedded applications
where
the baseline hardware has 16 cores and gigabytes of memory.  On the one
end of the scale you are interested in things like efficiency of resource
usage, quick boot times, and on the other end of the scale, your interests
are more likely around features relating to specific high availability 
features that may not be present in the standard kernel tree.
<p>
These are clearly separate problem spaces, but the common thing they both
share is that you've got a group using a specific piece of hardware with a
specific use case in mind.  This tends to bring out the "works for us, lets
get
it done and shipping" mentality, and the work tends to never make it out to
where others can review it and look at merging bits that make sense.  I'm
hoping this is where we can make a difference.

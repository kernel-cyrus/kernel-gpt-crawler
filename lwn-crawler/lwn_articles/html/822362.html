Linux capabilities empower the holder to perform a set of specific
privileged operations while withholding the full power of root access; see
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">the
capabilities man page</a> for a list of current capabilities and what they
control.  There have been no capabilities added to the kernel since <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3a101b8de0d3"><tt>CAP_AUDIT_READ</tt></a>
was merged for 3.16 in 2014.  That's about to change with the 5.8 release,
though, which is set to contain two new capabilities; yet another is
currently under development.
<p>
<h4>New capabilities in 5.8</h4>
<p>
The first of the new capabilities is <tt>CAP_PERFMON</tt>, which was <a
href="/Articles/812719/">covered in detail</a> here last February.  With
this capability, a user can perform performance monitoring, attach BPF
programs to tracepoints, and other related actions.  In current kernels,
the catch-all <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability is required for this sort
of performance monitoring; going forward, users can be given more
restricted access.  Of course, a process with <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> will
still be able to do performance monitoring as well; it would be nice to
remove that power from <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>, but doing so would likely
break existing systems.
<p>
The other new capability, <tt>CAP_BPF</tt>, controls many of the actions
that can be carried out with the <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt></a>
system call.  This capability has been the subject of a number of long and
intense conversations over the last year; see <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190627201923.2589391-1-songliubraving@fb.com/">this
thread</a> or <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190827205213.456318-1-ast@kernel.org/">this one</a> for
examples.  The original idea was to provide <a href="/Articles/792124/">a
special device called <tt>/dev/bpf</tt></a> that would control access to
<a href="/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> functionality, but that proposal did
not get far.  What was being 
provided was, in essence, a new capability, so capabilities seemed like a
better solution.
<p>
The current <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> controls a number of BPF-specific operations,
including the creation of BPF maps, use of a number of advanced BPF program
features (<a href="/Articles/794934/">bounded loops</a>, cross-program
function calls, etc.), access to <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html">BPF type format
(BTF)</a> data, and more. 
While the original plan was to <i>not</i> retain backward compatibility for
processes holding <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> in an attempt to avoid what Alexei
Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/netdev/20190828044340.zeha3k3cmmxgfqj7@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">described</a>
as the "<q>deprecated mess</q>", the code that was actually merged does
still recognize <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>.
<p>
One interesting aspect of <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> is that, on its own, it does not
confer the power to do much that is useful.  Crucially, it is still not
possible to load most types of BPF programs with just <tt>CAP_BPF</tt>; to
do that, a process must hold other capabilities relevant to the subsystem
of interest.  For example, programs for tracepoints, kprobes, or perf
events can only be loaded if the process also holds <tt>CAP_PERFMON</tt>.
Most program types related to networking (packet classifiers, <a
href="/Articles/750845/">XDP</a> programs, etc.) require
<tt>CAP_NET_ADMIN</tt>.  If a user wants to load a program for a networking
function that calls <tt>bpf_trace_printk()</tt>, then both
<tt>CAP_NET_ADMIN</tt> and <tt>CAP_PERFMON</tt> are required.
It is thus the <i>combination</i> of <tt>CAP_BPF</tt>
with other capabilities that grants the ability to use BPF in specific
ways.
<p>
Additionally, some BPF operations still require <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>.
Offloading BPF programs into hardware is one example.  Another one is
iterating through BPF objects — programs, maps, etc. — to see what is
loaded in the system.  The ability to look up a map, for example, would
give a process the ability to change maps belonging to other users and
with it, the potential for all sorts of mayhem.  Thus the bar for such
activities is higher.
<p>
The end result of this work is that it will be possible to do quite a bit
of network administration, performance monitoring, and tracing work without
full root (or even full <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>) access.  
<p>
<h4>CAP_RESTORE</h4>
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200522055350.806609-1-areber@redhat.com/"><tt>CAP_RESTORE</tt>
proposal</a> was posted in late May; its purpose is to allow the
checkpointing and restoring of processes by (otherwise) unprivileged
processes.  Patch author Adrian Reber wrote that this is nearly possible today
using the <a href="/Articles/525675/">checkpoint/restore in user space</a>
(CRIU)
feature that has been under development for many years.  There are a few
remaining obstacles, though, one of which is process IDs.  Ideally, a
process could be checkpointed and restored, perhaps on a different system,
without even noticing that anything had happened.  If the process's ID
changes, though, that could be surprising and could lead to bad
results.  So the CRIU developers would like the ability to restore a
process using the same ID (or IDs for a multi-threaded process) it had when
it was checkpointed, assuming that the desired IDs are available, of course.
<p>
Setting the ID of a new process is possible with <a
href="/Articles/792628/"><tt>clone3()</tt></a>, but this feature is not
available to unprivileged processes.  The ability to create processes with a
chosen ID would make a number of attacks easier, so ID setting is
restricted to processes with, of course, <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>.
Administrators tend to balk at handing out that capability, so CRIU users
have been resorting to a number of workarounds; Reber listed a few that
vary from the reasonable to the appalling:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Containers that can be put into user namespaces can, of course,
     control process IDs within their namespaces without any particular
     difficulty.  But that is evidently not a solution for everybody.
<li> Some high-performance computing users run CRIU by way of a setuid
     wrapper to gain the needed capabilities.
<li> Some users run <a
     href="https://github.com/twosigma/set_ns_last_pid">the equivalent of a
     fork bomb</a>, quickly creating (and killing) processes to cycle
     through the process-ID space up to the desired      value.
<li> Java virtual-machine developers would evidently like to use CRIU to
     short out their long startup times; they have been simply patching out
     the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> checks in their kernel (a workaround that
     led Casey Schaufler to <a
     href="/ml/linux-kernel/dc86dffb-c7f8-15bb-db4e-be135da650cc@schaufler-ca.com/">exclaim</a>:
     "<q>That's not a workaround, it's a policy violation.  Bad JVM! No
     biscuit!</q>").
</ul>
<p>
Reber reasonably suggested that it should be possible to find a better
solution than those listed above, and said that <tt>CAP_RESTORE</tt>
would be a good fit.
<p>
Discussion of this patch focused on a couple of issues, starting with
whether it was needed at all.  Schaufler, in particular, wanted to know
what the new capability would buy, and whether it would truly be sufficient
to carry out the checkpoint and restore operations without still needing
<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>.  Just splitting something out of
<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt>, he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cc9e5272-795f-9275-ba93-90233bf1addd@schaufler-ca.com/">said</a>,
is not useful by itself:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If we broke out CAP_SYS_ADMIN properly we'd have hundreds of
	capabilities, and no one would be able to manage the capability
	sets on anything. Just breaking out of CAP_SYS_ADMIN, especially if
	the process is going to need other capabilities anyway, gains you
	nothing.
</div>
<p>
It does seem that <tt>CAP_RESTORE</tt> may, in the end, be sufficient for
this task, though, so Schaufler's objections seemed to fade over time.
<p>
The other question that came up was: what other actions would eventually be
made possible with this new capability?  The patch hinted at others, but
they were not implemented.  The main one appears to be the ability to read
the entries in <tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/map_files</tt> in order to be able to
properly dump out various mappings during the checkpoint procedure.  The
next version of the patch will have an implementation of this behavior as
well.  Some developers wondered whether there should be <i>two</i> new
capabilities, with the second being <tt>CAP_CHECKPOINT</tt>, to cover the
actions specific to each procedure; that change may not happen without
further pressure, though.
<p>
The final form of this patch remains to be seen; security-related changes
can require a lot of discussion and modification before they find their way
in.  But this capability seems useful enough that it will probably end up
merged in some form at some point.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wonder what the use-cases are for CRIU that require putting a migrated process in the same namespaces as other non-migrated processes.<br>
<p>
When it's OK to run the migrated process in its own namespaces, i.e. a container, there isn't really a problem because the migrated process can have (or at least start with) CAP_SYS_ADMIN in those namespaces.<br>

I have long running (multiple months) screen sessions on some production servers to which I connect frequently. To connect to screen you have to specify the unique beginning of the screens pid. All pids beginning with a higher digit as the begin of max-pid are 10 times rarer than those with a lower digit.

A true hacker's hack. Or you could use tmux and the you get access to named sessions/sockets ;) .<br>
<p>
This probably works much better when pids are small (when uptime is low). Now to get such a pid after you already have pid 1000000 spawned, your process comet probably takes a non-negligible amount of time. And then you're stuck with another million or so pids until it is unique again.<br>

<p>
The uptime doesn't factor in. The production systems of our customers mostly have max-pid of 64k with a high uptime. The pid wraps around after a few hours to a few days. So if someone other starts a screen from the shared admin-account it gets a pid nearly at random. The pids starting from 1 to 5 are from a set of 11111 numbers (disregarding special pids like 1) and pids starting from 7 to 9 are from a set of 1111.<br>
<p>
while [[ $(readlink /proc/self) != 9* ]]; do :; done &amp;&amp; screen -S Jandar<br>
<p>
As normally at most a handful screen are running, the chance to have 9* exclusively for myself is high because no workmate uses the shell-prompt to type in loops. Probability with 5 other screen = (1-1111/2^16)^5 = .91807.<br>

<p>
I was going to say: it doesn't work that way, but I tested it before commenting. In reality it does work.<br>
<p>
The only explanation I have is, that the manual shows contradicting usages.<br>
<p>
1) from the Synopsis:<br>
       screen -r [[pid.]tty[.host]]<br>
2) from the section COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS:<br>
       -r [pid.tty.host]<br>
       -r sessionowner/[pid.tty.host]<br>
In 2) the pid seems to be not optional and the sessionname from -S sessionname<br>
 only substitutes tty.host. The text description for -r says "prefix of [pid.]tty.host" so pid seems optional.<br>
<p>
I have never tested if screen -r sessionname works, I've always assumed pid is mandatory. *facepalm*<br>

I use "screen -dRR -S &lt;sessionname&gt; ..." all the time, from a script that knows how to connect to whatever target board I specify.<br>
<p>
There is one caveat though: if a session name is an abbreviation of another session name, and the session with the shorter name doesn't exist yet, then screen will happily connect to the (wrong) session with the longer name instead.  Once the session has been created, everything works as expected, though.<br>
Solution: create your sessions in the right order, so they never match an existing one.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;Setting the ID of a new process is possible with clone3(), but this feature is not available to unprivileged processes. The ability to create processes with a chosen ID would make a number of attacks easier, so ID setting is restricted to processes with, of course, CAP_SYS_ADMIN. Administrators tend to balk at handing out that capability, so CRIU users have been resorting to a number of workarounds; Reber listed a few that vary from the reasonable to the appalling:</font><br>
So what are you supposed to do if some other process starts using that PID?<br>
<p>
I don't get what the issue is with using a PID namespace. It seems like it fixes both the permissions issue and the collision issue.<br>

Each PID namespace starts PIDs from 1. So this shouldn't be an issue.<br>

Obviously, you're supposed to send them a SIGSEGV with kill(2), and hope whoever's responsible for that binary never figures out their impossible-to-reproduce segfault bug.<br>

For example, RPM packages define metadata about files shipped in the package. Owner, permission, ACL, xattrs, capabilities etc. When package is installed, all those attributes are set to match. <br>
This look like following in RPM .spec file:<br>
<p>
%attr(0755,root,root) %caps(cap_net_raw=p) %{_bindir}/arping<br>
<p>
This way “arping” command can be run without special privileges. Some more information: <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/RemoveSETUID">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/RemoveSETUID</a><br>

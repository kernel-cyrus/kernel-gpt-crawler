<h1>Volatile ranges and MADV_FREE</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 19, 2014</br>
           </div>
Within the kernel, the "shrinker" interface allows the memory-management
subsystem to inform other subsystems that memory is tight and that some
space should be freed if possible.  Various attempts have been made to add
a similar mechanism that would allow the kernel to ask user-space processes
to do some tidying up, but all have run up against the familiar problems of
complexity and the general difficulty of getting memory-management changes
merged.  That doesn't stop developers
from trying, though; recently two new patches of this type have been
posted.  
<p>
Both of these patch sets implement variations on a feature that has often
gone by the 
name <a href="/Kernel/Index/#Volatile_ranges">volatile ranges</a>.  A
volatile range is a region of memory in a process's address space that is
used to store data that can be regenerated if need be.  If the kernel finds
itself short of memory, it can take pages from a volatile range, secure in
the knowledge that the process using that range of memory can recover from
the loss, albeit with a possible performance hit.  But, as long as memory
remains plentiful, volatile ranges will not be reclaimed by the kernel and
the data cached there can be freely used by applications.
<p>
Much of the volatile range work is motivated by the desire to create a
replacement for Android's <a
href="http://elinux.org/Android_Kernel_Features#ashmem">ashmem</a>
mechanism that is better integrated with the core memory-management
subsystem.  But there are other potential users of this functionality as 
well.

<p>
<h4>Volatile ranges</h4>
<p>
There have been many versions of the volatile ranges patch set over the
last few years.  At times, volatile ranges were implemented with the
<tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> system call; at others, it was added to
<tt>fallocate()</tt> instead.  Other versions have made it a feature of
<tt>madvise()</tt>.  But <a href="/Articles/590771/">version 11 of the
volatile ranges patch set</a> from John Stultz takes none of those
approaches.  Instead, it adds a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
	int vrange(void *start, size_t length, int mode, int *purged);
</pre>
<p>
In this incarnation, a <tt>vrange()</tt> call operates on the
<tt>length</tt> bytes of memory beginning at <tt>start</tt>.  If
<tt>mode</tt> is <tt>VRANGE_VOLATILE</tt>, that range of memory will be
marked as volatile.  If, instead, <tt>mode</tt> is
<tt>VRANGE_NONVOLATILE</tt>, the volatile marking will be removed.  In this
case, though, some or all of the pages previously marked as being volatile
might have been reclaimed; in that case, <tt>*purged</tt> will be set to a
non-zero value to indicate that the previous contents of that memory range
are no longer available.  If <tt>*purged</tt> is set to zero, the
application knows that the memory contents have not been lost.
<p>
A process may continue to access memory contained within a volatile range.
Should it attempt to access a page that has been reclaimed, though, it will
get a <tt>SIGBUS</tt> signal to indicate that the page is no longer there.
Thus, programs that are prepared to handle that signal can use volatile
ranges without the need for a second <tt>vrange()</tt> call before actually
accessing the memory.
<p>
This version of the patch differs from its predecessors in another
significant way: it only works with anonymous pages while the previous
versions worked only with the tmpfs filesystem.  Working with anonymous pages
satisfies the need to simplify the patch set as much as possible in the
hope of getting it reviewed and eventually merged, but it has a significant
cost: the inability to work with tmpfs means that volatile ranges are not a
viable replacement for ashmem.  The intent is to support the file-backed
case (which adds more complexity) after there is consensus on the basic
patch. 
<p>
Internally, <tt>vrange()</tt> works at the virtual memory area (VMA)
level.  All pages within a VMA are either volatile or not; if need be, VMAs
will be split or coalesced in response to <tt>vrange()</tt> calls.  This
should make a <tt>vrange()</tt> call reasonably fast since there is no need
to iterate over every page in the range.
<p>
<h4>MADV_FREE</h4>
<p>
A different approach to a similar problem can be seen in Minchan Kim's <a
href="/Articles/590693/"><tt>MADV_FREE</tt></a> patch set.  This patch adds
a new command to the existing <tt>madvise()</tt> system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int madvise(void *addr, size_t length, int advice);
</pre>
<p>
Like <tt>vrange()</tt>, <tt>madvise()</tt> operates on a range of memory
specified by the caller; what it does is determined by the <tt>advice</tt>
argument.  Callers can specify <tt>MADV_SEQUENTIAL</tt> to tell the kernel
that the pages in that range will be accessed sequentially, or
<tt>MADV_RANDOM</tt> to indicate the opposite.  The <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt>
call causes the kernel to reclaim the indicated pages immediately and drop
their contents.
<p>
The new <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> operation is similar to <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt>,
but there is an important difference.  Rather than reclaiming the pages
immediately, this operation marks them for "lazy freeing" at some future
point.  Should the kernel run low on memory, these pages will be among the
first reclaimed for other uses; should the application try to use such a
page after it has been reclaimed, the kernel will give it a new,
zero-filled page.  But if memory is not tight, pages marked with
<tt>MADV_FREE</tt> will
remain in place; a future access to those pages will clear the "lazy free"
bit and use the memory that was there before the <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> call.
<p>
There is no way for the calling application to know if the contents of
those pages have been discarded or not without examining the data
contained therein.  So a program could conceivably implement something
similar to volatile ranges by putting a recognizable structure into each page
before the <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> operation, then testing for that structure's
presence before accessing any other data in the pages.  But that does not
seem to be the intended use case for this feature.
<p>
Instead, <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> appears to be aimed at user-space memory
allocator implementations.  When an application frees a set of pages, the
allocator will use an <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> call to tell the kernel that the
contents of those pages no longer matter.  Should the application quickly
allocate more memory in the same address range, it will use the same pages,
thus avoiding much of the overhead of freeing the old pages and allocating
and zeroing the new ones.  In short, <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> is meant as a way
to say "I don't care about the data in this address range, but I may reuse
the address range itself in the near future."
<p>
It's worth noting that <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> is already supported by BSD
kernels, so, unlike <tt>vrange()</tt>, it would not be a Linux-only
feature.  Indeed, it would likely improve the portability of programs
that use this feature on BSD systems now.
<p>
Neither patch has received much in the way of reviews as of this writing.
The real review, in any case, is likely to happen at this year's <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-storage-filesystem-and-mm-summit">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit</a>, which begins on
March&nbsp;24.  LWN will be there, and we promise to make at least a token
effort to not be too distracted by the charms of California wine country; stay
tuned for reports from that discussion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The purged thing makes no sense to me, there is a race condition so surely you have to deal with the signal.anyway. But an interface with signals is ugly. I think pages that may just zero and using a sentinel is actually easier to code for.<br>

It's not a race. When thread 1 reads the sentinel the MADV_FREE advice is dropped, so thread 2's activity won't cause the page to be reclaimed.<br>

You have to deal with the signal anyway, but signal dispatch is notably slow: checking for purgedness first should reduce the frequency of signals in this case by an order of magnitude or so.<br>

Just a small clarifications: While I sent out v11 and had reworked most of the changes myself for this release, it started with a code base Minchan and I have been working on (off and on) for last year together, which also included introducing the vrange syscall (mostly because madvise doesn't provide the needed semantics for properly handling both errors and providing info on purged state of the range). I really want to make sure Minchan gets credit for this, because he has really been the heavy lifter on the patch set over the last 3 revisions or so, and his contributions have been critical.<br>
<p>
My main focus with the v11 release is to pair back the scope of the functionality and to stay within common mm code practices (both suggested by Johannes Weiner on his review of Minchan's v10 release) in order to keep the patch small and get more reviewer interest on the basic semantics.<br>
<p>
Similarly Minchan's MADV_FREE is splitting off a usage case that we had earlier tried to fit within the volatile ranges interface, and trying to simply implement that functionality on its own.<br>
<p>
Basically the problem with earlier volatile ranges patches was that we had adopted too many use cases, which all had subtle performance requirements and semantics. This made it difficult for reviewers to understand. So we're sort of blowing up the old patch set and seeing if we can get the same utility from separate simpler and smaller parts.<br>

Also... regarding the bit about "This should make a vrange() call reasonably fast since there is no need to iterate over every page in the range."<br>
<p>
The v11 actually does have to iterate over the pages in the range when marking non-volatile in order to detect purged pages. Its also likely that we will touch the pages in the range when marking volatile in order to make sure the pages are all of the same "age" on the lru, and are more likely to be purged together (so we don't purge one page from a number of different volatile ranges, requiring lots of data to eventually have to be regenerated).<br>
<p>
These are both performance tradeoffs that we're willing to take in order to keep within existing mm code standards, and for the code to get reviewer interest.  If the semantics are well understood and an implementaiton is merged, I'd like to eventually revisit some of the performance aspects.<br>

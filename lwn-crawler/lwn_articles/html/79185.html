<h1>Capabilities in 2.6</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted April 6, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>

<div class="ArticleText">
The kernel capability mechanism gives (relatively) fine-grained control
over what actions any given process can perform.  The various capabilities
include the ability to override file permissions, send signals to other
processes, bind to low-numbered ports, and many other tasks.  There have
been visions over the years of exporting capabilities to user space and
eliminating the "all-powerful superuser" concept, but none of those visions
have been implemented in any sort of widely-distributed sort of way.
<p>
One of the capabilities is called <tt>CAP_IPC_LOCK</tt>; it gives a process
the ability to lock a region of virtual memory into physical RAM.  This
capability needs to be controlled; otherwise a rogue process could lock up
all of physical memory and effectively shut down the system.  There are,
however, legitimate reasons for giving this capability to normal users.
Programs which handle encryption (such as gpg) would like to lock in some
of their memory so that passphrases and clear text do not get written out
to swap.  Systems like Oracle need the capability to lock in their shared
segments (since they do their own paging, essentially) and to be able to
allocate large page "hugetlb" segments.
<p>
To this end, Andrea Arcangeli posted <a href="/Articles/79110/">a patch</a>
which allows the system administrator to disable <tt>CAP_IPC_LOCK</tt>
checking via a sysctl variable.  With those checks disabled, any
non-privileged process can lock pages into memory or allocate large-page
shared memory segments.  Andrea asked for the patch to be incorporated into
the 2.6 mainline.
<p>
The patch inspired some thinking on how best to make certain capabilities
available to users.  There has been <a
href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107980096115231&w=2">a
patch</a> in circulation for a while which simply opens up memory locking
to everybody, but which puts a resource limit on the number of pages which
can be locked.  The default limit is a single page, which works for gpg but
which does not easily threaten the system as a whole.  With a suitably
adjusted limit, this patch should work for Oracle as well - but it does not
address the large-page shared memory issue.
<p>
William Lee Irwin put together <a href="/Articles/79204/">a different
patch</a> which allows the administrator to turn off checks for any
capability via a set of sysctl variables.  It differs from Andrea's patch
in its generality, but also by virtue of using the security module
framework rather than direct changes to the kernel core.  Some people
seemed to like this patch better, though there was some nervousness about
its overall security which led William to add <a href="/Articles/79205/">a
strong comment</a> and <a href="/Articles/79206/">a lockdown capability</a>
to the patch.
<p>
Given that the whole idea behind capabilities was to be able to give
specific capabilities to individual users, however, some developers
wondered why the current system couldn't be used.  To this end, Andrew
Morton <a href="/Articles/79207/">looked into hacking <tt>login</tt></a> to
enable it to give capabilities to users.  He was not impressed with what he
found once he started trying to work with kernel capabilities: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">

	It turns out that the whole "drop capabilities and then run
	something" thing does not work in either 2.4 or 2.6.  And hasn't
	done since forever.  What we have in there is no more useful than
	suser()...
	<p>

	I must say that I'm fairly disappointed that we developed and
	merged all that fancy security stuff but nobody ever bothered to
	fix up the existing simple capability code.

	Particularly as, apparently, the new security stuff STILL cannot
	solve the extremely simple Oracle-wants-CAP_IPC_LOCK requirement.
</div>
<p>

It was <a href="/Articles/79208/">pointed out</a> that SELinux can, in
fact, solve this problem.  But that will be little comfort to those who are
not yet ready to adopt SELinux for their production systems.  
<p>
The problem may originate from the fact that the visions of fully
capability-driven systems involve assigning capabilities to all executables
and having a process's capabilities tweaked every time a new program is
run.  That part of the system has never been merged into the mainline,
partly because nobody has ever really figured out how to deal with system
administration when every file has another 32 permissions bits added onto
it.  The end result, in any case, is that the capability subsystem has
never worked quite as it should.  Given that Andrew is the gatekeeper,
chances are good that some sort of fix for that problem will get into the
kernel before any sort of more complicated solution to the problem of
giving capabilities to users.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I wonder if Linux might benefit from looking at OpenBSD's <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=systrace">systrace</a> 
facility.  Systrace isn't quite like Linux Capabilities, since it deals 
with access to system calls rather than underlying actions, but it seems 
fairly similar on a functional level.  Maybe the interface used for 
systrace could benefit Linux.

      SELinux is much more than capabilities: <br>  - More fine grained configurable <br>  - Can prevent users to share access given to them <br>  - Is role based, not just user or process <br>  - Is more complex to administer <br>So you can do more with SELinux, but the price is a lot more work. <br>

      The whole capability system is not very fine grained.  In fact, all<br>capabilities are all super-user privileges.  The ability to lock up the<br>system or escalate priviledges is highly likely if any of the capabilities<br>are granted.  And some of them like CAP_SYS_ADMIN are grab-bags of<br>unrelated priviledges.  Why can't some normal user priviledges be worked<br>into the scheme CAP_LISTEN, CAP_CONNECT, CAP_PTRACE,<br>CAP_EXECSUID, CAP_USRCHOWN, CAP_USRCHMOD, etc.?  With these<br>I could actually use capabilities to harden systems.  As they are I can<br>only lock down the root account which isn't too useful when nothing runs as<br>root anyway.

      I would note, that I've used vserver for quite some time on 2.4 (and pathces are in dev -and released in alpha-state, for 2.6 - using them on my laptop) to enable exactly this capability handling. Vserver strips ALL capabilities - even from root - but you can very easily add a capability pr. vserver - and as you are supposed to run each service in a seperate vserver (this has no notable overhead), you could easily add the mentioned capability to the vserver running oracle.<p>Vserver works rather simply - and does not reserve memory for each vserver etc. this makes it very lightweight. see http://www.linux-vserver.org <br>Perhaps the kernel coders should have a look at how the capabilities are used there? - as it works rather well.

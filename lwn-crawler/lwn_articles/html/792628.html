<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 5, 2019</br>
           </div>
The kernel development community continues to propose new system calls at a
high rate.  Three ideas that are currently in circulation on the mailing
lists are <tt>clone3()</tt>, <tt>fchmodat4()</tt>, and <tt>fsinfo()</tt>.
In some cases, developers are just trying to make more flag bits available,
but there is also some significant new functionality being discussed.
<p>
<h4><tt>clone3()</tt></h4>
<p>
The <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone()</a></tt>
system call creates a new process or thread; it is the actual machinery
behind <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html"><tt>fork()</tt></a>.
Unlike <tt>fork()</tt>, <tt>clone()</tt> accepts a <tt>flags</tt> argument
to modify how it operates.  Over time, quite a few flags have been added;
most of these control what resources and namespaces are to be shared with
the new child process.  In fact, so many flags have been added that, when
<tt>CLONE_PIDFD</tt> was merged for 5.2, the last available flag bit was
taken.  That puts an end to the extensibility of <tt>clone()</tt>.
<p>
The natural solution is to clone the <tt>clone()</tt> system call into a
new one that would be able to accept more flags.  Christian Brauner,
perhaps feeling guilty for having snagged the last flag for
<tt>CLONE_PIDFD</tt>, set out to do this work.  His first attempt was
called <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190526102612.6970-1-christian@brauner.io/"><tt>clone6()</tt></a>
but, after some discussion, it was downgraded to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190604160944.4058-1-christian@brauner.io/"><tt>clone3()</tt></a>.
(For the curious, there is a <tt>clone2()</tt> that appears to only be of
interest on the ia64 architecture).  The prototype for this system call
looks something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct clone_args {
        u64 flags;
        int *pidfd;
        int *child_tid;
        int *parent_tid;
        int exit_signal;
        unsigned long stack;
        unsigned long stack_size;
        unsigned long tls;
    };

    int clone3(struct clone_args *args, size_t size);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>clone_args</tt> structure contains much of the information that was
previously passed directly to <tt>clone()</tt> or crammed into the
<tt>flags</tt> field.  The new <tt>flags</tt> is wider (64&nbsp;bits on all
architectures) and regains some space due to the relocation of information like
the exit signal number.  That should provide enough flags to last, as they
say, "for a while".
<p>
The <tt>size</tt> argument is the size of the <tt>clone_args</tt> structure
itself.  Should there ever be a need to expand that structure in the future, the
kernel will be able to tell whether any given user-space caller is using
the new or the old version of the structure by examining <tt>size</tt> and
do the right thing either way.
So, with luck, there should be no need to create a <tt>clone4()</tt>
anytime soon.
<p>
This interface seems to be satisfactory to everybody involved, though Jann
Horn did <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez2wyDhM-V1hs5ya1R4x7wHT=T8XLOYCPUyw97kzzLhbhg@mail.gmail.com/">point
out</a> one significant problem: the seccomp mechanism is unable to examine
system-call arguments that are passed in separate structures, so it will be
unable to make decisions based on the flags given to <tt>clone3()</tt>.
That, he said, means that code meant to be sandboxed with seccomp may not
use <tt>clone3()</tt> at all.  Kees Cook has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/201905301122.88FD40B3@keescook/">suggested</a> a new
mechanism for fetching user-space data for system calls that could be used
by seccomp, but nobody appears to be working on that idea currently.
<p>
Meanwhile, <tt>clone3()</tt> is in linux-next, and so can be expected to
appear in 5.3.
<p>
<h4><tt>fchmodat4()</tt></h4>
<p>
A look at <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chmod.2.html">the man page
for <tt>fchmodat()</tt></a> reveals the following prototype:
<p>
<pre>
    int fchmodat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, mode_t mode, int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>flags</tt> argument is documented to have one possible value:
<tt>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</tt>, which would cause <tt>fchmodat()</tt> to
operate directly on a symbolic link rather than its target.  There's only
one little problem: <tt>fchmodat()</tt> as implemented in the kernel does
not actually accept a <tt>flags</tt> argument.  That is why the man page
concludes with: "<q>This flag is not currently implemented</q>".
<p>
Palmer Dabbelt was motivated to action by a seemingly unpleasant
experience: "<q>I spent half of dinner last night being complained to by
one of our hardware engineers about Linux's lack of support for the flags
argument to <tt>fchmodat()</tt></q>".  The result was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190531191204.4044-1-palmer@sifive.com/">a patch
set</a> implementing support for <tt>fchmodat4()</tt>, which has the same
prototype as <tt>fchmodat()</tt> but which actually implements the
<tt>flags</tt> argument.
<p>
This patch set seems uncontroversial, so there should be no real barrier to
its merging, though it has not yet found its way into linux-next.
<p>
<h4><tt>fsinfo()</tt></h4>
<p>
The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statfs.2.html"><tt>statfs()</tt></a>
system call can be used to get certain types of information about a
filesystem, including its format, block size, available free blocks,
maximum file-name length, and so on.  But it turns out that there is a lot
more to know about a filesystem than that, and <tt>statfs()</tt> is unable
to provide that information.  It seems like a situation just begging for
somebody to come along and implement <tt>statfs2()</tt>, but instead we get
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/156173661696.14042.17822154531324224780.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/"><tt>fsinfo()</tt></a>
from David Howells.
<p>
The prototype for <tt>fsinfo()</tt> looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct fsinfo_params {
	__u32	at_flags;
	__u32	request;
	__u32	Nth;
	__u32	Mth;
	__u64	__reserved[3];
    };

    int fsinfo(int dfd, const char *filename,
    	       const struct fsinfo_params *params, void *buffer,
	       size_t buf_size);
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>dfd</tt> and <tt>filename</tt> arguments identify the filesystem
about which information is needed.  <tt>params</tt> is an optional array
describing the requested information, while <tt>buffer</tt> and
<tt>buf_size</tt> define the output buffer.
<p>
If <tt>params</tt> is null, the returned information will be essentially
the same as what <tt>statfs()</tt> would provide.  But it is possible to
get more, including limits on the filesystem's capabilities, timestamp
resolution, mount-time parameters, remote server information, and more.
Once <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/156173681842.14728.9331700785061885270.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">this
patch set</a> is applied, <tt>fsinfo()</tt> will also be able to return
information about the system's mount topology.
<p>
This system call is complex, to say the least; there is not space here to
try to describe how it all works.  Fortunately, there is some good
documentation provided with it.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/156173671169.14042.2848093993797220779.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">This
patch</a> provides a fair amount of information about what
<tt>fsinfo()</tt> can do, liberally intermixed with API information for
filesystem developers.  But see also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/156173687101.14728.6401356872306559415.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">this
patch</a> for information on how the mount-topology queries work, and <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/156173668587.14042.3095176129086856318.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">this
one</a> for the somewhat baroque mechanism used to format parameter values
passed back to user space.  
<p>
While there is clear value in the creation of an interface for extracting
arbitrary filesystem-related information from the kernel, the complexity of
the <tt>fsinfo()</tt> patch set has proved daunting to reviewers, who have
asked for it to be broken up in the past.  Filesystem developers have, in
recent years, become more insistent that new features come with additions
to the xfstests suite as well; those have not yet been provided in
this case.  <tt>fsinfo()</tt> has been circulating for a while — Howells <a
href="/ml/linux-api/153314002975.18964.1773855756473041897.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">posted
a version</a> nearly one year ago — but chances are good that it will need
to circulate for a bit longer still before it's ready for the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Oh, right...I forgot Linux doesn't have a lchmod() either.  All my own<br>
use cases use fchmod() on files that are already open (potentially with<br>
O_NOFOLLOW), or set umask so the file doesn't have the wrong permissions<br>
in the first place.  Or I put on my grumpy sysadmin hat and hand the<br>
entire problem to chmod(1) which does a symlink check with (manageable)<br>
TOCTTOU problems.  It's an API gap that is so old I can't see it's there<br>
any more.<br>
<p>
So "chmod a symlink" wouldn't be expected to work literally--the call<br>
could be ignored or return an error instead.  That seems sane.<br>
<p>
The original patch was talking about some FUSE use case, but didn't say<br>
anything further.  It sounded like someone was planning to do something<br>
(presumably evil) with lrwxr-xr-x symlinks, like maybe restrict readlink()<br>
access.<br>

Coincidentally, I'm actually working on a userspace library that helps avoid TOCTOUs like these (as well as many others)[1]. I sent a patchset for openat2 over the weekend[2] -- but I will probably have to resend it next week so folks actually see it.<br>

My problem with libraries like this is that if people start making extensive use of them, they break my use cases. I make extensive use of bind-mounts, sometimes within source trees, sometimes under my own $HOME, often within larger groups of files that other packages may see as a conceptual whole, as part of what amounts to a hierarchical storage system (shifting some things to uncached storage, faster storage, etc, as needed). This has just worked for decades -- but if programs start insisting that some things not be mount points, this will suddenly break.<br>
<p>
I don't see how this could be considered anything but a userspace regression.<br>

Please make these flags do-nothings if the sysadmin requests it.<br>

      <p>Am I the only one who finds the packing of <tt>struct clone_args</tt> unusual?  For 64-bit architectures it's a single 32-bit field (<tt>exit_signal</tt>) packed between four and three 64-bit fields.</p>

<p>When packing data structures, I was taught to put POD types in descending order of size.  Or perhaps I was just obsessive-compulsive about this.  Or both...</p>

There are 32bits unused after the exit_status field on LP64 architectures, correct, due to the C alignment rules.<br>
Good catch! <br>

The uapi structure is correctly packed to allow 32 bit and 64 bit handling to be identical:<br>
<p>
struct clone_args {<br>
	__aligned_u64 flags;<br>
	__aligned_u64 pidfd;<br>
	__aligned_u64 child_tid;<br>
	__aligned_u64 parent_tid;<br>
	__aligned_u64 exit_signal;<br>
	__aligned_u64 stack;<br>
	__aligned_u64 stack_size;<br>
	__aligned_u64 tls;<br>
};<br>
<p>
The kernel internal struct uses kernel internal types and packing doesn't matter here:<br>
<p>
struct kernel_clone_args {<br>
	u64 flags;<br>
	int __user *pidfd;<br>
	int __user *child_tid;<br>
	int __user *parent_tid;<br>
	int exit_signal;<br>
	unsigned long stack;<br>
	unsigned long stack_size;<br>

No, you’re not the only one, I also wanted to add a comment about this.<br>
<p>
The padding is just ridiculous. Reorder them like this…<br>
<p>
    struct clone_args {<br>
        u64 flags;<br>
        int *pidfd;<br>

That’s the comment I replied to, calling it out for stupidity.<br>
<p>
The uapi structure takes 64 bytes on all architectures.<br>
<p>
My better packing takes 36 bytes on ILP32 and 60 bytes on LP64 only.<br>

      One would think that we could have a technical discussion about structure layouts without resorting to preschool words like "stupidity".  Please try to avoid doing that, OK?
<p>
The structure in question is, of course, a short-lived thing that will not exist in vast quantities in the system, so squeezing every possible byte out of it doesn't seem all that important.

The in-kernel one has implicit padding, which is a concern on at least m68k (with its 16-bit instead of natural alignment).<br>

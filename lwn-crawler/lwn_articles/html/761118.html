           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 27, 2018</br>
           </div>
The kernel's out-of-memory (OOM) killer is summoned when the system runs
short of free memory and is unable to proceed without killing one or more
processes.  As might be expected, the policy decisions around <i>which</i>
processes should be targeted have engendered controversy for as long as the
OOM killer has existed.  The 4.19 development cycle is likely to include
a new OOM-killer implementation that targets control groups rather than
individual processes, but it turns out that there is significant
disagreement over how the OOM killer and control groups should interact.
<p>

To simplify a bit: when the OOM killer is invoked, it tries to pick the
process whose demise will free the most memory while causing the least
misery for users of the system.  The heuristics used to make this selection
have varied considerably over time — it was once remarked that each
developer who changes the heuristics makes them work for their use case
while ruining things for everybody else.  In current kernels, the heuristics
implemented in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/oom_kill.c#L184"><tt>oom_badness()</tt></a>
are relatively simple: sum up the amount of memory used by a process, then
scale it by the process's <tt>oom_score_adj</tt> value.  That value, found
in the process's <tt>/proc</tt> directory, can be tweaked by system
administrators to make specific processes more or less attractive as an
OOM-killer target.
<p>
No OOM-killer implementation is perfect, and this one is no exception.  One
problem is that it does not pay attention to how much memory a particular
<i>user</i> has allocated; it only looks at specific processes.  If user&nbsp;A
has a single large process while user&nbsp;B has 100 smaller ones, the OOM
killer will invariably target A's process, even if B is using far more
memory overall.  That behavior is tolerable on a single-user system, but it
is less than optimal on a large system running containers on behalf of
multiple users.
<p>
<h4>Control-group awareness</h4>
<p>
To address this issue, Roman Gushchin has introduced the <a
href="/Articles/736952/">control-group-aware OOM killer</a>.  It modifies
the OOM-kill algorithm in a fairly straightforward way: first, the control
group with the largest memory consumption is found, then the largest
process running within that group is killed.  There is also a new knob
added to control groups called <tt>memory.oom_group</tt>; if it is set to a
non-zero value, the OOM killer will kill <i>all</i> processes running
within the targeted group instead of just the largest one.  This flag is
useful for 
cases where the processes in a group depend on each other and the whole set
will fail to function properly if one is killed.
<p>
This patch set is in the -mm tree (and thus in linux-next) now, so it is on
the path for merging during the next merge window.  It has proved to be a
relatively controversial feature, though.  There are no real objections to
teaching the OOM killer about control groups, but there is significant
disagreement over just how the OOM killer should treat those groups.  Most
of these complaints can be found summarized in <a
href="/Articles/761121/">this message from David Rientjes</a>.
<p>
The first of these is that processes in the root control group are treated
differently from those in any other group.  The memory-size computation is
different and, importantly, the <tt>oom_score_adj</tt> value is not used
for processes running inside of (non-root) control groups.  That can lead
to surprising results when it come time for the OOM killer to choose a
victim.  Rientjes says that the solution is to use the same heuristic for
all processes and groups.
<p>

Perhaps surprisingly, a number of memory-management developers seem to
disagree with this position.  In a system dedicated to container workloads,
they say, there should be no significant processes running in the root
control group; there should be little in the root beyond kernel threads and
maybe some  system-level daemons.
The <tt>oom_score_adj</tt> knob can still be used to ensure that the OOM
killer will leave those processes alone.  As Johannes Weiner <a
href="/Articles/761122/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
You don't have any control and
no accounting of the stuff situated inside the root cgroup, so it doesn't
make sense to leave anything in there while also using sophisticated
containerization mechanisms like this group oom setting.
</div>
<p>
Rientjes
<a href="/Articles/761123/">finds this argument unconvincing</a>, however.
<p>
Another issue Rientjes pointed out is that the new OOM killer is not
hierarchical; each control group is considered as a separate entity.
Imagine the following simple hierarchy, with the memory usage of each group
shown:
<p>
<blockquote>
  <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/cgoom1.svg" alt="Control group hierarchy"
  width="250">
</blockquote>
<p>
If the OOM killer is brought forth, it will quickly conclude that
Group&nbsp;2 is the problem and will target a process found there.  Thus
far, things are as one might expect.  But if the container running in
Group&nbsp;2 creates some subgroups of its own and splits its workload
between them, the result could look something like this:
<blockquote>
  <img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/cgoom2.svg" alt="Control group hierarchy"
  width="425">
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, Group 1 will look like the biggest group in the system, and
Group&nbsp;2 will escape the OOM killer's attention.  A truly hierarchical
view of the control-group hierarchy (which is generally how things are
supposed to work) would see the 24GB of memory used by Group&nbsp;2 and
kill a process there instead.
<p>
Once again, there is disagreement over whether there is really a problem
here or not.  Many users of control groups may not want the fully
hierarchical behavior.  If one were to substitute "Group&nbsp;1" and
"Group&nbsp;2" with "Accounting" and "Scientists", for example, it might
well seem right that the latter group would use more memory overall.
Besides, accountants are always fair game, so the current system behaves as
it should.
<p>
With regard to the deliberate dodging of the OOM killer by creating
subgroups, the response is that such gaming of the system is possible now.
Small processes will be passed over, while large processes are targeted, so
a clever user could split a task into a large number of processes and get
away with using more memory.  The control-group-aware mechanism doesn't
enable anything new in that regard.
<p>
Finally, Rientjes also complained that, since the <tt>oom_score_adj</tt>
value is ignored within control groups, there is no longer any way for
users to influence how the OOM-killing decision is made.  The answer here
seems to be that the <tt>oom_score_adj</tt> mechanism is unwieldy and not
particularly useful anyway.  As Michal Hocko <a
href="/Articles/761127/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	oom_score_adj is basically unusable for any fine tuning on the
	process level for most setups except for very specialized ones. The
	only reasonable usage I've seen so far was to disable OOM killer
	for a process or make it a prime candidate. Using the same limited
	concept for cgroups sounds like repeating the same error to me.
</div>
<p>
Rientjes, naturally, <a href="/Articles/761128/">disagreed</a>, saying:
"<q>The ability to protect important cgroups and bias against
non-important cgroups is vital to any selection implementation</q>".  He
further argued that this feature should be incorporated before the new OOM
killer
goes upstream to avoid changing user-visible behavior in future kernel
releases.
<p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>

These concerns notwithstanding, the control-group-aware OOM-killer patches
have landed in the -mm tree.  That is not an absolute guarantee that they
will go into the mainline; -mm maintainer Andrew Morton often puts
interesting work there to see what problems turn up.  Rientjes has not
given up, though; he has been working on <a href="/ml/cgroups/alpine.DEB.2.21.1807131604560.217600@chino.kir.corp.google.com/">a
patch series</a> of 
his own adding the features he would like to see in the new OOM killer.
The changes he makes include:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> A new <tt>memory.oom_policy</tt> knob is added to control groups.
     Setting it to <tt>none</tt> causes the current largest-process
     heuristic to be used.  A setting of <tt>cgroup</tt> will cause the OOM
     killer to pick the single group with the largest memory usage and
     kill a process within it; setting the root group's policy to
     <tt>cgroup</tt> reproduces the behavior of Gushchin's patch set.
     Finally, a setting of "<tt>tree</tt>" enables a fully hierarchical
     mode.  With this knob, the hierarchical mode is available for those
     who want it; it is also possible to use different modes for different
     subtrees of the control-group hierarchy.

<li> The same heuristic is used to compare processes across all groups,
     including the root group.  When control groups are in use for
     OOM-killer control, the <tt>oom_score_adj</tt> value is ignored with
     one exception: setting it to -999 (still) makes the associated process
     unkillable. 
</ul>
<p>
This patch set is not yet in -mm, but there does not appear to be any real
opposition to it at this point.  It preserves the behavior of the original
control-group-aware OOM killer for those who want it while making other
modes available "<q>for general use</q>" of the feature.  So chances
are good that it will be included when the new OOM killer finds its way
into the mainline.  Of course, chances are equally good that many users
will still be unhappy with how the OOM killer works and will be looking for
yet another set of heuristics to use — it's a traditional part of Linux
kernel development, after all.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks a lot Jon for the great article :-)<br>
<p>
Part of me feels that this is _too much policy_ leaking into the kernel code. I guess the Facebook approach of relegating this to user-space makes more sense?<br>

Maybe something similar can be done in systemd (systemd-oomd?), with its standardized user-space configuration options instead of all of these policy decisions and tunables  ..<br>

I think making it aware of the groups for this kind of scheduling isn't too much policy.  Since the cgroups can affect everything else the kernel does with them (scheduling, io, etc.) it makes sense to extend it to this.  And adding the "kill the whole group" bit makes administration easier, have your container all in one cgroup and just let the oom killer take the whole thing out and then your infrastructure restarts it.  No need for a complicated heartbeat or other more likely to fail signal saying this container isn't functioning properly anymore.  That said, anything beyond making it aware of these structures I think does make sense to put into something userspace.  Not sure how facebook's setup works but I could see something that's dynamically adjusting the oom scores to try to keep certain things from being killed while encouraging others and that's going to be a much more complicated policy since it'll be system/service/etc. specific.<br>

Yeah, I really like the "kill the whole cgroup" option too (memory.oom_group).<br>
<p>
It makes sense especially since systemd puts each "service" in its its own cgroup, and killing the whole service sounds much more graceful than picking a single victim process from within it.<br>

Depends on the service really, what I often see is that there is a main process that fork()s into multiple children and some of the child processes grow out of control. Although this may be handled better within the cgroup? <br>

I don't think killing all the processes in the cgroup makes anything appreciably easier. Since any of the processes could crash in some other way, you still need whatever monitoring mechanisms you had before.<br>

Obviously.<br>
<p>
But if a control group happens to represent a container, the processes belonging to it will usually be cooperating more closely than unrelated, other processes also running on the same system. Hence, killing one process running inside a container will end up as more or less drastically malfunctioning virtual server while killing all of them would be more like a clean shutdown. I certainly prefer the latter of the former.<br>
<p>
There's also another issue: Assuming the OOM situation was caused by some software bug/ malfunction, chances are that it will happen again fairly quickly as the "monitoring infrastructure" will seek to reestablish the problematic state. Killing everything in the cgroup should prevent that from happening.<br>

How does this related to cgroups with the memory controller? Isn't oom killer also invoked when the cgroups memory limit is hit? Can then"kill the whole cgroup" not also be implemented in the cgroup itself by installing an cgroup oom notification listener?<br>

Would that mean that a cgroup could ignore an oom notification?<br>

AFAIU this is not about cgroups memory limit, but a system-wide OOM in a situation where there are cgroups. There might be per-cgroup limits, but it's not that the sum of these limits would equal the system memory, because that would lead to underutilized system. So instead there's overcommit and the workloads can tolerate being killed on the level of a whole group.<br>

Well, this is not entirely true. There were quite serious concerns about the<br>
proposed API allowing for weird corner cases. E.g.<br>
<a href="http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180130085013.GP21609@dhcp22.suse.cz">http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180130085013.GP21609@dhcp22.su...</a>. The<br>
discussion circled in some repetitive arguments so it is not really easy to<br>
follow up, unfortunately. The last version hasn't been reviewed AFAIK but bases<br>
are quite similar so I am skeptical this is mergeable anytime soon.<br>
<p>
The biggest quarrel about this whole thing is a different view about feature<br>
completeness IMHO.<br>
<p>
While the original Roman's proposal was targeting very specific class of<br>
usecases (containers as you've mentioned) and it was an opt-in so those<br>
uninterested could live with the original policy/heuristic with potential<br>
extensions[1] to be done on top.<br>
<p>
David was pushing hard for a more generic solution which would give a bigger<br>
power over the oom selection policy to userspace. While this is a good thing<br>
in general, the primary problem is that this is extremely hard to get right.<br>
We have been discussing this for years without finding moving forward much<br>
because opinions of what is really important vary a lot.<br>
<p>
[1] group_oom makes a lot of sense regardless of the oom victim selection<br>
policy because some workloads are inherently indivisible<br>

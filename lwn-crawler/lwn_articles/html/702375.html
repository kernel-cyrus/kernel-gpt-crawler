<h1>Creating a kernel build farm</h1>

Willy Tarreau, known for his maintenance of extra-long-term stable kernels
among other things, is not often seen at Linux events.  Attendees at Kernel
Recipes 2016 thus got a rare opportunity when Willy discussed his work on
the creation of build farms for the kernel (or any other large software
project).  Not every developer needs a build farm, but those who do a lot
of backports, must frequently bisect to find problems, have slow laptops,
or maintain a large body of code will find that a dedicated build 
infrastructure can save a lot of time.
<p>
Maintaining a stable kernel can require doing a lot of backports, which is
not trivial work.  There are API changes to contend with, and backported
patches can
often cause build or boot failures.  Thus, every backported patch must be
independently validated.  This process takes a lot of time in general, and
kernel build time tends to dominate the rest.  It takes 45&nbsp;minutes to
do an allmodconfig build on his laptop, for example.  So he will often
start a build and go for lunch — only to discover that the build failed
shortly after he left and must be restarted from the beginning.
<p>
Developers like Willy thus clearly have an interest in reducing the amount
of time they spend waiting for builds.  One way to do that would to stop
testing backports but, he allowed, that may not be the best of ideas.  He
could simply buy a bigger machine but, beyond the financial issues, a
large build machine is not something that he can carry around with him.
One can use tools like <a href="https://ccache.samba.org/">ccache</a>, but
it tends to not work well when include files are changed, which is a common
occurrence in backporting work.  An option that does have promise, though,
is distributing the build work across multiple machines.

<h4>Software issues</h4>
<p>
Not every task is suitable for a build farm, he said; one has to start
with a workload that is readily distributable.  So the project's build
system must support parallel builds; a surprising number of projects don't
support that.  The project should be large, with many more source files
than machines to build them on, and the compile time for each file should
be approximately equal.  The kernel, as it happens, fits this pattern well.
<p>
Needless to say, a developer needs to have multiple machines available to
run the build farm on.  Importantly, each machine needs to be running the
exact same compiler, or problems will result later on.  The only reliable way to get
there, he said, is to build the compiler yourself.  It is a scary process,
but it's actually not that hard.  <a
href="http://crosstool-ng.org/">Crosstool-NG</a> is good for this task; it
can also do

"<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler#Canadian_Cross">Canadian
cross-compiler builds</a>" (using an x86 machine to create an ARM-native
compiler that does x86 compiles, for example) that can be useful for some
kinds of build farms.
<p>
Also needed is a way to submit jobs to machines — a distributed build
controller.  This system needs to be unintrusive, not requiring patches to
the system being built; it should also have little overhead "or you lose."
A good build controller can work with cross compilers, and it should be
able to fall back to the local node when dependency issues get in the way
of remote builds.  The ability to work around unreachable machines is
important; machines must be able to drop out of the build farm without
stopping everything.
<p>
The right tool for this job is <a
href="https://github.com/distcc">distcc</a>.  It can work as a wrapper, or
in "masqueraded mode," where distcc uses the name by which it was invoked
to find the real compiler on the remote systems.  It requires no daemons on
the build systems, can implement per-node usage limits, is able to avoid
using unresponsive machines, and more.  There are a few stumbling blocks
when one uses distcc with the kernel; it will not use the remote machines
if <tt>gcov</tt> code coverage tracking is enabled, for example, so one
must ensure that <tt>CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL</tt> is turned off.  One should
also remember that the preprocessing and final linking steps are done on
the local node; they take 20-30% of the total time and, as a result, place
a lower bound on how fast the build can ever be.
<p>
<h4>The hardware side</h4>
<p>
Software is important for the creation of a build farm but, obviously, one
will not get far without hardware to build on.  Much of the rest of the
talk was dedicated to the process of picking machines for the farm.  To
start, he said, it's important to know what is being optimized for.  Some
developers want the highest performance they can get for a given cost;
others will want to minimize the number of nodes, the power consumption, or
the noise created by the farm.  Different needs will lead to different
choices.
<p>
When comparing machine performance, Willy said, it is important to always
use the same project for build testing.  In the end, the metric that
matters is lines compiled per second, so that is what should be measured.
Make sure that the CPU frequency governor is set for performance ("make the
planet warmer," he said) as the powersave mode often used on laptops can
slow the build considerably.  One should make multiple runs, looking for at
least three with consistent results.
<p>
What affects the performance of a build node?  The CPU architecture and
frequency matter, of course; the recent Intel and AMD processors, he said,
are impressive.  Memory latency matters, as do the size and latency of the
CPU caches.  Storage speed will have an effect on performance.  The options
used to build the compiler can also have up to a 10% effect on performance;

<a href="/Articles/702381/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/recipes/WillyTarreau-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
alt="[Willy Tarreau]" title="Willy Tarreau" border=0 hspace=3 vspace=3
align="right"></a> 

playing with crosstool-NG to get the best configuration is recommended.  In
the end, he has found DRAM latency to be the single most important factor
affecting a machine's build performance, followed by cache latency, CPU
frequency, and core counts, in that order.  If the system is held back by
its DRAM performance, adding CPUs will not help the situation.
<p>
To get the best performance, one should ensure that the build systems run
at 100% CPU utilization — except the local node, which should not be
heavily loaded. 
Distributed builds create a lot of network traffic; the network must not be
saturated or things will slow down.  All of the memory channels should be
used; a PC with a single memory stick in it will not perform well.
Enabling hyperthreading can give a 50% performance gain, and overclocking can
be worth looking into, depending on the system involved.  There
is no point in having more than eight cores, there won't be enough memory
bandwidth to keep them busy.  In general, he said, machines
designed for gamers are the best; they are not hugely expensive and are
built to be tweakable.
<p>
If one is optimizing for a low number of nodes, one obviously wants the
highest performance possible per node.  Willy suggests using dual-socket,
eight-core machines with all memory slots populated.  Such a machine will
have a huge memory bandwidth and will perform well.  It will also be big,
power-hungry, and noisy.
<p>
<h4>Going small</h4>
<p>
One could, instead, optimize for hardware cost.  A <a
href="http://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=132">NanoPi
NEO</a> system can be had for $8; it is a quad-core, 1.2&nbsp;GHz machine.
It actually works, though it is about 1/16 the power of a PC, and gets even
slower when thermal throttling kicks in.  This machine is limited by its
100MB/sec Ethernet, though.  By the time one figures in the additional
costs — shipping, switch ports, network cables, SD cards, USB power
supplies, etc. — the cost starts to go up.  As a whole, this approach is
not entirely interesting.
<p>
One can do a bit better with mid-range machines like the <a
href="http://nanopi.io/nanopi2-fire.html">NanoPi&nbsp;2 Fire</a> or the <a
href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php">ODROID
C2</a>.  These machines run $25-60; they offer good performance density and
reasonable cooling.  On the other hand, the per-board cost is high, some
can run hot, and some of them require special kernels to operate.
<p>
At the high end (of cheaper hardware), there are devices like the <a
href="https://forum.mqmaker.com/t/announcing-miqi-a-credit-card-sized-computer/371">MiQi</a>,
the RKM v5, or the CS&nbsp;008.  These are often sold as "set-top boxes" in
the $50-200 range.  They can offer 4-8 ARM A17 or A53 cores, making them
relatively powerful boards with 1/4 the performance of a basic PC.  Some of
them offer gigabit Ethernet and onboard storage; some even have mainline
kernel support.  On the other hand, they often are sold running Android,
and can be of varying build quality.  Power consumption can be higher than
advertised.  They are subject to thermal throttling; he said to never buy
such a board if it does not have a heat sink installed.  The MiQi has
become his favorite in this area.
<p>
To prove the point, Willy pulled out his MiQi-based build farm,
consisting of four MiQi boards, a small Ethernet switch, and a USB power
supply, from a small
box in his backpack, and proceeded to build a kernel with it.  The process
takes less than 15 minutes "when it works."
<p>
He concluded by mentioning a few "future research" ideas, starting with
playing with the <a
href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2008/08/distccs-pump-mode-new-design-for.html">distcc
pump mode</a>.  He would like to experiment with putting <a
href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> in front of distcc; in his
experience, the loads are not always well balanced across the build
machines now.  Build farms could be smaller and cheaper if they could be
built without an Ethernet switch.  WiFi is not up to the traffic demands
and cannot be used, though; he wants to try USB networking instead.
<p>
As the talk wound down, an audience member asked about distribution
recommendations.  Willy responded that pretty much any distribution can be
made to work in this role.  In fact, the Android-based boards can even
support this work, but only if the SELinux configuration is not so
restrictive that it gets in the way.

Preprocessing can be distributed if the other build systems are completely identical.

<p>
Section "Restrictions for Pump Mode" does say,<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The incremental include analysis of distc-pump mode rests on the fundamental assumption that source and header files do not change during the build process. A few complex build systems, such as that for Linux kernel 2.6, do not quite satisfy this requirement. To overcome such issues, and other corner cases such as absolute filepaths in includes, see the include_server(1) man page.</font><br>

I guess a Pi Zero will be too limited, but you can certainly cluster a bunch of them inexpensively. For example, check out the Cluster Hat (<a href="http://clusterhat.com/">http://clusterhat.com/</a>). I could picture something similar as a pure backplane, with power control implemented via the USB hub itself, connected to a host via eg. a USB 3 hub.<br>
<p>
512MB is probably too small to be effective as a compiler, though, I suppose.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 7, 2008</br>
           </div>
All communities develop rituals over time.  One of the enduring
linux-kernel rituals is the regular heated discussion on development
processes and kernel quality.  To an outside observer, these events
can give the impression that the whole enterprise is about to come crashing
down.  But the reality is a lot like the New Year celebrations your editor
was privileged enough to see in Beijing: vast amounts of smoke and noise,
but everybody gets back to work as usual the next day.
<p>
Beyond that, though, discussions of this nature have real value.  Any group
which is concerned about issues like quality must, on occasion, take a step
back and evaluate the situation.  Even if there are no immediate outcomes,
the ideas raised often reverberate over the following months, sometimes
leading to real improvements.
<p>

The immediate inspiration for this round of discussion was broken systems
resulting from the 2.6.26 merge window.  This development cycle has had a
rougher start than some, with more than the usual number of patches causing
boot failures and other sorts of inconvenient behavior.  That led to some
back-and-forth between developers on how patches should be handled.  Broken
patches are unfortunate, but one thing is worth noting here: these problems
were caught and fixed even before the 2.6.26-rc1 kernel release was made.
The problems which set off this round of discussion are not bugs which will
affect Linux users.
<p>

But, beyond any doubt, there will be other bugs which are slower to surface
and slower to be fixed.  The number of these bugs has led to a number of
calls to slow down the development process in one way or another.  To that
end, it is worth noting that the process <i>has</i> slowed down somewhat,
with the 2.6.26 merge window bringing in far fewer changesets than were
seen for 2.6.24 or 2.6.25.  Whether this slower pace will continue into
future development cycles, or whether it's simply a lull after two
exceptionally busy cycles remains to be seen.
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>

But, if the process does not slow down on its own, there are developers who
would like to find a way to force it to happen.  Some have argued for
simply throttling the process by, for example, limiting new features in
each development cycle to specific subsystems of the kernel.  There has
also been talk of picking the subsystems with the worst regression counts
and excluding new features from those subsystems until things improve.  The
fact of the matter, though, is that throttling is unlikely to help the
situation.  
<p>

Slowing down merging does not keep developers from developing, it just
keeps their code out of the tree.  An extreme example can be found in the
2.4 kernel: the merging of new code was heavily throttled for a long time.
What happened was that the distributors started merging new developments
themselves because their users were demanding them.  So a lot of kernels
which went under the name "2.4" were far removed from anything which could
be downloaded from kernel.org.  That way lies fragmentation - and almost
certainly lower quality as well.
<p>

Linus actually <a href="/Articles/281122/">takes this argument</a> further
by arguing that quickly merging patches leads to better quality:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 [M]y personal belief is that the best way to raise quality of code
	 is to distribute it. Yes, as patches for discussion, but even more
	 so as a part of a cohesive whole - as _merged_ patches!
<p>
	 The thing is, the quality of individual patches isn't what
	 matters! What matters is the quality of the end result. And people
	 are going to be a lot more involved in looking at, testing, and
	 working with code that is merged, rather than code that isn't.
</div>
<p>
 
Andrew Morton has also <a href="/Articles/281125/">argued against
throttling</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If we simply throttled things, people would spend more time
	watching the shopping channel while merging smaller amounts of the
	same old crap.
</div>
<p>
Kernel developers are, of course, known to be hard-core shoppers, so giving
them more opportunity to pursue that activity is probably not the best
idea.  Seriously, though: Andrew is in favor of a slower development
process, but only when approached from a different angle: his point is that
an increased focus on quality will, as a side effect, result in slower
development.  Kernel developers need to be focused on finding and fixing
bugs rather than creating new ones and/or shopping.
<p>

It is worth noting that a substantial portion of the development community
appears to believe that there are no real problems in this regard.  Bugs
are being found and fixed at a high rate and the kernel is solid for most
users.  Arjan van de Ven <a href="/Articles/281129/">notes</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Are we doing worse on quality? My (subjective) opinion is that we
	are doing better than last year.  We are focused more on
	quality. We are fixing the bugs that people hit most. We are fixing
	most of the regressions (yes, not all). Subsystems are seeing flat
	or lower bugcounts/bugrates.
</div>
<p>
Ted Ts'o <a href="/Articles/281131/">points out</a> that a lot of problems
result from obscure and low-quality hardware, and that it's not possible to
make everybody happy.  Andrew is <a
href="/Articles/281132/">unconvinced</a>, though, and seems to fear that
the kernel is declining in quality.
<p>

In a sense, though, that part of the discussion is moot.  Nobody would
argue against the idea that fewer bugs is a worthy goal, regardless of whether one believes
that the current process has quality problems.  So talk of ways to make
things better is always on-topic.
<p>

Testing remains a big issue; the kernel, more than almost any other
project, is highly sensitive to the systems on which it is run.  Many
problems (arguably the majority of them) are related to specific hardware,
or specific combinations of hardware; there is no way for the developers,
who do not have all possible hardware to test on, to ever find all of these
bugs.  Users have to help with that process.  Getting widespread testing
coverage is always hard; Peter Anvin <a href="/Articles/281133/">argues</a>
that the current process has actually made that harder:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	One thing is that we keep fragmenting the tester base by adding new
	confidence levels: we now have -mm, -next, mainline -git, mainline
	-rc, mainline release, stable, distro testing, and distro release
	(and some distros even have aggressive versus conservative tracks.)
	Furthermore, thanks to craniorectal immersion on the part of
	graphics vendors, a lot of users have to run proprietary drivers on
	their "main work" systems, which means they can't even test newer
	releases even if they would dare.
</div>
<p>
There is, in fact, a wealth of development kernels to test, and it is not
always clear where users and developers should be concentrating their
testing effort.  A consensus may be forming, though, that more people
should be looking at the linux-next tree in particular.  Linux-next is
where all of the patches intended for the next merge window are supposed to
congregate; the current contents of linux-next, as of this writing, are
targeted toward 2.6.27.  This is the place where early integration issues
and other problems should be found; if linux-next is well tested, the
number of problems showing up in the next merge window should be somewhat
reduced. 
<p>

The linux-next tree is an interesting experiment.  It is, for all practical
purposes, making the development cycle longer: since linux-next exists, the
2.6.27 cycle has, in some sense, already started.  Linux-next also does
something which kernel developers have tended to resist: causing the
stabilization period for one development cycle to overlap with active
development for the next cycle.  In the past, it has been argued that this
kind of overlap will cause developers to prioritize the creation of new
toys over fixing the problems with last week's toys. 
<p>

Some people argue that this is happening now: developers are not
spending enough time dealing with bugs - and that their carelessness is
creating too many bugs in the first place.  Others assert that, while it will
never be possible to fix every reported bug, the bugs that really matter
are being addressed.  A real resolution to this disagreement seems
unlikely; the creation of meaningful metrics on kernel quality is a
difficult task.  About the best that can be done is to try to keep the
regression list as small as possible; as long as systems which once worked
continue to work, it is hard to argue too forcefully that things are headed
in the wrong direction.

Basically we reached or are about to reach 10.000.000 lines of highly critical C code. 
Metrics are difficult, bugs appears, the world in chaos. 
If the thing is still going on at a fast speed and with relatively few bugs is by a brute
force method of having tons of eyes and hands on the code. 

Clearly, even with kernel's increasently good management and new tactics to aliviate it, it is
not a good prospect, in some years we will have twice the code size, etc. 

I don't know what would be a nice solution to this situation, maybe limiting the functions
drivers can use. And kernel assuming drivers can fail. So driver's code can not work but will
not make the kernel crash (drivers is most of the code)

I'm curious what the stats are of code with the drivers removed.  Code growth through drivers
and archs that 95% people of people won't run in their kernel isn't that interesting.

I have a vague feeling (without proof) that the core kernel sans drivers is not growing that
dramatically.  Subsystems already have their own maintainers and review systems.

Scaling then happens with the splitting into subsystems and driver maintainers, etc.  So not
actually a problem in the longer term, even though total LoC churn would be very high.

The kernel code is growing in an exact proportion to the amount it contains within the kernel
itself.

So, for example, the core kernel makes up 5% of the overall size.
And exactly 5% of the changes happen in the core kernel code itself.

Same goes for every other category of the kernel code, it's pretty amazing.

I have a script that digs all of these numbers out of the changelogs on my kernel.org
directory for these kinds of statistics.

This is a dangerous attitude.  Bugs are bad.  Reported but unfixed bugs have a nasty tendency
to have security implications.  Unreported bugs are the ones that should really frighten ya.

Eventually a policy needs to be enforced that only very well reviewed code goes in.  Obviously
that won't work for device drivers since they continually churn.

      <P>Not all bug reports describe kernel bugs.  Sometimes faulty hardware is the cause.  So, while it might be fair to say "all bugs are bad," it's not fair to say "all bug reports represent an actual bug in the Linux kernel, and therefore must be fixed by changing the kernel."</P>

I should add, I did have a 486 system that was a poster child for the sig-11 FAQ, and I did
have a filesystem get hosed by a bitflip on a machine I built w/ 512MB RAM that wasn't ECC.
(The machine had nearly a year of uptime and not much load.  A bitflip on a disk buffer wasn't
actually all that unlikely.)

My current boxes all get ECC RAM now, and tons of extra cooling.

It's worthy to have less bugs. It's not worthy to just have less reported bugs. As long as
there are factors limiting testing (because the process is developer, not tester oriented) you
only have access to the second number, and can't really assess coder quality.

A better metric would IMHO be the mean time a bug gets to be fixed. If this time gets low
enough one could argue the bottleneck is no longer developers but testers.

I'd hope that <i>everyone</i> would argue that :)

Maybe they could start tracking bugs in some kind of distributed way, just like the source
code is tracked. Imagine if users could add bug reports to the git tree under the commit they
were using and push them upstream, that would be really cool...

What makes much more sense is to change the bugzilla so that you do not have to register,
something along the lines of Debian-BTS. But wait, we have the mailing list for people who
prefer being in control of their subscription/registration.

      I'm just learning git and I noticed <a href="http://github.com/schacon/ticgit/wikis">ticgit</a> which puts issue tracking into the git repository itself.  Would that work?

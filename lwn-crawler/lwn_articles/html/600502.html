           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 4, 2014</br>
           </div>
The kernel has long supported the concept of locking pages into physical
memory; the <tt>mlock()</tt> system call is one way to accomplish that.
But it turns out that there is more than one way to fix memory in place,
and some of those ways have to behave differently than others.  The result
is confusion with resource accounting and suboptimal memory-management behavior
in current 
kernels.  A patch set from Peter Zijlstra may soon straighten things out by
formalizing a second type of page locking under the name "pinning."
<p>
One of the problems with memory locking is that it doesn't quite meet the
needs of all users.
A page that has been locked into memory with a call like <tt>mlock()</tt>
is required to always be physically present in the system's RAM.  At a
superficial level, locked pages should thus never cause a page fault when
accessed by an application.  But there is nothing that requires a locked
page to always be present in the same place; the kernel is free to move a
locked page if the need arises.  Migrating a page will cause a soft page
fault (one that is resolved without any I/O) the next time an application
tries to access that page.  Most of the time, that is not a problem, but
developers of hard real-time applications go far out of their way to avoid
even the small amount of latency caused by a soft fault.  These developers
would like a firmer form of locking that is guaranteed to never cause page
faults.  The kernel does not currently provide that level of memory locking.
<p>
Locking also fails to meet the needs of various in-kernel users.  In
particular, kernel code that uses a range of memory as a DMA buffer needs
to know that said memory will not be moved.  As a result, the locking
mechanism has never been used for these pages; instead, they are fixed in
place by incrementing their reference counts or through a call to
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>.  Such pages are effectively fixed in place,
though there is no way for the kernel to know that they may be nailed down
for a long time.
<p>
There is an interesting question that arises with these informally locked
pages, 
though: how do they interact with the resource limit mechanism?  The kernel
allows an administrator to place an upper bound on the number of pages that
a user is able to lock into memory.  But, in some cases, the creation of a
DMA buffer shared with user space is the result of an application's
request.  So users can, for all practical purposes, lock pages in memory
via actions like the creation of remote DMA (RDMA) buffers; those pages are not
currently counted against the limit on locked pages.  This irritates
administrators and developers who want the limit on locked pages to apply
to <i>all</i> locked pages, not just some of them.
<p>
These "back door" locked pages also create another sort of problem.
Normally, the memory management subsystem goes out of its way to separate
pages that can be moved from those that are fixed in place.  But, in this
case, the pages are often allocated as normal anonymous memory — movable
pages, in other words.  Fixing them in place makes them unmovable.  At that
point, they will be in the way any time the memory management code tries to
create contiguous ranges of memory by shifting pages around; they are in a
place reserved for 
movable pages, but, being unmovable, they cannot be moved out of the way
to make the creation of larger blocks possible.
<p>
Peter's <a href="/Articles/600338/">patch set</a> tries to address all of
these problems — or, at least, to show how they could be addressed.  It
creates a formal notion of a "pinned" page, being a page that must remain
in memory at its current physical location.  Pinned pages are kept in a
separate virtual memory area (VMA), which is marked with the
<tt>VM_PINNED</tt> flag.  Within the kernel, pages can be pinned with the
new <tt>mm_mpin()</tt> function:
<p>
<pre>
    int mm_mpin(unsigned long start, size_t len);
</pre>
<p>
This function will pin the pages in memory, but only if the calling
process's resource limits allow it.  Kernel code that needs to access the
pinned memory directly will still need to call <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>,
of course; that call should be done after the call to <tt>mm_mpin()</tt>.
<p>
One of the longer-term goals (not part of this patch set) is to make this
memory-pinning functionality available to user space.  A new
<tt>mpin()</tt> system call would function like <tt>mlock()</tt>, but with
the additional guarantee that the page would never be moved and, thus,
would never generate page faults on access.  Adding this functionality
would mostly appear to be a matter of setting up the system call plumbing. 
<p>
Another currently unimplemented feature is the migration of the pages to be
pinned prior to nailing them down.  The <tt>mm_mpin()</tt> call makes it
clear that the pages involved 
will not be movable in the near future.  It would thus make sense
for the kernel to shift them out of a movable zone (if that is where they
are currently located) and into one of the
ranges of memory reserved for non-movable pages.  That would prevent pinned
pages from interfering with memory compaction and, thus, would facilitate
the creation of larger blocks of free memory in those pages' original
location. 
<p>
Finally, putting pinned pages under their own VMA makes it relatively easy
to keep track of them.  So pinned pages can be counted against the
locked-pages limit, eliminating that particular loophole.
<p>
Thus far, nobody seems to be overly bothered by this patch set.  In
previous discussions, there have been concerns that changing the accounting
of locked pages could cause regressions on some systems where users are
running close to their limits.  There are few ways around that problem,
though; one could continue to leave pinned pages out of the equation or,
perhaps, create a separate limit for them.  Neither option has a great deal
of appeal, so it may just be that this change will go through as-is.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

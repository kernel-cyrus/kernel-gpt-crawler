<p>
Recently, the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/792733/">DMA-BUF heaps
interface</a> was added to the 5.6 kernel.  This
interface is similar to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/480055/">ION</a>,
which has been 
used for years by Android vendors. However, in trying to move vendors to
use DMA-BUF heaps, we have begun to see how the DMA API model
doesn't fit well for modern mobile devices.  Additionally, the lack of clear
guidance in how to handle cache operations efficiently, results in vendors
using custom device-specific optimizations that aren't generic enough for
an upstream solution.  This article will describe the nature of the
problem; the upcoming second installment will look at the path toward a
solution.

<p>
The kernel's DMA APIs are all provided for the sharing of memory between the
CPU and devices.  The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt">traditional
DMA API</a> has, in recent years, been joined by additional interfaces such
as ION, <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.6/driver-api/dma-buf.html">DMA-BUF</a>,
and DMA-BUF heaps.  But, as we will see, the problem of
efficiently supporting memory sharing is not yet fully solved.

<p>
As an interface, ION was poorly specified, allowing
applications to pass custom, opaque flags and arguments to vendor-specific,
out-of-tree heap implementations. Additionally, since the users of these
interfaces only ran on the vendors' devices
with their custom kernel implementations, little attention was paid to trying to
create useful generic interfaces. So multiple vendors might use the same
heap ID for different purposes, or they might implement
the same heap functionality but using different heap IDs and flag
options. Even worse, many vendors drastically
changed the ION interface and implementation itself, so that there was
little in common between vendor ION implementations other than their name and
basic functionality. ION essentially became a playground for out-of-tree
and device-specific vendor hacks.
<p>
Meanwhile, the general
dislike of the interface upstream meant that objections to the API often
obfuscated the deeper problems that vendors were using ION to solve. But
now that the 
DMA-BUF heaps interface is upstream, some vendors are trying to migrate
from their ION heap implementations (and, hopefully, submit
the result upstream). In doing so, they are starting to wonder how they will
implement some of the functionality and optimizations they were able to obtain
with ION while using the more constrained DMA-BUF heaps interface.
<p>
A side effect of trying to cajole vendors into pushing their heap
functionality upstream is learning more about the details and complexities
of how vendors use DMA-BUFs. Since performance is important to mobile
vendors, they spend lots of time and effort optimizing how data moves
through the device. Specifically, they use buffer sharing not just for
moving data 
between the CPU and a device, but for sharing data between
different devices in a pipeline. Often, data is generated by one
device, then processed by multiple other devices without
the CPU ever accessing it.
<p>

For example, a camera sensor may capture raw data to a buffer; that buffer
is then passed to an image signal processor (ISP), which applies a set of
corrections and adjustments. The ISP will generate one buffer that is
passed directly to the display compositor and rendered directly to the
screen.  The ISP also produces a second buffer that is converted by an
encoder to produce yet another buffer that can then be passed to a
neural-network engine for face detection (which is then used for focus
correction on future frames).

<p>
This model of multi-device buffer sharing is
common in mobile systems, but isn't as common upstream, and it exposes
some limitations of the existing DMA API — particularly when it comes to
cache handling.  Note that while both the CPU and devices can have their
own caches, in this article I'm
specifically focusing on the CPU cache; device caches are left to be
handled by their respective device drivers.
<p>
<h4>The DMA API</h4>
<p>
When we look at the existing DMA API, we see that it implements
a clear model that handles memory sharing between the CPU and a single
device. The DMA API is particularly careful about how "ownership" — with
respect to the CPU cache — of a buffer
is handled, in order to avoid data corruption. By
default, memory is considered part of the CPU's
virtual memory space and the CPU is the de-facto owner of it. It is assumed
that
the CPU may read and write the memory freely; it is only when allowing
a device to do a DMA transaction on the memory that the ownership of the
memory is passed to the device.
<p>
The DMA API describes two types of memory architecture, called "consistent"
and "non-consistent" (or sometimes "coherent" and "non-coherent"). With
consistent-memory architectures, changes to 
memory contents (even when done by a device) will cause any cached data
to be updated or invalidated.  As a result, a device
or CPU can read memory immediately after a device or CPU writes to
it without having to worry about caching effects (though the
DMA API notes that the CPU cache may need to be flushed before devices
can read). Much of the x86 world deals with consistent memory (with some
exceptions, usually dealing with GPUs), however in the Arm world, we
see many devices that are not coherent with the CPU and are thus
non-consistent-memory architectures. That said, as Arm64 devices gain
functionality like PCIe, there can often be a mix of coherent and
non-coherent devices on a system.
<p>
With non-consistent memory, additional care has to be taken to properly
handle the cache state of the CPU to avoid corrupting data.

If the DMA API's ownership rules are not followed, the device could write
to memory without the CPU's knowledge; that could cause the CPU to use
stale data in its cache.

Similarly, the CPU could flush stale data from its cache to
overwrite the newly device-written memory.  Data corruption is likely to
result either way.
<p>
<div class="tlr">
If you're interested in learning more, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n07zPcbdX_w">Laurent Pinchart's ELC
2014 presentation on the DMA API</a> is great; 
<a
href="https://elinux.org/images/3/32/Pinchart--mastering_the_dma_and_iommu_apis.pdf">the
slides [PDF]</a> are also available.
</div>


Thus, the DMA API rules help establish proper cache handling in a generic
fashion, ensuring that the CPU cache is invalidated if the device is 
writing to the memory and flushed before the device reads the memory.
Normally, these cache operations are
done when the buffer ownership is transferred between the CPU and the device,
such as when the memory is mapped and then unmapped from the
DMA device (via functions like <tt>dma_map_single()</tt>).
<p>

From the DMA API perspective, sharing buffers with multiple devices is the
same as sharing with a single device, except that the sharing is done in a
series of discrete operations. The CPU allocates a buffer, then
passes ownership of that buffer to the first device (potentially flushing
the CPU cache).  The CPU then allows the device to do the 
DMA and unmaps the buffer (potentially invalidating the CPU cache) when the
operation is complete,
bringing the ownership back to the CPU. Then the process is repeated for
the next device and the device after.
<p>
The problem here is that those cache operations add up, especially when the
CPU isn't actually touching the buffer in between. Ideally,
if we were sharing the buffer with a series of cache-incoherent
devices, the CPU cache would be initially flushed, then the buffer could be
used by devices in series without additional cache operations. The
DMA API does allow for some flexibility here, so there are ways to have
mapping operations skip CPU syncing; there are also the
<tt>dma_sync_*_for_cpu/device()</tt> calls which allow explicit cache
operations to be done while there is an existing mapping. But these
are "expert-only" tools
provided without much guidance, and they trust that drivers take special
care when using these optimizations.
<p>
<h4>DMA-BUFs</h4>
<p>
DMA-BUFs were
introduced to provide a generic way for applications and drivers to share a
handle to a memory buffer. The
DMA-BUFs themselves are created by a DMA-BUF exporter, which is a driver
that can allocate a specific type of memory but that also provides hooks
to handle mapping and unmapping the buffer in various ways
for the kernel, user space, or devices.
<p>
The general usage flow of DMA-BUFs for a device is as follows (see the
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.7/source/include/linux/dma-buf.h#L29"><tt>dma_buf_ops</tt>
structure</a> for more details): 
<p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>dma_buf_attach()</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Attaches the buffer to a device (that will use the
	buffer in the future). The exporter can try to move the buffer if
	needed to make it accessible to the new device or return an
	error. The buffer can be attached to multiple devices.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>dma_buf_map_attachment()</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Maps the buffer into an attached device's address
	space. The buffer can be mapped by multiple attachments.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>dma_buf_unmap_attachment()</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Unmaps the buffer from the attached device's
	address space.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>dma_buf_detach()</tt></dt>
<dd>
	Signals that the device is finished with the buffer; the
	exporter can do whatever cleanup it needs.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
If we were looking at this from the classic DMA API perspective, we would
consider a DMA-BUF to be normally owned by the CPU. Only when 
<tt>dma_buf_map_attachment()</tt> was called would the buffer ownership
transfer  to the device
(with the 
associated cache flushing). Then on
<tt>dma_buf_unmap_attachment()</tt>, the buffer would be unmapped and ownership
would return to the CPU (again with the proper cache invalidation
required). This in effect would make the DMA-BUF exporter the entity
responsible for complying with the DMA API rules of ownership.
<p>
The trouble with this scheme arises with a buffer pipeline consisting of a
number of devices, where the CPU doesn't actually touch the buffer.
Following the DMA API and calling <tt>dma_map_sg()</tt> and
<tt>dma_unmap_sg()</tt> on each 
<tt>dma_buf_map_attachment()</tt> and <tt>dma_buf_unmap_attachment()</tt>
call results in 
lots of cache-maintenance operations, which dramatically impacts
performance. This was viscerally felt by ION users after a cleanup series
landed in 4.12 that caused ION to use the DMA API properly. Previously,
it had lots of hacks and was not compliant with the DMA API,
resulting in buffer corruption in some cases;
see <a
href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.net/2014/ocw/system/presentations/2409/original/04%20-%20iondma_foreview_v2.pdf">the
slides from Laura Abbott’s presentation</a> for more details.
This compliance cleanup caused a dramatic performance drop for ION users,
which resulted in some vendors reverting back to the 4.9 ION code in their
4.14-based products, and others creating their own hacks to improve
performance.
 <p>
So how can we have DMA-BUF exporters that better align with the DMA API,
but do so with the performance needed for modern devices when using buffer
pipelines with multiple devices?

In the second part of this article, we will continue discussing some of the
unique semantics and flexibility in DMA-BUF that allows drivers to
potentially avoid this performance impact (by going somewhat "off-road"
from the DMA API usage guidelines), as well as the downsides of what that
flexibility allows. Finally, we'll share some thoughts as to how these
downsides might be avoided.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Nice writeup!<br>
<p>
Though there is one thing that doesn't seem obvious - <br>
<p>
"the buffer would be unmapped and ownership would return to the CPU (again with the proper cache invalidation required)"<br>
<p>
Why do the CPU caches needs to be invalidated when transferring the ownership of the buffer back from the device. One reason I could think of was due to speculative fetches but that shouldn't be the case if the buffer is not mapped. What am I missing?<br>

If I understand correctly, the buffer typically never gets unmapped from the CPU's page table, because that would be an unnecessary performance cost. On dma_map_*/dma_unmap_*, it just gets added to / removed from the device's IOMMU page table or equivalent (if there is one).<br>
<p>
Software on the CPU has to promise not to touch the buffer while the device is using it, else there will be unpredictable behaviour due to non-coherent caches. But the CPU hardware might read that memory anyway (prefetching, speculative execution, etc), so the CPU caches have to be invalidated after the device has stopped writing and before any software starts reading. That happens automatically when unmapped from the device, or can be done manually with the dma_sync_* APIs.<br>

Thanks for the explanation! Indeed skipping the memory unmap on CPU will save the cost of page table updates and tlb maintenance.<br>

My question here is, why does releasing ownership from a device implies CPU must acquire the ownership? Why can't we let ownership "float" briefly?  (If we are not sure CPU needs it, then don't let CPU acquire it and don't do cache operation on it).<br>

It shouldn't imply that (but presumably there are historical reasons why it does). The CPU shouldn't be so self-important - it's just one of many devices that might share access to some memory, many of which might have their own page tables and caches.<br>
<p>
Part 2 (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/822521/">https://lwn.net/Articles/822521/</a>) discusses some moves in that direction.<br>
<p>
I think ION already started from the extreme of that direction: its typical use case is e.g. to have the camera write an uncompressed video frame to memory, then pass it simultaneously to the video encoder and to the 3D graphics engine (which renders onto a framebuffer that then gets passed to the display hardware), then recycle the buffer once they have all finished with it. The CPU never touches the pixels. Often the pixels are stored in a proprietary cache-efficient tiled layout that makes it infeasible for the CPU to directly access the pixels at all. (When necessary for compatibility, the image can be copied and format-converted into a CPU-accessible format, but performance may be very bad). To replace ION, DMA-BUF has to support that kind of thing.<br>

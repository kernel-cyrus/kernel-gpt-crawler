<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 13, 2023</br>
           </div>
The <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html">kernel
samepage merging (KSM)</a> feature can save significant amounts of memory
with some types of workloads, but security concerns have greatly limited
its use.  Even when KSM can be safely enabled, though, the control interface
provided by the kernel makes it unlikely that KSM actually will be used.  A
small <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20230406165339.1017597-1-shr@devkernel.io/">patch
series</a> from Stefan Roesch aims to change this situation by improving
and simplifying how KSM is managed.
<p>
As its name would suggest, KSM works by finding pages of memory with
identical contents and merging them into a single copy that is shared by
all users.  An early use case, as <a href="/Articles/306704/">described by
Avi Kivity</a> in 2008 when the feature was first proposed, was "<q>the
typical multiuser gnome minicomputer with all 150 users reading lwn.net at
the same time instead of working</q>"; this workload would generate a lot
of identical cache pages that could be shared rather than duplicated across
the system.  There are other use cases, such as virtual machines or
containers running the same software, that could also be optimized once the
important workloads have been addressed.
<p>
There can be value in performing this kind of deduplication.  Some
workloads, it turns out, produce a lot of identical pages; merging those
pages cuts the memory use of those workloads considerably, allowing more
work to be crammed into the system.  KSM thus looked appealing.  The
merging of this feature <a href="/Articles/330589/">was delayed</a> for
some time as the result of security and patent concerns, but it finally
made it into the 2.6.32 release at the end of 2009.  It turns out, though,
that there were more security problems inherent in this mechanism than had
been originally thought.

<p>
KSM works by scanning pages in memory to locate pages with the same
contents.  When such pages are found, all users are made to share a single
copy of that page, while the duplicate copies are returned to the system's
free list.  Some care must be taken, though: KSM works with anonymous pages
(file-backed pages are already shared via the page cache), and the owners
of those pages can change their contents at any time.  One process's change
should, clearly, not affect any other processes that might be sharing that
page.  To ensure correct behavior, the kernel marks shared pages as
read-only; should a process write to such a page, a copy-on-write (COW)
operation will be performed to give the writing process its own copy again.
With this mechanism in place, pages can be safely shared between processes
that do not trust each other, with those processes being entirely unaware
of the tricks going on behind their back.
<p>
At least, that was the intent.  A write to an exclusively owned page is a
fast operation, while a write to a read-only page that forces a COW
operation takes quite a bit longer.  A hostile process can use this timing
difference to determine whether a page had been shared by the kernel or
not; that, in turn, allows the attacker to determine whether a page with
specific contents exists in the system.  Given enough time, these timing
attacks can be used to find out whether a specific program is running on
the system, determine another process's address-space layout randomization
offsets, or even exfiltrate cryptographic keys.
<p>
The security concerns associated with KSM are sufficiently worrying that
the feature is not generally enabled.  The only way to turn it on is for a
process that wishes to participate in sharing to make an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
call (<tt>MADV_MERGEABLE</tt>) to enable KSM for a specific memory range.
Few programs do this, so KSM is not widely used.  As Roesch notes in the
cover letter, even developers who are aware of KSM and wish to enable it
may be unable to if they are working in a garbage-collected language that
does not provide access to <tt>madvise()</tt>.
<p>
The proposed solution to this problem is a new <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
operation (<tt>PR_SET_MEMORY_MERGE</tt>) that sets the KSM status for a
process as a whole.  If this operation is used to turn on KSM, every
virtual memory area (VMA) within the process that could be merged will have
KSM enabled, as will any eligible VMAs created after the call.  This
setting is inherited by any child processes so, for example, if the first
process for a control group or virtual machine enables KSM, all descendant
processes will have it enabled as well.
<p>
This feature allows an orchestration system for virtual machines or
containers to enable KSM for the workloads it launches; the use of KSM will
no longer be something that individual processes must opt into.  The
orchestration system may know enough about the workloads it runs to be able
to determine whether KSM can be enabled safely; individual processes
generally lack that view.  Systems where KSM can be enabled in this way,
Roesch said, have "<q>shown a capacity increase of around 20%</q>".  In
other words, the system described by Kivity 15&nbsp;years ago would now be
able to support 180 unproductive LWN readers, which seems like an
improvement for everybody involved.
<p>
The patch set makes a few other changes as well, mostly aimed at improving
the effectiveness metrics produced by KSM, so administrators can determine
whether the run-time overhead of scanning pages is justified by the
resulting memory savings.
<p>
This patch set is currently in its fifth revision.  The comments on
previous postings have mostly been concerned with where the memory savings
are coming from.  In the early days of KSM, the biggest win came from
workloads that kept a lot of zero-filled pages around, but that does not
appear to be the case anymore; KSM is deduplicating a lot of non-zero
pages.  There does not appear to be much that would block this series from
landing upstream in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Marking memory as copy-on-write introduces a side channel attack. That would not happen if user space explicitly marked the memory as read only. For example if a web browser downloads a document from lwn.net it may cache it in memory, but all it will do with that memory is to possibly read it later, and then to forget about it (free it). It doesn’t need to mutate the text in place. Although the process will probably end up overwriting the memory area that held the LWN article, to use it for something else, that is an implementation detail of the memory allocator and application runtime.<br>
<p>
In other words the memory management interface provided by the kernel to the application programmer is quite low level. You request memory (typically indirectly, via a user space allocator library) and it is provided read-write by default. You can make a system call to mark pages read-only but that is clunky and not, at present, well integrated with a higher level language. If you change your program from ‘char x[size]’ to ‘const char x[size]’ then, ideally, that const declaration would not only affect the compile-time type checking. It can be passed through the memory allocator all the way down to the kernel, so that if size is big enough, it might be marked read-only once initially populated. (Roughly speaking that’s the point when the ‘char*’ goes out of scope and only a ‘const char*’ is returned. I am imagining some relatively high-level language, like Java or C# with constness added, or C++ with a bit more runtime management, rather than plain C.)<br>
<p>
If user space can keep the kernel a bit better informed about its planned use of memory — “this part I am going to both read and write and may need to extend; this other bit is also read-write but fixed in size, so I won’t ask to grow it; but all the rest here is read-only for me until I free it” — then there might be some additional protection against user-space exploits. (Again, although explicit system calls exist, I am thinking of a higher level language that manages this automatically, so the programmer doesn’t have to do it by hand. It might also be possible to deduce ‘const’ in some places by static analysis, even without an explicit declaration.) But also, it means the kernel can do a better job of managing resources. A page marked read-only can be shared between processes without CoW cleverness. <br>
<p>
You could even imagine that one day the CPU itself would make use of this info. Read-only data is easy to cache. It doesn’t need write-back or even write-through, and there is no coherence to worry about between different CPUs. Perhaps the latest processor will have one megabyte of expensive, silicon-heavy cache for read-write data, but gigabytes of fast on-board cache for read-only data. At that point there would be an economic incentive to structure applications with separate read-only, append-only, and read-write memory areas. The compiler can help arrange this automatically. <br>
<p>
Thanks for indulging me in this blue-sky mumbling. I dare say there is already an experimental Haskell compiler that does something like this. Or, of course, it has all been done before and there is an architecture from the late 60s that works this way. I’d be interested to hear. <br>

Dunno if Pr1mos actually did it, but it sounds like the sort of thing it could have. It had segmented memory, and iirc the 4000 (octal) block was user program, the OS used the 2000 block, and I think shared libraries were stuffed at 6000.<br>
<p>
So you had things like all the OS code had the executable code at 2000 and all instances used the same 4000 addresses for data, the memory manager making sure each process had its own 4000 segments. I don't see why it couldn't have done something like that.<br>
<p>
BTW, Pr1mos was a derivative of Multics. I get the impression Eunuchs certainly deserved its nickname ...<br>

I think read-only data is very cheap using existing coherence hardware.<br>
<p>
And a compiler's concept of read-only data is different from the CPU's. If you stack- or heap-allocate read-only data then deallocate it and use the memory for something else, that's read-only at the language level but read-write at the CPU level.<br>

Yep, that's what I mean.  The fine-grained distinctions between const and non-const memory at the language level are not visible to the kernel or the CPU.  But they could be.<br>

I suspect it gets more interesting when you consider memory at the system level, not the CPU level - e.g. when you're sharing data between CPU and GPU. There may be no cache coherency protocol within parts of the GPU, or between the GPU and CPU.<br>
<p>
AMD (<a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/vulkan-device-memory/">https://gpuopen.com/learn/vulkan-device-memory/</a>) says 256MB of GPU memory is mapped into the CPU address space over the PCIe bus, where CPU reads are uncached and CPU writes are write-combined (which is basically a tiny CPU cache that's automatically flushed every time you interact with the GPU in any way, like writing to GPU hardware registers or uncached memory or using atomics, so you don't need any explicit synchronisation and it behaves a lot like uncached memory (but faster)). That's great for write-once data: as long as the CPU is writing to memory sequentially(ish), it will send whole cache lines over PCIe and will never fetch any cache lines, while remaining coherent (because it's essentially uncached). But it's terrible for reading that memory from the CPU.<br>
<p>
AMD also maps the host's RAM into the GPU address space, which can be uncached/write-combined on the CPU as above, or it can be cached on the CPU (for efficient reading) and the GPU will snoop the CPU cache to keep it coherent. I presume the latter comes at some performance cost for GPU accesses, so it's only recommended when you really need to read from the CPU.<br>
<p>
Inside the GPU, I think there is often a read-only cache for constants (e.g. <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#device-memory-accesses">https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#de...</a>). GPU programs explicitly annotate data that will be allocated in constant memory. In some cases there's a separate L1 cache that can be used for variables which the compiler identifies as read-only (e.g. <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#global-memory-5-x">https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/ind...</a>). Apparently that's separate from the constant cache because they're optimised for different concurrent access patterns: constant memory is designed for shader uniforms, where every thread reads the same value at the same time, while the L1 cache is designed for textures where every thread reads a different value.<br>

So it seems there are situations where it's useful to consider different types of memory access, and not assume everything is always cache-coherent. But maybe it's just because GPUs are historically optimised for a very specific use case that justifies that complexity, and CPUs might be too general-purpose for that to be worthwhile.<br>

<p>
Shared read-only pages are still a side channel risk, no?  By timing your reads, you could know whether another process had accessed the same page recently, because of caches.<br>

You are right.  I meant the particular side channel attack mentioned in the article, observing the COW delay.  A read-only, maybe-cached page also has a delay you can observe, but perhaps not as great.<br>

      One problem with this idea is granularity: same-page merging works at page granularity, while the data structures used in programming languages often are much smaller.

<p>However, for read-only data that lives until the end of the process, you can allocate it sequentially, and once a page is full, you can make it read-only and try to merge it (and this would be the perfect time when the page should be scanned for merging, but it seems to me that KSM does not do that yet, does it?).

<p>For region-allocated read-only data, one can also try this (and munmap() the pages when the region is freed), but the question is if all the overhead of mprotect(), merging, munmap, and for the next allocations mmap() and clearing the mapped pages is payed for by the benefits of same-page merging.

<p>Anyway, I think that even if programming language implementations would implement this stuff, I expect that there would quite a number of mergeable pages left unmerged if that was the only way to make pages mergeable.

Many programs initialize a lot of memory at startup, all in the same order, all at the same page offsets, more or less accidentally. Many that don't could, with just a bit of prodding. All of that, while not necessarily technically const, is typicall unchanged over the life of the program, after startup.<br>

Having heard the KSM security issue, I wonder if it wouldn't be both more efficient and secure to push pages into swap more aggressively, and then use (say) an in-memory checksum table to do the first test of swap deduplication (also adding a means to detect swap corruption). The security angle is that pages deduplicated in swaps are equally expensive to reference from any of their owners, which complicates the information leak by turning a "has this page been proactively COW'd" observation into "was this page swapped, and then not unswapped by a co-owner". The performance idea is that of turning certain writes into an additional read that nearly always results in deduplication, thereby reducing write load on the swap device.<br>
<p>
One might even imagine a virtual machine guest interface providing a specialized virtual device for swaps so that deduplication would occur in the virtualizer and/or host kernel. This would seemingly achieve KSM's goal while augmenting server-wide resource management. It would also lean on ordinary page replacement rather than more or less ad-hoc proactive scanning.<br>

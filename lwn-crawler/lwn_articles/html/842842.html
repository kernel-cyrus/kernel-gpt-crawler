<a href="/Articles/532593/">User namespaces</a> provide a number of
interesting challenges for the kernel.  They give a user the illusion of
owning the system, but must still operate within the restrictions that
apply outside of the namespace.  <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/vlimit.3.html">Resource
limits</a> represent one type of 
restriction that, it seems, is proving too restrictive for some users.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1610722473.git.gladkov.alexey@gmail.com/">This
patch set</a> from Alexey Gladkov attempts to address the problem by way of
a not-entirely-obvious approach.
<p>
Consider the following use case, as stated in the patch series.  Some user
wants to run a service that is known not to fork within a container.  As a
way of constraining that service, the user sets the resource limit for the
number of processes to one, explicitly preventing the process from
forking.  That limit is global, though, so if this user tries to run two
containers with that service, the second one will exceed the limit and fail
to start.  As a result, our user becomes depressed and considers a career
change to goat farming.
<p>
Clearly, what is needed is a way to make at least some resource limits
apply on per-container basis; then each container could run its service
with the process limit set to one and everybody will be happy (except
perhaps the goats).  One could readily imagine a couple of ways to do this:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Turn the resource limits that apply globally (many are per-process
     now) into limits that can also be set within a user namespace.  The
     global limit would still apply, but lower limits could be set within
     a namespace to get the desired effect.
<li> Create a new control-group controller to manage resource limits in a
     hierarchical manner.  This kind of control, after all, is just what
     control groups were created for.
</ul>
<p>
Gladkov's patch set, though, takes neither of those approaches.

Instead, this patch set moves a number of global resource-usage counters
(processes, pending signals, pages locked in memory, bytes in message
queues) into the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11-rc3/source/include/linux/user_namespace.h#L91"><tt>ucounts</tt>
structure</a> associated with user namespaces.  That makes the
<i>tracking</i> of the use of these resources specific to each namespace.
<p>
User namespaces are arranged hierarchically up to the "initial namespace"
at the root, and there is a <tt>ucounts</tt> structure allocated for each.
The resource-usage counts are managed all the way up the hierarchy.  So, if
a process 
creates a new process within a user namespace, the process count in that
namespace will be incremented, but so will the counts in any higher-level
namespaces.  The resource limit (which is still global) is checked at every
level in the hierarchy; exceeding the limit at any level is cause to block
an operation.
<p>
If one is slow and undercaffeinated like your editor, one might wonder how
this is supposed to work.  Yes, each user namespace will now have its own
count for resources like processes.  If the global limit is set to one,
each user namespace can contain one process without exceeding the limit at
that level.  But the counts propagate upward; if both namespaces have a
common parent, then the limit will be exceeded at that level and our user
is left no happier than before.
<p>
A look at <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/3102e17576584b3bfa5854f457073a42574dec8c.1610722474.git.gladkov.alexey@gmail.com/">the
test code</a> provided with the patch set gives an answer.  In the test
program, the "server" processes are created by root before changing user
and group IDs and moving into a separate user namespace.  The parent
namespace thus belongs to root and is not subject to any resource limits set
after the user-ID change.  It all works as long as one's use case matches
this pattern.
<p>
Still, one might wonder why the other approaches weren't taken.  Having the
limits propagate downward (rather than counts propagating upward) would
seem to address 
this problem as well in a more flexible way that doesn't require root
privileges.  In fact, Linus Torvalds <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgXZmRu762bjSeK80+T_LTo+UP9y5rP-uvym1vquSxmBw@mail.gmail.com/">asked
why this approach wasn't taken</a> in response to a previous version of the
patch set.  Eric Biederman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87a6tfp6sw.fsf@x220.int.ebiederm.org/">answered</a>
that the limit approach "<q>needs to work as well</q>", but then
reiterated the use case without really clarifying why the count-based
approach is needed.
<p>
Using control groups for this purpose was discussed back in 2015.  At that
time, control-group maintainer Tejun Heo <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150227170640.GK3964@htj.duckdns.org/">rejected</a>
the idea, calling it "<q>pretty silly</q>".  He continued:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In general, I'm pretty strongly against adding controllers for
	things which aren't fundamental resources in the system.  What's
	next?  Open files?  Pipe buffer?  Number of flocks?  Number of
	session leaders or program groups?
<p>
	If you want to prevent a certain class of jobs from exhausting a
	given resource, protecting that resource is the obvious thing to
	do.
</div>
<p>
That particular conversation went fairly badly downhill from there, but
this specific outcome has stood over time: control-group controllers are
not used for control of resource limits within containers.
<p>
For users who are facing this problem now, the only apparent solution is
Gladkov's patch set.  Whether these patches are merged will, however,
depend on whether the rest of the kernel community thinks that this
approach is the correct one.  That conversation has not yet happened, and
may depend on a clearer description of the semantics of this change (and
its motivation) being posted first.  Resource limits within containers is a
problem that has remained unsolved for years; it may take longer yet to get
to the real solution.
<p>
<b>Update</b>: as explained in the comments, resource limits are already
per-process, so nothing has to be done on that side to make them adjustable
on a per-container basis.  The <i>counts</i> used to enforce those limits,
though, are global, causing the sort of interference described above.  So
the proposed solution — making the counts local while still aggregating
them upward — appears to make sense.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yes, ulimits are per-user but two processes with the same kuid in two different user namespaces (in other words, they map the to the same underlying user) will have the same limit because the limit is enforced per-kuid (it&#x27;s not linked the user namespace you&#x27;re in). This is a problem because some container runtimes reuse the same mapping for different containers, causing resource exhaustion between containers (and isolated containers a-la LXD have their own issues -- namely a fair number of programs expect to be able to create users with very large uids).<br>

What was unclear about my reply?<br>
<p>
If today the situation is that setting RLIMIT_NPROC == 1 and your service does not start, but it has nor processes in your user namespace.  How can you possibly fix that without changing how the count works?   AKA by making a per user per user_namespace count?<br>

Yes, I wondered about that too while reading the article. Clearly, making counts per-user-namespace is a prerequisite for making resource limits per-user-namespace, so I don&#x27;t understand why the article described the Gladkov&#x27;s patchset as something orthogonal.<br>

      Yes, I guess I see why you need to change the count infrastructure.  Where my confusion comes in is why the limits aren't made per-user-namespace as well.  It seems that would create far more straightforward semantics and the possibility for control without root involvement.

We are talking rlimits so the limits are fundamentally per-process. <br>
<p>
What moving to ucounts does is it captures the per-process limit value at the<br>
time of user namespace creation.  Then when the counts are updated the<br>
outer limit is checked, along with the per-process rlimit counts.<br>
<p>
There is no need here for any root involvement.<br>
<p>
``root&#x27;&#x27; can get involved if you want to modify the limits that were captured at user namespace creation.   Those limits should be exposed as sysctls.  In most cases<br>
it should be safe to ignore them.<br>

      Um....I thought the whole point of this exercise was that some limits are <i>not</i> per-process...?  That's why a process in one container prevents the creation of a process in another?  How can NPROC be per-process?
<p>
I'm clearly missing something here.

The counts are not per process.  The limits are per process.<br>

I&#x27;m a little confused by the problem -- it seems to me that it is rather easy to work around for RLIMIT_NPROC == 1 case.<br>
<p>
i.e. instead of launching the service by doing setrlimit() as root, then fork(), setuid(), execve(); can&#x27;t you do fork(), setuid(), setrlimit(), execve()? This should be fine for the &quot;prevent fork()&quot; situation, no?<br>

Hm I also don&#x27;t get the fix. If the counts are hierarchical, why doesn&#x27;t the setuid() call for the second run fail because there is already one process running for that user in the root namespace?<br>

RLIMIT_NPROC  is some large number in the parent namespace.  So the limit check on the parent namespace passes.  Only in the 2 containers is RLIMIT_NPROC == 1.<br>

I&#x27;m confused. Isn&#x27;t there only one RLIMIT_NPROC for a given process? i.e. I thought that the limits are per-process, and the counts, which used to be per-user are changing to per-user/per-namespace?<br>

The problem statement for containers is make existing code work.  So adding work-arounds for existing code is not a serious option.<br>
<p>
Furthermore the example of a service setting RLIMIT_NPROC==1 while real<br>

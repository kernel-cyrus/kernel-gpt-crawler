           <p>This article was contributed by Neil&nbsp;Brown</p>
           </div>
<a href="/Articles/504814/">Last week</a> we discussed three elements that
might serve to 
guide the creation of introductory technical documentation.  This week
we put those elements to the test by using them to create some
introductory documentation for Linux power management.  For me, this exercise
precisely answers the question "What were you looking for that you
didn't find?", as it is the documentation I would have liked to read.
</p><p>
This documentation is necessarily incomplete, partly because my own
experience is not yet broad enough to provide a comprehensive document,
and partly because doing so might try the patience of the present
readership.  As such it stops short of delving into the details of
hibernation and completely omits any treatment of quality-of-service and
wakeup sources, all of which would have an important place in a more
complete document.  Fortunately there are still sufficient topics to
showcase the presentation of structure, purpose, and examples.
</p>
<h4>Three perspectives on Linux power management</h4>
<p>
The power management infrastructure in Linux is quite complex, but
hopefully not intractably so.  To get a handle on this complexity it
is helpful to view it from three different perspectives.  The first
perspective highlights the different holistic states of the system
which roughly divide into "in use", "not in use", and "indefinitely
not in use", corresponding to "run time power management",
"suspend" and "hibernate".  One of the distinctions between these is
the size of the power switch.  The first uses lots of little power
switches at different times, while the last turns off everything all at
once (except maybe a real-time clock or similar).
</p><p>
The second of these states is somewhat harder to define.  It covers a
range of states which are not easy to clearly differentiate.  At one end
of the spectrum we have the traditional "suspend" mode of a laptop,
which is almost like hibernation but uses a little more power and is a
little quicker to get into and out of.  Once the laptop has entered
suspend it really must stay there using minimal power until it is
explicitly wakened, as it might have been placed in a padded case for
transport and any increase in power usage could result in over-heating
and damage.  This state is often entered with help from BIOS firmware so,
to the OS, it is a bit like a single power switch which transitions from
"on" to "suspend".
</p><p>
At the other end of the spectrum is the way that "suspend" is used in
the Android mobile platform and similar devices.  These devices are
expected to wake up spontaneously for various reasons, whether due to
an incoming phone call, a reminder alarm, or just a periodic check for
new email or software updates.  Management of power and temperature is
generally better than notebooks so the risk of over-heating is not
present.  There is normally little or no firmware and the
entire power-management transition is handled by the OS, so it is
responsible for turning off each individual device in the correct
order, and then restoring them again later.
</p><p>
Between these extremes of a light hibernation and a heavy snooze there
is room for other possibilities.  A server might use a BIOS-based
suspend to save power after arranging for wake-ups via wake-on-LAN or
a realtime clock alarm.  This can be seen as a deeper sleep than an Android
phone normally enters, but not as deep as the laptop in its padded
case.  The "suspend" mode in Linux attempts to  cater to all of these
and that flexibility leads to some of the complexity.
</p><p>
The second perspective highlights the broad variety in components that
need to be managed.  Some, like rotating disk drives, have a high cost
in power and time for turning off and on again, while others like an
LED have essentially no cost.  Some, such as a UART, need to either be
off or sufficiently on to be able to accept full-rate data at any
moment.  Others, such as USB, can enter intermediate states where they
can receive external signaling, but are free to take some time to fully wake
up.
</p><p>
Other sources of variability include the level of independence from
other devices, the degree of involvement of user-space in management of
the device, and how power is routed - whether through the same bus that
commands and data flow, or through some separate regulator or "power
domain".  These are just some of the ways that devices can vary and thus
some of the issues that Linux power management needs to be prepared for.
</p><p>
The final perspective highlights the different stages on the way
towards a low-power state, and on the way back to full functionality.
The key elements of the low-power transition are to move all relevant components
to a quiescent state, to record that state, then to stop powering some or
all of the components; similar elements apply on the way back up.  The details of managing all the aforementioned
complexity through this simple transition means that we have quite a
few stages as we will shortly see.
</p>
<h4>Two Understandings</h4>
<p>
Part of understanding the solution to managing this complexity is
understanding the balance that has been chosen between a
<a href="/Articles/336262/">"mid-layer"</a>
solution and a "library" solution.  That is, how much responsibility
for correct behavior and sequencing is taken by the core code and
imposed on the drivers, and how much of the responsibility is left in
the hands of the drivers.  Centralizing responsibility tends to be
safe but inflexible, while distributing it is risky but versatile.
Linux power management takes a middle road, so it is important to
understand where each responsibility lies.
</p><p>
The main imposition made by the PM core is the over-all sequencing of
suspend and resume.  Allowing individual drivers to take a more active
role in this process would probably require a general dependency solver and
would undoubtedly make debugging a lot harder.  In contrast, choices
that are local to a specific device, such as timeouts before power
management activates, or the use of a separate thread for performing
power management actions are actively supported by the core without being
imposed on drivers that don't want them.
</p><p>
One other imposition, which will be raised again later, involves
interaction with interrupts.  The PM core strongly encourages a specific
sequencing, but does provide hooks for a driver to escape it if
absolutely necessary.
</p><p>
Understanding Linux power management also requires knowing how devices are
classified in Linux.  The most obvious classification is shown by the
"<tt>subsystem</tt>" link that can be found in the <tt>sysfs</tt> entry
for the device.  This points to either a "bus" or a "class" that the
device belongs to.  This subsystem roughly describes the interface that
the device provides.  Together with this can be a "device type" which
allows further specialization.  A simple example is that members of the
class "block" - which are block devices such a disk drives - can be of
type "disk" or type "partition" reflecting the fact that both the whole
device and each individual partition is a block device, but that they do
have some specific behaviors that are quite different.
</p><p>
Finally each device can have a "power domain" (or <tt>pm_domain</tt>).
This is an abstraction that is currently only used for ARM SoC modules
and represents the fact that different collections of devices within
the SoC can be powered on or off together, thus the power domain may
need to know when each device changes power state so it can re-evaluate
or adjust the overall state of the domain.
</p><p>
These classifications are used to direct all the power management
calls that are described below.  If a device has a power domain, it
gets to handle the call.  If not, but the type, class, or bus declares any
PM operations, those operations get to handle the call, otherwise the call is handled by
the driver for the device.  The PM core doesn't attempt to call all of
the possible handlers for a particular device, just the first that is
found.  This is an example of distribution of responsibility. The
first handler has the freedom to call more specific handlers, or to do
all the work itself, and equally has the responsibility to ensure all
required handlers are called.
</p><p>
For example, the power domain handler for the OMAP platform (in
<tt>arch/arm/plat-omap/omap_device.c</tt>)
calls the driver-specific
handler (bypassing any subsystem handlers) before or after doing any
OMAP-specific handling.  The MMC bus handlers call into driver-specific
handlers which are stored in a non-standard location - presumably for
historical reasons.
</p><p>
With these perspective and understandings in place, we can move on to
some specifics.
</p>
<h4>Runtime PM</h4>
<p>
Runtime power management has the fewest states and so is probably the
best place to start digging into details.  This is the part of Linux PM
that manages power for individual devices without taking the whole
system into a low-power state.
</p><p>
In this case the most interesting stage of the transition to lower
power is "move to quiescent state".  Once that is done there is one
method call (<tt>runtime_suspend()</tt>) which combines "record current
state" and "remove power", and another (<tt>runtime_resume()</tt>) which
must restore power and reload any needed device state.
</p><p>
For runtime PM, the "move to quiescent state" transition is a cause, not
an effect - the new state isn't requested, it is simply noticed.  The PM
core keeps track of the activity of each device using two counters and
an optional timer.  One counter (<tt>usage_count</tt>) counts active
references to the device. These may be external references such as open
file handles, or other devices that are making use of this one, or they
may be internal references used to hold the device active for the
duration of some operation.  The other counter (<tt>child_count</tt>)
counts the number of children that are active.  The timer can be used to
add a delay between the counters reaching zero and the device being
considered to be idle.  This is useful for devices with a high cost for
turning on or off.
</p><p>
This "autosuspend" timer is not widely used at present, with only nine
drivers calling <tt>pm_runtime_put_autosuspend()</tt> to start the
timer, while 14 call <tt>pm_runtime_set_autosuspend_delay()</tt> which
sets the timeout (though that can be set via sysfs).  One user is the
<tt>omap_hsmmc</tt> driver for the High Speed Multi-Media Card
interface in OMAP processors.  It sets a 100ms delay before declaring
a device to be truly idle, presumably due to costs in activating and
deactivating the cards.
</p><p>
The counter of active children can optionally be ignored when
determining whether a device is idle.  Normally the parent is needed
to access the child - typically the parent is a bus sending commands
to the child - so powering down the parent while children are active
would be counterproductive.  Sometimes it is useful though.
</p><p>
One good example is an I2C bus.  I2C (inter-integrated circuit) is a
very simple 2-wire bus for signaling between integrated circuits on a
board.  It doesn't carry power, only a clock signal and a
bidirectional data signal.  The bus is entirely master-driven.  Slaves
(which appears as children in the Linux device tree) cannot signal the
master directly at all, they simply respond to commands from the master.
</p><p>
As an I2C controller is very cheap to turn on
before a command is sent, and off after the response is received,
there is no need to keep it powered just because its child (which
could be a sensor that is monitoring the environment and may have a
higher turn-on cost) is left on.  Consequently some I2C controllers,
such as <tt>i2c-nomadik</tt> and <tt>i2c-sh_mobile</tt> use
<tt>pm_suspend_ignore_children()</tt> to allow them to report as idle
even when they have active children.
</p><p>
When a device is deemed to be idle by the above criteria its
<tt>runtime_idle()</tt> method is called.  This function will normally perform
any further checks (as does <tt>usb_runtime_idle()</tt>) and possibly
call <tt>pm_runtime_suspend()</tt> to initiate the change in power state.  For
a slight variation, <tt>lnw_gpio_runtime_idle()</tt> in the
<tt>gpio-langwell.c</tt> driver doesn't call <tt>pm_runtime_suspend()</tt>
directly but rather calls <tt>pm_schedule_suspend()</tt> with a 500ms
delay.  Presumably this design predates the introduction of the
autosuspend feature.
</p><p>
There is one class of devices that does not follow this structure for
power management, and that is the CPU.  The general pattern of entering
a quiescent state, recording state information, and reducing power usage
is the same, however the particular implementation is vastly different.
This is partly due to the uniquely central role that the CPU plays, and partly
due to the fact that a CPU typically has many more levels and styles of
power saving.
Runtime PM for the CPU is implemented using
the <tt>cpuidle</tt>, <tt>cpufreq</tt>, and <tt>CPU hotplug</tt>
subsystems, which will not be discussed further here; see <a
href="/Articles/384146/">this article</a> for an introduction to cpuidle.
</p>
<h4>System Suspend</h4>
<p>
It can be helpful to view the "suspend" process as forcing all devices
into a quiescent state, and then simply allowing runtime power
management to put them all to sleep.  The last to go to sleep would be
the CPU (or CPUs) under the guidance of "cpuidle".  While this isn't
the way it is actually implemented, it provides a perspective which
exposes the relationship between suspend and runtime PM quite well.
</p><p>
There are several reasons for not implementing it this way.  Possibly
the most unavoidable is that PM_RUNTIME and SUSPEND are separate
kernel config options and there is a desire to keep it that way, so
neither can rely on the other being present.  There is also the fact
that a BIOS (such as ACPI) might be involved in one or the other and
may impose different handling requirements.  Finally, individual
drivers might want to make different decisions based on what sort of
power management is happening, so it is generally best to tell them
what is actually happening, rather than pretending that one thing is a
form of another.
</p><p>
Forcing devices into a quiescent state has an important difference
from just allowing them to get there on their own - any interdependencies between
devices need to be explicitly handled.  Linux PM has chosen to manage
this by having a clear sequence of steps for transitioning to low
power, and an explicit ordering of devices so that they make each step
in a well defined order.
</p><p>
The ordering (stored in <tt>dpm_list</tt> linked through
<tt>dev-&gt;power.entry</tt>) is normally the order in which devices
are registered, with new devices added to the end, thus being after any
devices that they depend on.  However it is possible to reorder the
list using <tt>device_move()</tt> which gives a device a new parent, and
can place it directly after that parent, or at the end of the list.
For example, when an <tt>rfcomm</tt> tty-over-bluetooth device is
opened, a bluetooth connection is created and the tty device is
reparented under the relevant bluetooth device and placed at the end of
the device list.
</p><p>
The first stage of suspend, after some preliminaries like calling
"sync" to flush out dirty data and switching to a separate virtual
console, is to move all processes into a quiescent state.  Devices
which interact closely with processes need a chance to have one last
chat before their process goes to sleep and this is achieved by
registering a "notifier" which gets called before processes are put to
sleep, and again when they are woken up.
</p><p>
This is variously used to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>load firmware in case it will be needed during resume
    </li>
<p>
<li>copy device state to swappable memory as may be needed when
    the device state can be enormous such as video RAM
    (<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v3.4/drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_drv.c#L991">drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx</a>)
    </li>
<p>
<li>avoid deadlock when interacting with sysfs
    (<tt><a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v3.4/drivers/acpi/battery.c#L953">drivers/acpi/battery.c</a></tt>)
    </li>
<p>
<li>preemptively remove devices that might be removed while the system
    is suspended, so appropriate cleanup can happen
    (<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v3.4/drivers/mmc/core/core.c#L2358">drivers/mmc/core</a>)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
and a few other minor tasks.

Once these notifiers run, all processes are sent a special signal which
results them being moved to the "freezer" where they are forced to
wait for system resume to happen.
</p><p>
Once all processes are quiescent, the next step is to instruct all
devices to also become quiescent.  To do this we need to walk the
list in reverse order, putting children to sleep before their parents
- as the parent may be needed to help put the child to sleep.  However
as a new child could be born at any moment (e.g. due to a device being
plugged in), and as children get added to the end of the list, we
might miss some children on the first pass.  To avoid this, the PM
core makes two passes over the list.  The first pass starts at the
beginning and simply asks devices to stop adding children by calling
their "<tt>prepare()</tt>" method.  If children are born during this time they
can only be added after the current pointer in the list, and so will
not be missed.  Once this is complete we know that no new devices will
be added, so the list is walked in the reverse order calling the
"suspend" method.
</p><p>
The "suspend" method is actually three separate methods, <tt>suspend()</tt>,
<tt>suspend_late()</tt>, and <tt>suspend_noirq()</tt>, which can share among themselves
the three tasks of making the device quiescent, saving any state, and
reducing power usage.  How much of which task is allocated to which
methods is largely up to each driver providing that the division works
with the calling patterns of the three methods.
</p><p>
Calls to these methods are made to all devices in child-before-parent
order and the sets of calls are interleaved with system-wide suspend
operations, made largely through the <tt>suspend_ops</tt> dispatch
table.  The ordering is roughly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>     system wide <tt>begin()</tt>
  </li>
<li>     per-device <tt>suspend()</tt>
  </li>
<li>     system wide <tt>prepare()</tt>
  </li>
<li>     per-device <tt>suspend_late()</tt>
  </li>
<li>     system wide disable (almost) all interrupt handlers
  </li>
<li>     per-device <tt>suspend_noirq()</tt>
  </li>
<li>     system wide <tt>prepare_late()</tt>
  </li>
<li>     disable nonboot CPUs
  </li>
<li>     <tt>syscore_suspend()</tt>
  </li>
<li>     system wide <tt>enter()</tt>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that it is possible for the sequence from system wide
<tt>prepare()</tt> onwards to be repeated (after being unwound by
corresponding "resume" actions) without going all the way up to fully
awake and starting the sequence from the top.  This happens if
the <tt>suspend_again()</tt> suspend operation requests it. Currently
this is only requested by the charger manager which often needs to
wake up parts of the system to check battery charging state, without
wanting the cost of a full wakeup.
</p><p>
Deducing the purpose of these method calls by looking for example
usage in the code is problematic for a number of reasons.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> For the system-wide operations (<tt>begin()</tt>, <tt>prepare()</tt>,
   <tt>prepare_late()</tt>), there are few users and those that exist
   do not make their purpose clear to an untrained observer.  The
   most complete user is ACPI, so possibly a full understanding of
   that specification would help.  Unfortunately that is beyond the
   scope of this article (and of this author).
   </p><p>
   In general, ACPI recommends specific procedures for entering and
   leaving system sleep states (such as suspend) and Linux PM was
   modeled on that and then adjusted to meet broader needs.  For
   example, <tt>prepare_late()</tt> was
   <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commitdiff;h=6a7c7eaf71b636f197d73b381a2ab729ebdcfb2e">added</a>
   to resolve a conflict between the needs of ACPI and the needs of
   the ARM platform.
   </li>
<p>
<li> For the per-device operations, <tt>suspend_late()</tt> was only
   recently added (commit cf579dfb82550e3) and there are no users
   in Linux-3.4.  So any examples we find may be working around the
   absence of <tt>suspend_late()</tt> and so should not be copied.
   </li>
<p>
<li> The initial reason for producing this document was finding
   code in drivers that simply wasn't working correctly and trying to
   understand what "correctly" might mean.  Those drivers clearly
   cannot be used as good examples and there is
   <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-mmc@vger.kernel.org/msg13373.html"
   title="Note: blatant abuse of the PM infrastructure">evidence</a>
   that other drivers aren't always doing
   the right thing, so any example may be equally faulty.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
Examining the documentation brings a little more useful information.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>suspend()</tt> should leave the device in a
    <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v3.4/include/linux/pm.h#L108">quiescent state</a>
    </li>
    <p>
<li> <tt>suspend_late()</tt> can often be the

     as <tt>runtime_suspend()</tt> (see also
     <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commit;h=cf579dfb82550e3">commit cf579dfb82550e3</a>)
    </li>
<p>
<li> <tt>suspend_noirq()</tt> happens after interrupts are disabled and
   is useful 
   when
   <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v3.4/Documentation/power/devices.txt#L345">shared interrupts</a>
   are used as you can be certain that the
   interrupt handler will not be called after <tt>suspend_noirq()</tt> runs.
   Some interrupts, such as the
   <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v3.4/kernel/irq/pm.c#L21">timer interrupt</a>, are not disabled.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
One observation from the code that seems to be important before we try
to paint the big picture is that, after calling the <tt>suspend()</tt>
method on a device, runtime power management is
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v3.4/drivers/base/power/main.c#L1096">disabled</a>.
The purpose of this seems to be to stop runtime PM from racing with
system suspend PM - we really don't want two threads
trying to power off a device at once, and this is the interlock that
prevents that.  It also prevents runtime PM from powering the device
back on again, so any device that might be needed in the late states
of power management needs to be left on when runtime PM is disabled.
</p><p>
Tying all these threads together we get that:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> The <tt>suspend()</tt> method should cause the device to stop doing
   anything, and enter a state much like it would be just before runtime
   PM might decide to turn it off.  So it should wait for any DMA
   requests to complete and ensure new ones won't start.  It should
   stop transmitting information and ensure that incoming information
   is either ignored, or triggers a wake-from-suspend (possibly
   marking the interrupt for wakeups).  It should cancel any timers
   and generally prepare for nothing to happen for a while.
   </p><p>
   If the device might be needed to power down other devices, such as
   an I2C controller that might be needed to tell some regulator to turn off,
   then the device should be activated for runtime PM purposes so that
   it will still be active when runtime PM is disabled.
   </p><p>
   Part of the task of ignoring incoming information is to ensure that no
   new children will be created much like the runtime PM
   <tt>prepare()</tt> method does.  Having new devices appear after
   <tt>suspend()</tt> would be awkward.
   </p></li>
<p>
<li><p> The <tt>suspend_late()</tt> method should power off the device in
   much the same way that <tt>runtime_suspend()</tt> does, and it may be
   exactly the same routine as <tt>runtime_suspend()</tt>.
   Occasionally preparing the device to wake up may differ between the
   system suspend and runtime PM cases.  This would be one situation where
   <tt>suspend_late()</tt> might need to be different from
   <tt>runtime_suspend()</tt>.
   </p><p>
   The only case where <tt>suspend_late()</tt> should not be used is
   where interrupts might still be delivered, but the interrupt
   handler cannot tolerate the device being off.  In many cases
   the <tt>suspend()</tt> routine will have put the device in a state in
   which it will not generate interrupts.  Likely exceptions to this
   are when the interrupt line is shared, or when the device supports
   wake-from-suspend and so deliberately does not disable interrupts.
   </p><p>
   If the platform that the device runs on uses BIOS support to enter
   suspend, then it is possible that this support will power off the
   device, so <tt>suspend_late()</tt> does not need to bother.  If it
   doesn't, it could still be that the device gets powered off by
   instructing the BIOS to effect the state change, and it may require
   different power-off procedures for runtime PM and for entering
   suspend.  If this is the case, then <tt>suspend_late()</tt> will
   quite likely be very different from <tt>runtime_suspend()</tt>.
   </p></li>
<p>
<li><p> The <tt>suspend_noirq()</tt> method is an alternative to
   <tt>suspend_late()</tt> but is run without interrupts enabled.  It is
   unlikely that any driver will provide both methods.
   </p><p>
   Having interrupts disabled means not only that an interrupt will not
   occur at an awkward time, but also that using any functionality
   that requires interrupts will not work.  So if the driver uses an
   I2C bus or similar to tell the device to turn off, and if the I2C bus uses
   interrupts to indicate completion (which is normal), then either
   the device must be powered-off in <tt>suspend_late</tt>, or the I2C
   interrupt must be marked IRQF_NO_SUSPEND.
   </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Paired with each of these methods is a method that is called when
returning back towards full-functionality:  <tt>resume_noirq()</tt>,
<tt>resume_early()</tt> and <tt>resume()</tt>.  These simply do the
reverse of what the corresponding "suspend" function did.
</p>
<h4>Closing</h4>
<p>
Structure, purpose, and examples - these seem to be the elements that
distinguish good documentation and enable the reader not just to
collect knowledge but to gain understanding.  I'll leave you, dear
reader, to be the judge of whether their presence here is sufficient
to bring an understanding of power management, or indeed an
understanding of quality documentation.

Nice article. I wish i had read this when i started looking into Linux PM :)<br>
Will this remain as an LWN page or do you have plans to get it into the Documentation/ folder?<br>

Good question.  It might be nice to move it to Documentation/.  It might also be nice to adding the other bits that I left out.  Whether I find the motivation remains to be seen :-)  I'll definitely give it some serious thought.<br>

The one thing I don't get from reading this is how much of this is just how it happens to work riqht now, and how much is how it ought to work. Does it really need to be this hairy, or is its current state a product of driver bugs and incomplete designs or implementations?<br>

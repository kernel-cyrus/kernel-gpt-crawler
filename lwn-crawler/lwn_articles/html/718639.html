We are getting closer to being able to do unprivileged mounts inside
containers, but there are still some pieces that do not work well in that
scenario.  In particular, the user IDs (and group IDs) that are embedded
into filesystem images are problematic for this use case.  James Bottomley
led a discussion on the problem in a session at the 2017 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit.
</p>

<p>
The various containerization solutions in Linux (Docker, LXC, rkt, etc.)
all use the same container interfaces, he said.  That leads to people
pulling in different directions for different use cases.  But the problem
with UIDs stored in filesystem images affects all of them.  These
images are typically full root filesystems for the containers that have
lots of files owned by the root user.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Bottomley has <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/20/655">proposed
shiftfs</a> as a potential solution to this problem.  It is similar to a
bind mount, but translates the filesystem UIDs based on the user namespace
mapping.  It can be used by unprivileged containers to mount a subtree that
has been specifically marked by the administrator as being shiftfs-mountable.
</p>

<p>
An earlier effort to solve the problem added the <tt>s_userns</tt> field to
the superblock in order to do UID translations, but that is a
per-superblock solution that does not work well for containers that want to
share a specific mounted filesystem among containers with different UID
mappings.  With 
shiftfs, an inode operation will translate the UID based on the namespace
mapping to that of the underlying filesystem before passing the operation
the lower level.  That means the virtual filesystem (VFS) does not need changes,
which makes for a cleaner solution, Bottomley said.
</p>

<p>
There are some significant security implications to allowing arbitrary
directory trees to be shift-mounted in unprivileged containers, including
the ability for users to create setuid-root binaries.  So the administrator
must mark those subtrees (using extended attributes in his prototype) that
are safe to be mounted that way.
</p>

<p>
Al Viro asked if there is a plan to allow mounting hand-crafted XFS or ext4
filesystem images.  That is an easy way for an attacker to run their own
code in ring&nbsp;0, he said.  The filesystems are not written to expect
that kind of (ab)use.  When asked if it really was that easy to crash the kernel
with a hand-crafted filesystem image, Viro said: "is water wet?"
</p>

<p>
Amir Goldstein said that the current mechanism is to use FUSE to mount the
filesystems in the unprivileged containers.  But Bottomley is concerned
that the FUSE daemon can be exploited, so it should run in the unprivileged
container as well.  If you restrict the mounts to USB sticks, it means an
attacker would need physical access, which has plenty of other paths for
system compromise so it is "safe" in that sense.  But if loopback mounting
of filesystems is to be 
supported at some point, the filesystem code will need to have no
exploitable bugs.
</p>

<p>
In something of an aside, Goldstein reminded filesystem developers that
their filesystems may be running under <a
href="/Articles/403012/">overlayfs</a>.  He suggested that there needs to
be more testing of different
filesystems underneath overlayfs. 

<p>
While the attendees recognized the problem for unprivileged containers,
there does not seem to be a 
consensus on the right route to take to solve it.

We've had to work around this UID mapping issue at my company. For our internal distributed file system, we have mount options for how to present things to the local system. Then, the file system's implementation tells the local system whatever it needs to hear for the specified UID to have appropriate permissions.<br>
<p>
It works, but I'm glad to see a more comprehensive approach happening upstream.<br>

It's our own, FUSE-based client (and our own server as well). Because our containers already run as specific users, it's pretty easy to mount a file system while telling the mount options which user will access it. Then, the mount makes everything appear appropriately for that user. (Permissions are also enforced on the file system's server-side. The mounts use mutual TLS with the server, so we have cryptographic proof of access to the certificate associated with the container.)<br>
<p>
We don't create mounts intended for multi-user or multi-container access, and this allows us to present permissions in such a simplified way. However, I'd assume the same is true for most mounts done within containers.<br>

I have found that running related container under the same user id greatly simplifies things. To restrict access to the files I selectively bind-mount parts of the tree owned by that user either readonly or writable depending on container needs.<br>

Oh dear. If you think making mount(2) directly accessible to UID&gt;0 is going to violate its sanctity and cause a security apocalypse *today*, I've got some bad news, some 10-year-old DEs, and a setuid-root javascript interpreter for you...<br>

My point is HAL/pmount/UDisks+polkit/next-week's-cadt-abomination have been handing out mount(2) access for close to 15 years to exactly the sort of user who *can't* use it safely. People are going to jam the free USB stick they found on the floor into their computer, and the same sort of people nowadays will `curl freeponies.io|docker` like it's a sane thing to do. There isn't a cluebat in the world big enough to fix this.<br>
<p>
But: at least if this was in the kernel (and off-by-default for the rest of us) they could go shoot themselves in the foot with a properly built gun, instead of their distro handing them a 3D-printed one made out of spaghetti.<br>

Yeah, that was also my thought -- it's not like we've made it hard for people to provide their own block devices to mount. And furthermore, why should we not treat ext4 and XFS bugs that arise from this as critical? Isn't that just good security practice?<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; And furthermore, why should we not treat ext4 and XFS bugs that arise from this as critical?</font><br>
<p>
We do, and we fix them as they arise. But /that's not the problem/ with accessing user controlled fs images inside the kernel.<br>
<p>
The real issue is that the trust environment the existing filesystems were designed to work under  simply doesn't stand up to this usage model. Filesystems like ext4 and XFS /implicitly trust/ the contents of the storage media because they believe that they are the only entity that has permission to write to the storage media. e.g. XFS was designed 25 years ago to run on storage hardware that is permanently plugged into a host, with only root (who has the highest trust level available) having the ability to modify the block device without going through the filesystem first.<br>
<p>
As such, finding and fixing these problems will just be an endless game of whack-a-mole. We all know how hard it is to retrofit support for new threat models to old trust models in a manner that is correct, safe, robust and with 100% coverage. It's just not worth the effort to do this for existing filesystems because they require fundamental changes. And, quite frankly, even if we bounds check every field in the filesystem metadata, we're still not safe because we can't do things like verify that directory entries point to the correct inode when reading the directory.... i.e. without a cryptographically secure method of verifying every piece of metadata in the filesystem, we can never be sure that it hasn't been tampered with.<br>
<p>
New filesystems are being designed with such threat models in mind - encryption of everything from the ground up (e.g. as Kent Overstreet is doing with bcachefs) - so the future will be better....<br>

<p>
Almost. Allowing *untrusted* physically-present users to mount USB sticks is an unsupported use-case with current filesystems.<br>
<p>
Just as the filesystem trusts that root user doesn't mess with the block device directly, it also trust that physically-present users doesn't mess with the block device before plugging it in. If the user (root and/or physically-present) betrays that trust, all bets are off...<br>

Someone should probably tell the distributions that - we're well past the point where physical presence implies root in general.<br>

Almost. Allowing physically-present users to mount *untrusted* USB sticks is an unsupported use-case with current filesystems.<br>
<p>
Important difference there - it's the USB stick that is the threat, not the user. Even a trusted user can be tricked into inserting a USB device (e.g. via social engineering) that contains auto-executing exploits in malicious firmware (e.g. badUSB)....<br>

This remains a pretty huge and mostly unadvertised constraint, and if it's the (understandable) position of filesystem developers it really needs to be more widely communicated.<br>

libguestfs is safer, but not safe - you could combine an FS exploit with a KVM breakout exploit if you know your target is using libguestfs, but it's a much, much harder target<br>

The main difficulty I have with containers (docker) and file UIDs are not with the files in the layers but with UID mismatches between processes running in a container and bind mounts from the host filesystem.   In particular, it is easy to end up with files in a bind mounted directory that have a different UID/GID than the user that invoked the container.  Eg., a user with a UID of 1234 bind mounts `~/foo` into a container and the container writes a bunch of files with a UID of 2345.  The inverse scenario is also a problem when trying to pass files in via a bind mount.<br>
<p>
The existing patterns I'm aware of to deal with this are to either build a new container locally that matches the UID/GIDs of the invoking user or to use docker volumes.  The former is a bit of a PITA for an end user trying to consume a published container and the later presents a cleanup problem with dangling volumes.<br>

Do I understand correctly that your problem is that you'd like to get the same numerical user IDs in the container as the user has on the host system ?<br>
That's at least the problem we have, and so far we ended up with a startup script which creates a user with the same numerical ID in docker.<br>
It feels very hackish. Isn't this a standard problem ?<br>

Maybe the best approach is just to do 'file system as a service'.. via NFSv4-style mounts or whatever.  Extend the NFSv4 daemons so you can piece together file systems how you want on the back-end.  Then implement root_squash and UID numbering offsets/translations features into the daemon.  Have writes get redirected to special directories and tmpfs.  Leave the kernel out of it as much as possible.<br>

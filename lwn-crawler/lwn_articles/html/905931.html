<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 26, 2022</br>
           </div>
Filesystems maintain a lot of metadata about the files they hold; most of
this metadata is for consumption by user space.  Some metadata, though,
stays buried within the filesystem and is not visible outside of the
kernel.  One such 
piece of metadata is the file version count, known as <tt>i_version</tt>.
Current efforts to change how <tt>i_version</tt> is managed — and to make
it visible to user space — have engendered a debate on what
<tt>i_version</tt> actually means and what its behavior should be.
<p>
<h4>Early versions of <tt>i_version</tt></h4>
<p>
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=f65d0bc9c2463a61d13856e722de507b659c7c14">Version
0.99.7</a> of the kernel was released on March&nbsp;13, 1993.  Those were
exciting times; among other things, this release included a version of the
<tt>mmap()</tt> system call that was, according to a young Linus Torvalds,
"<q>finally starting to really 
happen</q>".  This release also brought a new filesystem by Rémy Card
called "ext2fs" — the distant ancestor of the ext4 filesystem currently used by many
Linux systems.
<p>
As part of the ext2fs addition, the kernel's <tt>inode</tt> structure was
augmented with a field called <tt>i_version</tt>, which was noted in a
comment as being for the NFS filesystem.  Nothing actually <i>used</i> that
field until the <a 
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=7e8425884852b83354ab090a07715c6c32918f37">0.99.14
release</a>
in November of that year, when an <tt>ioctl()</tt> call was added to
provide access to <tt>i_version</tt>.  Those of us who were valiantly
trying to use NFS on 
Linux in those days will remember that the server ran in user space then,
so this <tt>ioctl()</tt> call was needed for <tt>i_version</tt> to
be useful for NFS.
<p>
Initially, <tt>i_version</tt> was incremented whenever a given inode number
was reused for a new file.  This is an event that the NFS server needs to
know about; otherwise a file handle created for one file could be used to
access a completely different file that happened to end up with the same
inode number, with aesthetically displeasing results.  <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=9ffb8c3a195">Version
2.2.3pre1</a> in 1999 added a new <tt>i_generation</tt> field to be used
for this purpose instead, though it was not actually used until the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=f17051d751d">2.3.1pre1</a>
development kernel in May of that year.  When <tt>i_generation</tt> took
over this role, <tt>i_version</tt> became a sort of counter for versions of
the <i>same</i> file, incremented on changes in a filesystem-specific way
(for filesystems that managed <tt>i_version</tt> at all).
<p>
While <tt>i_generation</tt> was all that the NFS server needed to carry out its
task of creating the dreaded "stale file handle" errors when a file is
replaced, there was still a role for <tt>i_version</tt>.  NFS will perform
far better if it can cache data locally, but doing so safely requires knowledge of
when a file's contents change; <tt>i_version</tt> can be used for that
purpose.  Those who are interested in the details can read <a
href="/Articles/898262/">this article by Neil Brown</a> on how cache
consistency is maintained in current versions of NFS.
<p>
<h4>The trouble with <tt>i_version</tt> now</h4>
<p>
In the nearly 30 years since <tt>i_version</tt> was introduced, there has
been little in the way of formal description of what the field is supposed
to mean.  In 2018, Jeff Layton <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ae5e165d855dd">added some comments</a>
describing how <tt>i_version</tt> was meant to be used, which clarified
some details.  As it turns out, though, some details remain to be
nailed down, and they are creating trouble now.
<p>
Layton's text says: "<q>The <tt>i_version</tt> must appear different to
observers if there was a change to the inode's data or metadata since it
was last queried</q>".  That has been the deal between the virtual
filesystem (VFS) layer and the filesystems for years, but now there is a
desire to alter it.  In its current form, it seems that <tt>i_version</tt>
is creating some performance difficulties.
<p>
As described above, NFS uses <tt>i_version</tt> to detect when a file has changed.  If
an NFS client has portions of a file cached, an <tt>i_version</tt> change
will cause it to discard those caches, leading to more traffic with the
server.  The kernel's integrity measurement architecture (IMA), which
ensures that files have not been tampered with by comparing them against
trusted checksums, also uses <tt>i_version</tt>; if a file has changed, it
must be re-checksummed before access can be allowed.  In either case,
spurious <tt>i_version</tt> increments will cause needless extra work to be
done, hurting performance.
<p>
These unwanted increments are indeed happening, as it turns out, and the cause is
an old villain: <a href="/Articles/244829/">access-time (atime)
tracking</a>.  By default, Unix filesystems will note every time that a
file is read in that file's atime field.  This record-keeping turns an otherwise read-only
operation into a filesystem write and can be bad for performance on its own;
for this reason, there are a number of options for disabling atime updates.
If they are enabled, though, every atime update will, since it changes the
metadata in a file's inode, increment
<tt>i_version</tt>, with the bad results described above.
<p>
<h4>Rethinking <tt>i_version</tt></h4>
<p>
Layton has decided to do something about that problem, resulting in a
number of related patch sets.  <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20220819115641.14744-1-jlayton@kernel.org/">This
patch</a>, for example, makes <tt>i_version</tt> visible in the <a
href="/Articles/707602/"><tt>statx()</tt></a> system call, exposing it to
user space for the first time (the old ext2 <tt>ioctl()</tt> command still
exists, but it returns <tt>i_generation</tt> rather than
<tt>i_version</tt>).  The stated purpose is to make it easier to 
test its behavior and to
facilitate the writing of user-space NFS servers.  <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20220822134011.86558-1-jlayton@kernel.org/">Another
patch</a> causes the XFS filesystem to not update <tt>i_version</tt> for
atime updates; there is <a
href="/ml/linux-ext4/20220819113620.12048-1-jlayton%40kernel.org/">a
similar patch</a> for ext4.  Finally, there is <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/20220822133309.86005-1-jlayton@kernel.org/">an
update</a> to the <tt>i_version</tt> comments making it explicit that atime
updates should not increment that field.
<p>
Resistance to this work has come primarily from XFS developer Dave Chinner,
who <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/20220816224257.GV3600936@dread.disaster.area/">called</a>
the changed <tt>i_version</tt> rules "<q>misguided</q>".  He had a number
of complaints, starting with the fact that XFS sees <tt>i_version</tt>
rather differently and <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/20220822233231.GJ3600936@dread.disaster.area/">updates
it frequently</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	In case you didn't realise, XFS can bump iversion 500+ times for a
	single 1MB write() on a 4kB block size filesystem, and only one of
	them is initial write() system call that copies the data into the
	page cache. The other 500+ are all the extent allocation and
	manipulation transactions that we might run when persisting the
	data to disk tens of seconds later.
</blockquote>
<p>
This behavior, he said, is tied to how <tt>i_version</tt> is stored
on-disk, meaning that changes to its semantics need to be treated like a
disk-format change.  He <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/20220818013251.GC3600936@dread.disaster.area/">argued</a>
that what is being requested is essentially the <a
href="/Articles/621046/">lazytime mount option</a>, which is implemented at
the VFS level.  If NFS needs lazytime-like semantics for <tt>i_version</tt>, he
said, that should also be implemented at the VFS level so that all filesystems
will behave in the same way.
<p>
Layton <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/fb5d972e82b310154c5a6cf6dc6fc3cdfa8c3036.camel@kernel.org/">responded</a>
that lazytime semantics don't really help, since they simply defer the
atime updates and will still result in unwanted <tt>i_version</tt> bumps.
He also <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/b8cf4464cc31dc262a2d38e66265c06bf1e35751.camel@kernel.org/">said</a>
that, since the only consumers for <tt>i_version</tt> are in the kernel,
its semantics can be changed without creating further problems.  Chinner <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/20220823000500.GL3600936@dread.disaster.area/">disagreed</a>
with that claim, saying that his forensic-analysis tools make heavy use of
that field in the on-disk images.  It might not be possible to change the
behavior of <tt>i_version</tt> in XFS without an on-disk format change.
<p>
Despite all of this, Chinner has <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/20220822233231.GJ3600936@dread.disaster.area/">let it
be known</a> that he is not really opposed to the change, except for one
thing: he wants a tight specification of just how <tt>i_version</tt> is
meant to behave, especially if it will be exposed to user space.  Trond
Myklebust <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/c77a3f07e45f0c99019517f3b92d0bdbecf884af.camel@hammerspace.com/">suggested</a>
that <tt>i_version</tt> should only change in response to explicit
operations — those in which user space has requested a change to the file.
Changes to atime are, instead, implicit since user space has not asked for
them, so they should not result in <tt>i_version</tt> updates.
Layton <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/6cbcb33d33613f50dd5e485ecbf6ce7e305f3d6f.camel@kernel.org/">said</a>
that it could simply be defined as any operation that updates an inode's
mtime or ctime fields.  Neil Brown had <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/166129348704.23264.10381335282721356873@noble.neil.brown.name/">a
more complex proposal</a> that would use the ctime field directly while
providing the higher resolution needed for NFS.
<p>
In the end, though, Layton <a
href="/ml/linux-xfs/6fc746c24be6f2c28ea39e76f01e57b14f91b90d.camel@kernel.org/">argued</a>
that "<q>the time to write a specification for i_version was when it was
created</q>" and that he's doing his best to fix the problems long after
that time.  But, he
said, it is "<q>probably best to define this as loosely as possible so that
we can make it easier for a broad range of filesystems to implement
it</q>".  An occasional spurious bump is not a huge problem, but the
regular increments caused by atime updates are.  Fixing that problem should
be good enough.
<p>

For all the noise of the discussion, the disagreements are likely smaller
than they seem.  It is a good opportunity to get a better understanding of
what this 30-year-old field really means, and to adjust its behavior to the
benefit of Linux users.  The next step would appear to be the posting
another version of the patches by Layton, at which point we will get a
sense for whether there is enough of a consensus around the proposed
changes to get them merged.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Isn&#x27;t updating the atime absolutely a change in the metadata, meaning NFS really _should_ discard at least the metadata cache in that case. Yeah it&#x27;s horrible for performance but if you have atime turned on you presumably care about it! After all it&#x27;s horrible for performance in many other, non i_version related ways.<br>

It&#x27;s technically a metadata change, but it&#x27;s not one that&#x27;s &quot;interesting&quot; for NFSv4 or IMA (or really, anyone). We don&#x27;t want to invalidate any caches or anything due to an atime change, since that is _all_ that has changed and there were no other observable effects.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, the only way to _see_ the atime is to do a stat or a statx, and in that case you&#x27;ll almost certainly need to issue a GETATTR on NFS anyway, in which case you&#x27;ll get the new atime that you&#x27;re interested in.<br>
<p>
The best I&#x27;ve come up with so far is to define this such that when POSIX (or whatever) mandates that the ctime be changed, we would also want to change the i_version.<br>

      The problem with mtime and ctime is that they don't have anything near the required resolution to catch every change.  Neil's article, linked in this article, describes those issues in detail.

It was a good practice to mount NFS ro for shared executable filesystems to avoid in service meta data changes, it worked well because they were not updated frequently.  Originally in UNIX it was the update(8) process which synced the disks every 30s that saved inodes in batches, stored together in dense blocks.  Smaller slower disks perhaps deterred careless use of commands like find over /, if you were compiling it wasn&#x27;t that fast either.<br>
<p>
From a sysadmin point of view, too much is made of atime updates, the lazy 24 hour cooldown works well enough in practice and you can turn atimes off.  Secondly filesystem implementors could choose a way to save atime updates to disks more efficiently separate from priority disk updates (lost atime won&#x27;t cause fs data corruption worse than what Linux allows already by ignoring file access), they don&#x27;t care as developers don&#x27;t need atimes, it&#x27;s sysadmin&#x27;s tracking scope of activity if some disaffected user say maliciously deleted/corrupted data.<br>
<p>
If you&#x27;re relying on NFS client file systems file times for some distributed network program, your system is effectively broken.<br>

Isn&#x27;t the obvious solution to introduce new attribute &quot;i_version_content&quot; which is only incremented when the actual file content does change and not trying to change the semantic of an existing attribute with unclear semantic?<br>

NFSv4 also needs it to be incremented on certain types of metadata changes. Size changes (which would imply a content change), but also permissions, ownership, link count, ACLs etc. are all supposed to result in a change to the change attribute.<br>
<p>
In point of fact, AFS has a data version counter that is only bumped on content changes, but its semantics don&#x27;t really match what NFS needs.<br>

To be strictly fair, in an ideal world, we shouldn&#x27;t really need the i_version to tell us that the permissions, owner, link count, etc. have changed. All those values can be directly retrieved at low cost to the client+server.<br>
<p>
The objects that really do need to be tracked by i_version, or something equivalent, are the ones that can otherwise only be revalidated at a very high cost to the client and/or server. So typically that list would mean objects with unbounded size, such as file data, acls, and to a certain extent xattrs. Also data or metadata that might be unavailable when offlined in a hierarchical storage. If you wanted to revalidate your cache by directly comparing the cache to the object on the server, then the time it would take to do so is effectively unbounded.<br>
<p>
Now that said, the NFS spec was trying to make i_version easy to implement, so it went with the features that typically are tracked by ctime, so that the latter could be used in cases where the time resolution is good enough to track all changes.<br>

The ARM "big.LITTLE" architecture pairs two types of CPU — fast,
power-hungry processors and slow, efficient processors — into a single
package.  The result is a system that can efficiently run a wide variety of
workloads, but there is one little problem: the Linux kernel
currently lacks a scheduler that is 
able to properly spread a workload across multiple types of processors.
Two approaches to a solution to that problem are being pursued; a session
at the 2013 Linaro Connect Asia event reviewed the current status of the
more ambitious of the two.
<p>
LWN recently looked at the <a href="/Articles/539840/">big.LITTLE
switcher</a>, which pairs fast and slow processors and uses the CPU
frequency subsystem to switch between them.  The switcher approach has the
advantage of being relatively straightforward to get working, but it also
has a disadvantage: only half of the CPUs in the system can be doing useful
work at any given time.  It also is not yet posted for review or merging
into the mainline, though this posting is said to be planned for the near
future, after products using this code begin to ship.
<p>
The alternative approach has gone by the name "big LITTLE MP".  Rather than
play CPU frequency governor games, big LITTLE MP aims to solve the problem
directly by teaching the scheduler about the differences between processor
types and how to distribute tasks between them.  The big.LITTLE switcher
patch touches almost no files outside of the ARM architecture subtree; the
big LITTLE MP patch set, instead, is focused almost entirely on the
core scheduler code.  At Linaro Connect Asia, developers Vincent
Guittot and 
Morten Rasmussen described the current state of the patch set and the plans
for getting it merged in the (hopefully) not-too-distant future.
<p>
The big LITTLE MP patch set has recently seen a major refactoring effort.
The first version was strongly focused on the heterogeneous multiprocessing
(HMP) problem but, among other things, it is hard to get developers for the
rest of the kernel interested in HMP.  So the new patch set aims to improve

<a href="/Articles/541154/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2013/lc-asia/guittot-rasmussen-sm.jpg" alt="[Morten and
Vincent]" border=0 width=196 height=129 align="right" hspace=3></a>

scheduling results on all systems, even traditional SMP systems where all
CPUs are the same.  There is a patch set that is in internal review and
available on the <a href="http://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=arm/big.LITTLE/mp.git;a=summary">Linaro git server</a>.
Some parts have been publicly posted recently; soon the rest should be more
widely circulated as well.
<p>
The new patches are working well; for almost all workloads, their
performance is similar to that achieved with the old patch set.  The patches
were developed with a view toward simplicity: they affect a critical
kernel path, so they must be both simple and fast.  Some of the patches, 
fixes for the existing scheduler, have already been posted to the
mailing lists.  The rest try to augment the kernel's scheduler with three
simple rules:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Small tasks (those that only use small amounts of CPU time for brief
     periods) are not worth the trouble to schedule in any sophisticated
     way.  Instead, they should just be packed onto a single, slow core
     whenever they wake up, and kept there if at all possible.
<p>
<li> Load balancing should be concerned with the disposition of
     long-running tasks only; it should simply pass over the small tasks.
<p>
<li> Long-running tasks are best placed on the faster cores.
</ul>
<p>
Implementing these policies requires a set of a half-dozen patches.  One of
them is the "small-task packing" patch that was <a
href="/Articles/520857/">covered here</a> in October, 2012.  Another works
to expand the use of <a href="/Articles/531853/">per-entity load
tracking</a> (which is currently only enabled when control groups and the
CPU controller are being used) so that the per-task load values are
always available to the scheduler.  A further patch ensures that the
"LB_MIN" scheduler feature is 
turned on; LB_MIN (which defaults to "off" in mainline kernels) causes the
load balancer to 
pass over small tasks when working to redistribute the computing load on
the system, essentially implementing the second policy objective above.
<p>
After that, the patch set augments the scheduler with the concept of the
"capacity" of each CPU; the unloaded capacity is essentially the clock speed of the
processor.  The load balancer is tweaked to migrate processes
to the CPU with the largest available capacity.  This task is complicated
by the fact that a CPU's capacity may not be a constant value; realtime
scheduling, in particular, can "steal" capacity away from a CPU to give to
realtime-priority tasks.  Scheduler domains also need to be tuned for the
big.LITTLE environment with an eye toward reducing the periodic load
balancing work that needs to be done.
<p>
The final piece is not yet complete; it is called "scheduling invariance."
Currently, the "load" put on the system by a process is a function of the
amount of time that process spends running on the CPU.  But if some CPUs
are faster than others, the same process could end up with radically
different load values depending on which CPU it is actually running on.
That is suboptimal; the actual amount of work the process needs to do is
the same in either case, and varying load values can cause the scheduler to
make poor decisions.  For now, the problem is likely to be solved by scaling
the scheduler's 
load calculations by a constant value associated with each processor.
Processes running on a CPU that is ten times faster than another will
accumulate load ten times more quickly.
<p>
Even then, the load calculations are not perfect for the HMP scheduling
problem because they are scaled by the process's priority.  A high-priority
task that runs briefly can look like it is generating as much load as a
low-priority task that runs for long periods, but the scheduler may want to
place those processes in different ways.  The best solution to this problem
is not yet clear.
<p>
A question from the audience had to do with testing: how were the
developers testing their scheduling decisions?  In particular, was the <a
href="/Articles/487701/">Linsched</a> testing framework being used?  The
answer is that no, Linsched is not being used.  It has not seen much
development work since it was posted for the 3.3 kernel, so it does not
work with current kernels.  Perhaps more importantly, its task
representation is relatively simple; it is hard to present it with
something resembling a real-world Android workload.  It is easier, in the
end, to simply monitor a real kernel with an actual Android workload and
see how well it performs.
<p>
The plan seems to be to post a new set of big LITTLE MP patches in the near
future with an eye toward getting them upstream.  The developers are a
little concerned about that; getting reviewer attention for these patches
has proved to be difficult thus far.  Perhaps persistence and a more
general focus will help them to get over that obstruction, clearing the way
for proper scheduling on heterogeneous multiprocessor systems in the
not-too-distant future.

HMP reminds me of the load balancing problem in SSI clustering.  IIRC, the scheduling/load distribution solution that eventually worked best was based on a kind of market/economy model.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;[T]he problem is likely to be solved by scaling the scheduler's load calculations by a constant value associated with each processor. Processes running on a CPU that is ten times faster than another will accumulate load ten times more quickly.</font><br>
<p>
Faster isn't the goal here. Efficiency is the goal, so a scaling based on the relative efficiency of the 'big' or 'LITTLE' core should fit better with improving battery life.<br>
<p>
For example, a core which runs at 600MHz and consumes 0.3 watts with a bogoMIPS of 1 might have a measurement of 200 mega-ops-per-joule and you'd compare it to a core that runs at 1600MHz and consumes 12 watts with a bogoMIPS of 4 (so has 533 1/3 mega-ops per joule). In a race-to-idle scenario, it's obvious where to schedule the work, but in a long-runnning work scenario there may be certain workloads which you wouldn't leave on the LITTLE core because they break into blocks that can win the race-to-idle on the big core. Calculating where that line is will depend on the cost of moving the work between cores, but for a first approximation: how much time do you get on the big core before you've used a second's worth of energy in the LITTLE core? (Assuming it's no cost to start and stop cores, I think that's 1/40 second, so work that fits in intervals of &lt; 1/40 second is unexpectedly better off on the big core.<br>
<p>
Note: if these numbers aren't quite right, please do tell. :-)<br>

For efficiency, you want to direct the tasks that take the most cycles to the most efficient processors. Since you control which processor the task will run on in the future, your model should estimate how much energy it will take for each scheduling choice, so you're guessing the future cycle count for the task and multiplying by the energy cost for each processor; if you look at the past energy usage of the task, you're assuming that your past scheduling decisions are a good predictor of something in the future, but the point of the model is to make better decisions than your past ones were.<br>

It seems like much of their work could be applied very generally to ordinary multicore and multiprocessor systems, once different power states and frequencies are involved, since it is quite possible that you'll want some cores to be running in different states than others (or be powered down).  But perhaps you have to keep the frequency the same for all cores in a processor?<br>

Is it already known which approach is the code shipping on the first Samsung Galaxy S4 units going to use?<br>

From what I've read on LWN (no mobile here and I don't follow them closely enough to know specifics about individual models), the switching code will be shipping on the first units, as it's more mature due to both being simpler and the fact that there was less tweaking to do to the existing (cpufreq in that case) code to get something shippable.<br>
<p>
The HMP code is far more complex, and as the article states, the last pieces of the puzzle have yet to be fully hashed out, let alone written (the base cpufreq/switching code is I believe all written, they're at the last stae now), let alone corner-cased, fully debugged, with tunables tweaked.<br>
<p>
So we're talking weeks to ship switching, months, another mobile hardware generation at least, to ship HMP.<br>

I wonder if it would make sense to add additional scheduling classes (or options) for this sort of heterogenous processing environment?<br>
<p>
For example, some long-running application that want to run in the background while the system is idle might still want to run on a fast core (e.g. a background encoding task, which I want to finish ASAP while not disturbing or slowing down anything else), while others processes probably care less about finishing ASAP and could run on a slow core...<br>

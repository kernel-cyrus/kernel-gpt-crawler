           </div>
One does not normally expect to see significant changes to an important
internal memory-management mechanism in the time between the &#8209;rc7 prepatch
and the final release for a development cycle, but that is exactly what
happened just before 4.13 was released.  A regression involving the
memory-management unit (MMU) notifier mechanism briefly threatened to
delay this release, but a last-minute scramble kept 4.13 on
schedule and also resulted in a cleanup of that mechanism.
This seems like a good time to look at a mechanism that Linus
Torvalds called "<q>a badly designed mistake</q>" and how it was made
to be a bit less mistaken.
<p>
<h4>MMU Notifiers</h4>
<p>
A computer's memory-management unit handles the mapping between virtual and
physical addresses, tracks the presence of physical pages in memory,
handles memory-access permissions, and more.  Much of the work of the
memory-management subsystem is concerned with keeping the MMU properly
configured in response to workload changes on the system.  The details of
MMU management are nicely hidden, so that the rest of the kernel does not
(most of the time) have to worry about it, and neither does user space.
<p>
Things have changed over the last ten years or so in ways that have
rendered the concept of "the MMU" rather more fuzzy.  The initial driver of
this change
was virtualization; a mechanism like KVM must ensure that the host and the
guest's view of the MMU are consistent.  That typically involves managing a
set of shadow page tables within the guest.  More recently, other devices
have appeared on the memory bus with their own views of memory; graphics
processing units (GPUs) have led this trend with technologies like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units">GPGPU</a>, but others exist as well.  To function
properly, these non-CPU MMUs must be updated when the memory-management
subsystem makes changes, but the memory-management code is not able (and
should not be able) to make changes directly within the subsystems that
maintain those other MMUs.
<p>
To address this problem, Andrea Arcangeli <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/cddb8a5c14aa89810b40495d94d3d2a0faee6619">added
the MMU notifier mechanism</a> during the 2.6.27 merge window in 2008.
This mechanism allows any subsystem to hook into memory-management operations and
receive a callback when changes are made to a process's page tables.  One
could envision a wide range of callbacks for swapping, protection changes,
etc., but the actual approach was simpler.  The main purpose of an MMU
notifier callback is to tell the interested subsystem that <i>something</i> has
changed with one or more pages; that subsystem should respond by simply
invalidating its own mapping for those pages.  The next time a fault occurs
on one of the affected pages, the mapping will be re-established,
reflecting the new state of affairs.
<p>
There are a few ways of signaling the need for invalidation, though,
starting with the <tt>invalidate_page()</tt> callback:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*invalidate_page)(struct mmu_notifier *mn, struct mm_struct *mm,
			    unsigned long address);
</pre>
<p>
This callback can be invoked after the page-table entry for the page at
<tt>address</tt> in the address space indicated by <tt>mm</tt> has been
removed, but while the page itself still exists.  That is not the only
notification mechanism, though; larger operations can be
signaled with:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*invalidate_range_start)(struct mmu_notifier *mn, struct mm_struct *mm,
				   unsigned long start, unsigned long end);
    void (*invalidate_range_end)(struct mmu_notifier *mn, struct mm_struct *mm,
				 unsigned long start, unsigned long end);
</pre>
<p>
In this case, <tt>invalidate_range_start()</tt> is called while all pages
in the affected range are still mapped; no more mappings for pages in the
region should be added in the secondary MMU after the call.  When the
unmapping is complete and the pages have been freed,
<tt>invalidate_range_end()</tt> is called to allow any necessary cleanup to
be done.
<p>
Finally, there is also:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*invalidate_range)(struct mmu_notifier *mn, struct mm_struct *mm,
			     unsigned long start, unsigned long end);
</pre>
<p>
This callback is invoked when a range of pages is actually being unmapped.
It can be called between calls to <tt>invalidate_range_start()</tt> and
<tt>invalidate_range_end()</tt>, but it can also be called independently of
them in some situations.  One might wonder why both
<tt>invalidate_page()</tt> and <tt>invalidate_range()</tt> exist and,
indeed, that is where the trouble started.
<p>
<h4>The end of invalidate_page()</h4>
<p>
In late August, Adam Borowski <a href="/Articles/732954/">reported</a>
that he was getting warnings from the 4.13-rc kernel when using KVM,
followed by the quick demise of the host system.  Others had been
experiencing similar strangeness, including a related crash that seemed to
be tied to the out-of-memory handler.  After testing and bisection, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/aac2fea94f7a">this commit</a>, fixing
another bug, was identified as the culprit.
<p>
The problem came down to a difference between the
<tt>invalidate_page()</tt> and <tt>invalidate_range()</tt> callbacks: the
former is allowed to sleep, while the latter cannot.  The offending commit
was trying to fix a problem where <tt>invalidate_page()</tt> was called
with a spinlock held — a context where sleeping is not allowed — by calling
<tt>invalidate_range()</tt> instead.  But, as Arcangeli <a
href="/Articles/732956/">pointed out</a>, that will not lead to joy, since
not all users implement <tt>invalidate_range()</tt>; it is necessary to
call <tt>invalidate_range_start()</tt> and <tt>invalidate_range_end()</tt>
instead.
<p>
The real fix turned out to not be quite so simple, though.  Among other
things, the fact that <tt>invalidate_page()</tt> can sleep makes it
fundamentally racy.  It cannot be called while the page-table spinlock
affecting the page to be invalidated is held, meaning that the page-table
entry can change before or during the call.  This sort of issue is why
Torvalds <a href="/Articles/732957/">complained about the MMU notifiers in
general</a> and stated that they simply should not be able to sleep at
all.  But, as Jérôme Glisse <a href="/Articles/732958/">pointed out</a>,
some use cases absolutely require the ability to sleep:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	There is no way around sleeping if we ever want to support thing
	like GPU. To invalidate page table on GPU you need to schedule
	commands to do so on GPU command queue and wait for the GPU to
	signal that it has invalidated its page table/tlb and caches.
	<p>
	We had this discussion before. Either we want to support all the
	new fancy GPGPU, AI and all the API they rely on or we should tell
	them sorry guys not on linux.
</div>
<p>
Torvalds later <a href="/Articles/732959/">backed down</a> a little, making
a distinction between two cases.  Anything dealing with virtual addresses
and the <tt>mm_struct</tt> structure can sleep, while anything dealing with
specific pages and page-table entries cannot.  Thus, the
<tt>invalidate_range_start()</tt> and <tt>invalidate_range_end()</tt>
callbacks, which deal with ranges of addresses and are called without any
spinlocks held, can sleep.  But <tt>invalidate_range()</tt> and
<tt>invalidate_page()</tt> cannot.
<p>
That, in turn, suggests that <tt>invalidate_page()</tt> is fundamentally
wrong by design.  After some discussion, Torvalds <a
href="/Articles/732960/">concluded</a> that the best thing to do would be
to remove it entirely.  But, as the bug that started the discussion showed,
replacing it with <tt>invalidate_range()</tt> calls is not a complete
solution to the problem.  To make things work again in all settings,
including those that need to be able to sleep, the
<tt>invalidate_range()</tt> calls must always be surrounded by calls to
<tt>invalidate_range_start()</tt> and <tt>invalidate_range_end()</tt>.
<p>
Glisse quickly <a href="/Articles/732610/">implemented that idea</a> and,
after a round of review, his patch set was fast-tracked into the 4.13 kernel three
days before its release.  So, as a last-minute surprise, the
<tt>invalidate_page()</tt> MMU notifier is gone; out-of tree modules that
used it will not work with 4.13 until they are updated.  It is rare to see
a change of this nature merged so late in the development cycle, but the
alternative was to release with real regressions and the confidence in the
fix was high.  With luck, this fix will prevent similar problems from
occurring in the future.
<p>
There is still one problem related to MMU notifiers in the 4.13 kernel,
though: it turns out that the <a
href="/Articles/668126/#reaper">out-of-memory reaper</a>, which tries to
recover memory more quickly from processes that have been killed in an
out-of-memory situation, does not invoke the notifiers.  That, in turn, can
lead to corruption on systems where notifiers are in use and memory runs
out.  Michal Hocko has responded with <a href="/Articles/732963/">a
patch</a> to disable the reaper on processes that have MMU notifiers
registered.  He took that approach because the notifier implementations are
out of the memory-management subsystem's control, and he worried about what
could happen in an out-of-memory situation, where the system is already in
a difficult state.  This patch has not been merged as of this writing, but
something like it will likely get in soon and find its way into the stable
trees.
<p>
Notifier callbacks have a bit of a bad name in the kernel community.
Kernel developers like to know exactly what will happen in response to a
given action, and notifiers tend to obscure that information.  As can be
seen in the original bug and the reaper case, notifiers may also not be
called consistently throughout a subsystem.  But they can be hard to do
without, especially as the complexity of the system grows.  Sometimes the
best that can be done is to be sure that the semantics of the notifiers are
clear from the outset, and to be willing to make fundamental changes when
the need becomes clear — even if that happens right before a release.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wonder if this is, or would be a mechanism to implement the system side of the "managed memory" on GPU for GPGPU purposes, which (for devices that support it) make GPU memory support on-demand paging and on-demand copy from CPU memory. This is an extension of unified virtual memory addressing for GPU; the driver side of this "managed memory" appeared, if I remember it correctly, in CUDA 8.0.<br>

Yep this is exactly one use case for it. It requires that the GPU have an MMU of it's own, though, which most do these days - the idea being that when the kernel changes a mapping allocated to a GPU, the GPU driver is notified, makes the appropriate changes so it'll fault in a similar way. When the GPU runs over that memory region, it can then trap into the GPU driver, and the GPU driver can then cause the MM subsystem to pull the memory back in.<br>
<p>
I have some code I wrote half a decade ago that does it with very early MMU notifiers and it somewhat works.. but it's not really covered by the IOMMU on the GPU I chose. ARM SMMU, for example, have a "stall fault mode" which will block a transaction from the GPU from getting to the interconnect while a translation is fixed up by the kernel.<br>
<p>
Actually, what we're talking about here is "uncore MMUs" in a very generic way, really, rather than GPUs in particular.<br>

Due to maintainers on vacation, the patch is wrong for KVM. (The code from the invalidate page callback should have been moved to the range end callback). Oh well, we'll fix it for 4.13.1...<br>

Yes, it is just the part that recognized the APIC access page's address in kvm_arch_mmu_invalidate_page and asked the vCPUs to update the physical address. That must be placed in one of the range-based callbacks. I need to review your patch more closely first though, I am not actually sure it's range_end.<br>

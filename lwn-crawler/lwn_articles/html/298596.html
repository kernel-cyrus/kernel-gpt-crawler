           <hr>
LWN's <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2008/">2008 Kernel Summit coverage</a>
</div>
The first day of the 2008 kernel summit concluded with two sessions
dedicated to the quality of our 
kernels and the process used to produce them.  Arjan van de Ven started off
talking about the data acquired by the <a
href="http://kerneloops.org/">Kerneloops project</a>.  In a short period of
time, Arjan has accumulated information from tens of thousands of kernel
crashes and warnings.  From that data, he is able to draw some conclusions
about how the kernel fails and how well the developers are doing at fixing
problems.
<p>
Initially, Kerneloops worked by grabbing oops reports from the kernel
mailing lists.  Since then, a number of distributors have added facilities
to find oops tracebacks in the kernel logs and ship them off to the project
(after obtaining confirmation from the user, of course).  This tool is now
the source of the vast majority (99%) of the oops reports in the system.
One of the things Arjan noted is that many of the biggest problems
encountered by users are never reported on the kernel mailing lists; the
problem reports one sees there are not indicative of what users are
actually running into.
<p>

At any given time, the top ten bugs account for a full 60% of the reports;
the top 25 make up 70%.  So, while there still appear to be many ways to
make a kernel crash, most user problems are caused by a very small number
of bugs.  Fix those problems, and most users will see their troubles go
away.  At the other end of the scale, almost half of the bugs are
represented by a single report.  While some of those reports will be the
result of obscure timing-related issues, most of them are more likely to be
the result of hardware problems.  So a lot of the reported problems do not
really require any action from the developers.
<p>

A number of reported bugs result from the utrace code.  Utrace is an
out-of-tree tracing enhancement shipped by Fedora; it seems that, perhaps,
this code still isn't quite ready for prime time.  There's also quite a few
which are attributable to binary-only modules.
<p>

Linus asked how many developers get the occasional oops reports mailed out
by the project; maybe ten people raised their hands.  Linus would like to
see that report mailed to a lot more people, and the regression reports
too.  If this information got to more developers, perhaps more bugs would
get fixed.
<a name="regressions"></a>
<p>
<h3>Regressions</h3>
<p>
That was a natural point to move into a discussion of regressions led by
Rafael Wysocki.  Rafael put up a number of plots of regression counts and
associated fixes; by fitting a logarithmic function to regression reports
and a line to fixes, he was able to extrapolate the point where the two
curves intersect and, in theory, all regressions are fixed.  It turns out
that recent kernels have been released 1-3 weeks before this point is
reached.  According to his data, Rafael suggests that the optimal time to
release 2.6.27 would be in about three weeks.
<p>

One problem raised by Rafael was that fixes for regressions take far too
long to get into the mainline.  Some subsystem maintainers like to let
regression fixes sit in the linux-next tree for a while.  It was pointed
out, though, that presence in linux-next did not help find the original
regression, so there is unlikely to be any value in letting fixes age
there; they should, instead, go straight into the mainline.
<p>

Rafael also noted that some regressions attract no debugging effort at all;
it seems that nobody is interested in working on them.  It can be
disheartening for users to hear nothing about a reported regression at all;
somebody should at least tell them why the problem is not being worked on.
He also noted that regressions which have been bisected (to identify the
change which first caused the problem to happen) tend to get fixed much
more quickly.  The data from the bisection is undoubtedly useful, but the
real benefit probably comes from fingering the guilty party, who then feels
the need to get a fix in place.
<p>

Another thing Rafael pointed out is that we have a small core of dedicated
testers; most of our regressions are reported by a small, recurring group
of people.  Perhaps we could recruit some of those people to help with the
management of bugs.  They could track reports, get more information from
users, and harass maintainers to get fixes in place.  These people have
already shown a certain amount of dedication; giving them this kind of role
would let them expand the help they are able to give to the kernel
community. 
<p>
There was also some talk of trying to track the amount of test coverage the
kernel is receiving.  There could be some sort of mechanism set up, perhaps tied
into Fedora's "smolt" system, to report successful boots of the kernel on
specific hardware.  There are obvious privacy issues which would have to be
addressed, and the whole thing would take a certain amount of work.  It is
not clear that anybody feels this idea is important enough to put the
requisite amount of time into.
<p>


<h3>Release process</h3>
<p>
Matt Mackall asked a question: what would happen if we were to cut the
merge window down to one week - merging less code - and shorten the
development cycle to match?  With some discipline, maybe we could produce a
stable kernel release every six weeks.  Linus responded that he would love
to see this happen.  His main motivation was to reduce the size of the -rc1
releases, which have gotten quite big in recent development cycles.  A
smaller -rc1 would be easier to debug and should, hopefully, stabilize more
quickly.
<p>

Quite a bit of time went into discussing this idea.  The shorter merge
window was clearly worrisome to some developers who feel that the two-week
window is already painfully short.  Merging of trees with dependencies on
other trees would get harder.  It would also be harder to get good testing
coverage, since there would be less time for testers to play with each
release.  Some code simply takes a long time to fix; it's not clear that
this stabilization could be compressed into the shorter cycle.  There would
have to be some higher barriers to ensure that code which does get in
through a particular merge window is truly ready.
<p>

Andrew Morton jumped in with a complaint about code that shows up in the
mainline, but which has never made an appearance in linux-next or the -mm
tree.  He acknowledged that this would always happen, but asserted that it
should be an extraordinary event.  The guilty subsystem maintainer, he
says, should at least make excuses for doing this.  Much of the problem, it
was said, comes from vendors who show up with last-minute patches that they
want to see merged.  The answer was to tell them that it is too late, that
the merge window is for subsystem maintainers, not for vendors.
<p>
Getting back to the shorter cycle, Linus pointed out that it would require
a great deal of care from everybody involved, especially the first time
around.  It would require a development cycle which does not start with a
lot of pending code - a problem, since there is always a big pile of
patches waiting by the time the merge window opens.
<p>
Al Viro suggested only merging a subset of subsystem trees in any
development cycle, only accepting trivial patches from the rest.  James
Bottomley responded that, if his trees lost out in a given development
cycle, his definition of "trivial" would surely change.  Another suggestion
was to simply merge linux-next, but Linus did not like that.  He goes out
of his way to limit the amount of code he merges each day as a favor to the
people to test the nightly repository snapshots.  Pulling in all of
linux-next would make that impossible.
Yet another option is to only pull trees for which the pull request is in
place before the merge window opens.  This idea seemed popular for a while.
<p>
Just about when it looked like a consensus for trying the idea was settling
into place, Matthew Wilcox stated that he didn't like it.  His work
involves tracking down performance issues, a process which can take quite a
bit of time.  A shortened development cycle would not allow the time needed
to get that work done.  Andrew Morton said that he saw no real point in the
change; it wasn't addressing any of our biggest problems, and we would lose
economies of scale in testing large numbers of changes.  Dave Airlie said
it would require testers to do twice as much work, dealing with -rc1
kernels twice as often.  Ben Herrenschmidt worried that the tighter
deadlines would make developers rush, leading to lower-quality code.  And
Dave Jones said that changing the cycle would make future kernel releases
less predictable, making communications with vendors and customers harder.
<p>
These comments essentially ended the discussion of the shorter development
cycle idea.  In the end, concluded Linus, it was better not to mess with
something which isn't completely broken.  So nothing may have come with it,
but it was an interesting exploration of how things could be done
differently.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

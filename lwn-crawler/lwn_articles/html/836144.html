           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 6, 2020</br>
           </div>
The <tt>kmap()</tt> interface in the kernel is a bit of a strange beast.
It only exists to overcome the virtual addressing limitations of 32-bit
CPUs, but it affects code across the kernel and has side effects on 64-bit
machines as well.  A recent discussion on the handling of preemption within
the kernel identified a number of problems in need of attention, <a
href="/Articles/831678/#highmem">one of which was the <tt>kmap()</tt>
API</a>.  Now, an extension to this API called <tt>kmap_local()</tt> is
being proposed to address some of the problems; it signals another step in
the kernel community's slow move away from supporting 32-bit machines as
first-class citizens.

<p>
<h4>Why we have <tt>kmap()</tt></h4>
<p>
A 32-bit processor will, unsurprisingly, use 32-bit pointers, which limits
the amount of memory that can be addressed to 4GB.  The resulting 4GB
address space is split between user space and the kernel, with the kernel
getting 1GB in the most common configurations; that space holds the
kernel's code and data, memory-mapped I/O areas, and the "direct map" that
gives the kernel access to physical memory.  The direct map clearly cannot
address a lot of memory; once the kernel's other needs are taken care of,
there is room for significantly less than 1GB of mappings to physical
memory.
<p>
As a result, any system with 1GB or more of physical memory will have to
be managed without a direct mapping to some of that memory.  The memory
that lies above the range that can be directly mapped is called "high
memory"; on many systems, most of the installed memory is high memory.
User space can use high memory without noticing any difference, but the
kernel side is a bit more complicated.  Whenever the kernel must access a
high-memory page (to zero out a page prior to giving it to user space, for
example), it must first create a temporary mapping for that page.  The
<tt>kmap()</tt> interface exists to manage these mappings.
<p>
The <tt>kmap()</tt> function itself will map a given page into the kernel's
address space, returning a pointer that can now be used to access the
page's contents.  Mappings created this way are expensive, though.  They
consume address space, and mapping changes must be propagated across all
the CPUs of the system, which is costly.  This work is necessary if a
mapping must last for a relatively long time, but the bulk of high-memory mappings in
the kernel are short-lived and only used in one place; the cost of
<tt>kmap()</tt> is mostly wasted in such cases.
<p>
Thus, the <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> API was added as a way of avoiding this
cost.  It, too, will map a high-memory page into the kernel's address
space, but with some differences.  It uses one of a small set of address
slots for the mapping, and that mapping is only valid on the CPU where it
is created.  This design implies that code holding one of these mappings
must run in atomic context (thus the name <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt>); if it
were to sleep or be moved to another CPU, confusion and data corruption
would be an almost certain result.  Thus, whenever code running in kernel
space creates an atomic mapping, it can no longer be preempted or migrated,
and it is not allowed to sleep, until all atomic mappings have been
released.
<p>
On 64-bit systems, calls to <tt>kmap()</tt> and <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> have
no real work to do; a  64-bit address space is more than sufficient to
address the memory one might expect to see installed in any real-world
system (for now), so all of physical memory appears in the direct map.  But
calling <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> will disable preemption anyway, mostly as a
debugging tool.  It is a way of ensuring that code that sleeps while
holding an atomic mapping will generate an error on 64-bit systems, meaning
that such bugs are much more likely to be found before they show up on some
32-bit configuration that developers do not test.
<p>
Disabling preemption is a red flag for realtime developers, who have worked
hard for years to ensure that any given CPU can be preempted by a
higher-priority task at any time.  Each of the hundreds of
<tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> call sites in the kernel creates a non-preemptable
section that could be the source of unwanted latency.  The last time this
subject came up, there was a brief discussion of removing support for high
memory from the kernel entirely; this move would simplify a lot of code and
would certainly be popular, but it would also break support for existing
systems that are still being shipped with new kernels.  So high-memory
support cannot be ripped out of the kernel quite yet.
<p>
<h4>Shifting the cost</h4>
<p>
Developers are thus left in the position of having to find a second-best
solution to the problem; that solution is likely to be the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201103092712.714480842@linutronix.de/"><tt>kmap_local()</tt>
patch set</a> from Thomas Gleixner.  It provides a set of new functions similar to
<tt>kmap_atomic()</tt>, but without the need to disable preemption.  The
new functions are:
<p>
<pre>
    void *kmap_local_page(struct page *page);
    void *kmap_local_page_prot(struct page *page, pgprot_t prot);
    void *kmap_local_pfn(unsigned long pfn);
    void kunmap_local(void *addr);
</pre>
<p>
The first two variants take a pointer to the <tt>page</tt> structure
corresponding to the page of interest and return the address where the page
is mapped; the second also allows the caller to specify the page
protections to be applied to the mapping.  If the caller has a page-frame
number rather than a <tt>page</tt> structure, <tt>kmap_local_pfn()</tt> can
be used.  Regardless of how the mapping was created, it is destroyed with
<tt>kunmap_local()</tt>.
<p>
Internally, these mappings are implemented in the same way as
<tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> — but that implementation is significantly changed
by this patch set.  In current kernels, each architecture has its own
implementation, but almost all of the code is the same; Gleixner cleaned
out this duplication and coalesced the implementations into a single,
cross-architecture 
one.  As a result, the patch set deletes over 600&nbsp;lines of code while
adding new functionality.
<p>
Once the common implementation is in place, the management of the slots
used for short-term mappings changes.  In current kernels, they are stored
in a per-CPU data structure; they are thus shared by all threads that run
on the same CPU.  That is one of the reasons why preemption cannot be
allowed when holding an atomic mapping; a running process and the process
that preempts it might both try to use the same slots, with generally
displeasing results.  In the new scheme, the mappings are stored in the
<tt>task_struct</tt> structure; they are thus unique to each thread.
<p>
The actual page-table entries that (on 32-bit systems) implement the
mappings cannot be per-thread, though, so something more will have to be
done to safely enable preemption in this scheme.  At context-switch time,
the new code looks to see whether either the outgoing or the incoming task
has active local mappings; if so, those for the outgoing task are torn down and
the incoming task's are reestablished.  This work will slow down context
switches a bit but, as Gleixner noted: "<q>That's obviously
slow, but highmem is slow anyway</q>".
<p>
Local page mappings are still only established on the local CPU, meaning
that a process holding such mappings cannot be migrated without asking for
trouble.  Thus, while preemption remains enabled when kernel code creates a local
mapping, migration from one CPU to another is disabled.  It's worth noting
that current kernels don't have the machinery to disable migration in this
way; that is a feature that has been limited to the realtime kernels so
far.  Peter Zijlstra has been working on <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201023101158.088940906@infradead.org/">a
migration-disable implementation</a> for the general case that has not yet
been merged; it is obviously a prerequisite for the <tt>kmap_local()</tt>
work.
<p>
Once everything is in place, the only difference between
<tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> and <tt>kmap_local()</tt> will be the execution context
when holding a mapping.  Atomic mappings still disable preemption, while
local mappings only disable migration.  Otherwise, the two mapping types
are identical.  That leads to an obvious question: why not just switch
everybody to <tt>kmap_local()</tt>?  That is indeed the long-term plan, but
there is a little hitch: some <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> callers almost
certainly depend on preemption being disabled, perhaps without the
developer even being aware of it.  So every one of hundreds of call sites
will need to be audited and converted, one by one.
<p>
That work can be expected to take a while, but there should eventually be a
time when <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> is no longer used and can be removed from
the kernel.  The newer API preserves functionality for 32-bit systems, but
it shifts some of the cost toward those systems and away from the 64-bit
systems that dominate the computing landscape now.  It's not the removal of
high-memory support, but it is a sign that systems using high memory are
increasingly seen as a niche use case that will not be supported forever.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It may also be worth noting that Ira Weiny also has patches that affect kmap: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20201009195033.3208459-1-ira.weiny@intel.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20201009195033.3208459-1...</a><br>

He repurposes the kmap interface for supporting an entirely different feature. He&#x27;s taken a somewhat different approach, though.<br>

<p>
That&#x27;s kmap which is a different beast and his reasoning is that:<br>
<p>
  Attempt to change all the thread local kmap() calls to kmap_atomic() is not feasible<br>
<p>
But changing all the thread local kmap() calls to kmap_local() is feasible and only a burden for 32bit in the rare case that such a section is preempted.<br>

why not deprecate kmap_atomic() immediately by converting every current instance of it to kmap_local() + preempt disable?<br>
This will make sure there are no new users, and we can clean up preempt disable where it&#x27;s not needed one instance at a time.<br>

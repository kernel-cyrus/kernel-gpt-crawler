           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 8, 2011</br>
           </div>
Your editor has recently seen two keynote presentations on two continents
which, using two very different styles, conveyed the same message: the
centralization of the Internet and the services built on it has given
governments far too much control.  Both speakers called for an urgent
effort to decentralize the net at all levels, including the transport
level.  An Internet without centralized telecommunications infrastructure
can be hard to envision; when people try the term that usually comes out is
"mesh networking."  As it happens, the kernel has a mesh networking
implementation which made the move from the staging tree into the mainline
proper in 2.6.38.
<p>
Mesh networking, as its name implies, is meant to work via a large number
of short-haul connections without any sort of centralized control.  A
proper mesh network should configure itself dynamically, responding to the
addition and removal of nodes and changes in connectivity.  In a
well-functioning mesh, networking "just happens" without high-level
coordination; such a net should be quite hard to disrupt.  What the kernel
offers now falls somewhat short of that ideal, but it is a good
demonstration of how hard mesh networking can be.
<p>
The "Better Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Networking" (BATMAN) protocol is
described in <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wunderlich-openmesh-manet-routing-00">this
draft RFC</a>.  A BATMAN mesh is made up of a set of "originators" which
communicate via network interfaces - normal wireless interfaces, for
example.  Every so often, each originator sends out an "originator message"
(OGM) as a broadcast to all of its neighbors to tell the world that it
exists.  Each neighbor is supposed to note the presence of the originator
and forward the message onward via a broadcast of its own.  Thus, over
time, all nodes in the mesh should see the OGM, possibly via multiple
paths, and thus each node will know (1)&nbsp;that it can reach the
originator, and (2)&nbsp;which of its neighbors has the best path to that
originator.  Each node maintains a routing table listing every other node
it has ever heard of and the best neighbor by which to reach each one.
<p>
This protocol has the advantage of building and maintaining the routing
tables on the fly; no central coordination is needed.  It should also find
near-optimal routes to each.  If a node goes away, the routing tables will
reconfigure themselves to function in its absence.  There is also no node
in the network which has a complete view of how the mesh is built; nodes
only know who is out there and the best next hop.  This lack of knowledge
should add to the security and robustness of the mesh.

<p>
Nodes with a connection to the regular Internet can set a bit in their OGMs
to advertise that fact; that allows others without such a connection to
route packets to and from the rest of the world.
<p>
The original BATMAN protocol uses UDP for the OGM messages.  That design
allows routing to be handled with the normal kernel routing tables, but it
also imposes a couple of unfortunate constraints: nodes must obtain an IP
address from somewhere before joining the mesh, and the protocol is tied to
IPv4.  The <a
href="http://www.open-mesh.org/wiki/batman-adv">BATMAN-adv</a> protocol
found in the Linux kernel has changed a few things to get around these
problems, making it a rather more flexible solution.  BATMAN-adv works
entirely at the link layer, exchanging non-UDP OGMs directly with
neighboring nodes.  The routing table is maintained within a special
virtual network device, which makes all nodes on the mesh appear to be
directly connected via that virtual interface.  Thus the system can join
the mesh before it has a 
network address, and any protocol can be run over the mesh.
<p>
BATMAN-adv removes some of the limitations found in BATMAN, but readers who
have gotten this far will likely be thinking of the limitations that
remain.  The flooding of broadcast OGMs through the net can only scale so
far before a significant amount of bandwidth is consumed by network
overhead.  The protocol trims OGMs which are obviously not of interest -
those which describe a route which is known to be worse than others, for
example - but the OGM traffic will still be significant if the mesh gets
large.  The routing tables will also grow, since every node must keep track
of every other node in existence.  The overhead for these tables is
probably manageable for a mesh of 1,000 nodes; it is probably hopeless for
1,000,000 nodes.  Mobile devices - which are targeted by this protocol -
are especially likely to suffer as the table gets larger.
<p>
Security is also a concern in this kind of network.  Simple
bandwidth-consuming denial of service attacks would seem relatively
straightforward.  Sending bogus OGMs could cause the size of routing tables
to explode or disrupt the routing within the mesh.  A more clever attack
could force traffic to route through a hostile node, enabling
man-in-the-middle exploits.  And so on.  The draft RFC quickly mentions
some of these issues, but it seems clear that security has not been a major
design goal.
<p>
So it would seem clear that BATMAN-adv, while interesting, is not the
solution to the problem of an overly-centralized network.  It could be a
useful way to extend connectivity through a building or small neighborhood,
but it is not meant to operate on a large scale or in an overtly hostile
environment.  The bigger problem is a hard one to solve, to say the least.
The experience 
gained with protocols like BATMAN-adv may will prove valuable in the search
for that solution, but there is clearly some work to be done still.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Content-centric_networking">Content-centric networking</a> seems well suited for mesh networks, where instead of futilely attempting online communication across a network in continual flux, static information is opportunistically exchanged, with some ranking/reputability system used to decide which content to publish, and which to receive. Something closer to FidoNet than the Internet.

<p>
Another benefit is the possibility of not requiring battery-powered devices to be permanently awake in order to serve as router for other nodes in the mesh. It's easy to imagine a scheme where devices only wake for a specific window every few minutes to handshake with any interesting neighbour, synchronized to the device's current best idea of time (something that could even be derived from the mesh during initialization).

<p>
While it wouldn't allow you to watch every desired YouTube clip, in a scenario where freedom of information was threatened, such a network might be very effective for transmission of important information. One aspect that isn't clear would be how a user would configure their (space constrained) mobile device with a policy to filter the exchanged data, e.g. the ability to select regional news while excluding pornography, sports, or politically motivated content.

<p>
I think given software with the right UI, and some motivating application, technology already exists today in millions of pockets worldwide to make a network like this reality.

I think the desire to filter the content their device transfers is likely to be harmful to the intended use of the system; in a scenario where freedom of information is threatened, participants would want to carry state TV and sports in addition to regional news so that it's plausible (and even likely) that the reason for participating is actually to follow the latest football matches, not protest the government. That also means that the people who actually just want the latest sports aren't able to avoid spreading the region news, and everyone cares about football, while (in the situation where freedom of information is threatened and matters) only a significant minority of the population wants to protest the government.<br>

The ever increasing mobile data speeds are causing an ever increasing need for more bandwidth by the Mobile Operators. This can only be met by moving up in frequency. We now see 2.6 GHz being deployed for LTE mobiles. What band do we use next? 3.5 GHz and 5 GHz are both possibilities but both these bands have very limited coverage. The answer at some point will be mesh networks.<br>
<p>
The focus on mesh in the Kernel is timely. One problem that needs to be solved is the time it takes for route discovery. If we do end up with "mobile mesh" then vehicles will be one of the most important nodes (large power source with decent antennas at a good height). The problem is that most of these nodes move at significant speed (when compared with the size of the mesh cell at 3 GHz and above).<br>
<p>
Low latency rebroadcast of messages or some smarter route discovery algorithm need to be priorities if mesh is to work in the next generation of mobile networks or beyond (5G or 6G).<br>

Seems some learning from p2p networks like Gnutella could be used, where some nodes become "supernodes", used to maintain routing details for nodes further afield, whilst other nodes just maintain routing to nearby supernodes. When one node needs to talk to another, it can query its nearest supernode(s) for this information, and then cache it locally.<br>
<p>
Maybe :-)<br>

In the book "Rainbows End" by Vernor Vinge, the protagonists<br>
_sometimes_ manage their mesh manually, adding and removing nodes<br>
by explicit user request. I wonder if that may be a sensible approach<br>
in mobile devices managed by their users, like the mobile phones.<br>

Kernel Summit coverage</a>.
</td></tr></table>

The second day of the 2004 Kernel Summit began with the "customer panel,"
being a set of presentations from large commercial Linux users on their
needs and wishes.  The number of presenters was smaller than planned; a
couple of people found themselves unable to attend.  The discussion easily
expanded to fill the available time, however.
<p>

Daniel Padwa is a technical manager at Goldman Sachs.  This company uses a
lot of computers: they have over 20,000 Windows desktops, 9000 Solaris
servers, and around 2400 Linux servers.  The bulk of the Linux machines are
organized into compute farms running Monte Carlo simulations and such; they
run a "hacked 2.4 kernel."  There's a few hundred RHEL systems as well.
Daniel expects the number of Linux systems to grow by an order of magnitude
over the next few years - even though the company has no interest in
desktop Linux systems.
<p>

Most of the problems Goldman Sachs has with Linux happen above the kernel
level; they include things like Java support, dealing with independent
system vendors, configuration management, etc.  They do, however, run into
kernel-level problems as well.
The biggest of these problems, by far, is storage.  Goldman Sachs runs some
150 storage arrays adding up to about 1200 terabytes of space.  Storage on
this scale is expensive and a challenge to manage.  Some of the issues that
come up are:
<p>
<b>Multipath support</b>.  Numerous multipath implementations exist for
     Linux; some are free, and some proprietary.  It would be nice, says
     Daniel, if there were one which "just works."  In many cases,
     proprietary drivers are unavoidable.
<p>
<b>Real-time, synchronous, remote mirroring</b> is a big deal.  Financial
     institutions need serious disaster recovery plans in place.  In
     practice, these plans include storage arrays which are mirrored, in
     real time, at a remote location.  When a SCSI write to the local array
     completes, the system knows that it has also been committed to disk at
     the mirror site, many miles away.  This mirroring makes up-to-the-second recovery
     possible, but it also adds a lot of latency to write operations.
     Maintaining performance then becomes a problem.
<p>
<b>Driver interface stability</b>.  When the driver API changes, proprietary
     drivers must be changed and, often, recertified.  So the oft-heard
     request that internal APIs be made more stable, especially during a
     stable kernel series, was raised again.
<P>

Driver interface issues are often best solved by putting the drivers into
the mainline kernel.  Free drivers tend to get fixed when an interface
changes; proprietary drivers do not.  Goldman Sachs understands that well,
and has been pushing its vendors to release their drivers.  In other words,
big, commercial customers with no "free software" agenda are beginning to
realize that their interests are best served by free drivers.  <i>That</i>
is a crucial turning point which should help vendors understand that
releasing their drivers will help their business.

<p>
<b>Device name stability</b> is also an issue.  Goldman Sachs runs with a
great many disks installed; it is a real pain when a hardware change causes
all of those disks to be renamed.  

<p>
A few issues beyond storage were raised; for example,
<b>crash dumps</b> were requested as a "key" feature for tracking down
problems.  When 
you have thousands of systems, crashes will be a regular occurrence even if
the systems are, individually, quite reliable.  Crash dumps help in
identifying patterns 
and recurring issues; these problems cannot be easily tracked down without
this facility.  The network dump scheme shipped by Red Hat is a step in the
right direction, but it does not work well in a large network; what's
really needed is a reliable dump mechanism which dumps to local disk.
<p>

<b>Thread support</b>.  The instability in the next generation pthread
library has been a problem, especially for users running the "2.4&nbsp;1/2" kernels
shipped by certain distributors.  In many areas, heavily threaded
applications are the norm, and they need to be well supported.
<p>
The Linux scheduler could still use some work as well.  What some users
really want is a process-fair scheduler which would group all threads in
one task together and have them contend as a unit with the other tasks on
the system.  Scheduling each thread independently does not yield the
results they need.  The class-based kernel resource management work
currently in progress may help with this.

<p>
<b>NFS</b>, a traditional target of complaints for many years.  The Linux
NFS server is still not quite stable enough.  The client works better, but
still needs work, especially in its ability to recover from server
failures. 
<p>

Finally, <b>long development periods</b> are a problem.  It can take years
for features added to a development kernel to find their way into supported
distributions.  There is also a lack of predictability in the kernel
development process; nobody really knows when a particular kernel will
stabilize.  When particular features do stabilize, it would be nice to mark
them as such (and then live up to it) so that vendors and users know that
those features are now safe.

<p>
Daniel also conveyed some confusion about how best to work with the kernel
community.  He is willing to dedicate some resources to fix SCSI layer
problems, for example, but he is not looking to hire a SCSI developer for
the long term.  High-end users like Goldman Sachs have a hard time finding
ways to help the community make the kernel better. 

<p>

The other customer at the panel was Amazon.com, represented by Willie
Lewis.  He stated that Amazon is predominantly a Linux operation; most
parts of the organization had been switched over by last year.  At least,
on the operational side; he did not mention desktop deployments.  Amazon
runs a large number of big database clusters and NFS servers, all over the
world.  
<p>

Willie also mentioned predictability problems with kernel development.
There may well be a patch out there which solves one of his problems
nicely, but he never really knows if that patch will be maintained into the
future.  Picking up new code, thus, is a bit of a leap of faith.
<p>

Tracking down problems can be difficult.  Crash dumps would help, as would
some sort of (secure!) remote diagnostics mechanism.

<p>
Willie did not mention it, but a developer sent by a large database company
pointed out that asynchronous I/O was crucial for what Amazon is doing.
Linus was unimpressed; he wants to actually <i>see</i> AIO applications,
and that means seeing the source.  If Amazon's applications are so
important, it is worth their while to push some of the code out into the
world; it will help to ensure that the needed features will still work
tomorrow. 

<p>
The customer panel was a useful addition to the summit.  It is good to hear
about the problems encountered by people trying to actually use Linux in
interesting ways.  Of course, this format is better suited to the problems
of large companies than, say, little old ladies who are trying to organize
their budgets.  Even with that flaw, this sort of feedback path can only
help to make the kernel better.

      Putting drivers in the kernel does *NOT* fix the actual problem.  Even with GPL drivers, the interface instability makes some serious pain for users.  Currently, if you want to use a new piece of hardware that didn't have a driver in the kernel at the time your OS was put together, you need to upgrade your kernel.  That can be a *serious* PITA, especially when you already have a customized kernel.  Getting a new kernel built, tested, and installed properly can be a big undertaking, and that's for a very experienced Linux user; Mom 'n' Pop are never going to be able to handle it.  <p>Vendors generally don't release new kernels for older distros solely for the sake of new drivers, either, because of all the time and QA problems listed above.<p>You also run into the problem where a driver is needed during install.  In this case, you not only have to make a custom kernel, but manage to get it usable during install as well, usually by making a customized boot disk.  It's a total and complete PITA.<p>At least having a stable API would make it possible for users to download and compile drivers (hopefully with a nice GUI to automatically do the work; even if you know how, why should you have to waste the time doing it manually when it's avoidable?) and have them Just Work(tm) with no kernel updates or other dangerous/difficult operations.  You can't even do this with GPL drivers right now.  Having a stable ABI would make it possible for hardware vendors to put Linux drivers on media with the hardware for use during installation.  Again, even if the drivers _are_ GPL, they can't do this currently.

      So I think you're saying that including a device driver in the Linux kernel solves the problem of future API changes, but doesn't solve the problem of past API changes.  I.e. a device vendor who ships a driver for today's Linux would be shielded from any incompatibility with tomorrow's Linux, but there still wouldn't be any drivers for yesterday's Linux.
<p>
People usually think of the API problem as being one of future API changes, since there's nothing a device vendor can do about those, whereas the vendor could, if he really wanted to, ship drivers for past versions of the API.
<p>
But I suppose the fact that vendors don't take the trouble to ship drivers that work with all historical Linuxes is also a good reason never to change (incompatibly) the API.

</PRE>

Hardly.  That would suggest that because people outside our sphere of influence (they're not in the kernel) don't do work with the kernel, that they should have significant influence on kernel design and development (freezing the APIs).  That way lies madness.

The kernel (through kcompat.h) and projects like DKMS make it easier for vendors to backport their work to earlier kernels, even those with different APIs than the current kernels.  Also, it's a matter of timing.  If drivers are merged in early enough, then there's less need to do backports, yes?  That can't always happen (new hardware does become available, and users of that hardware want support on historical kernels), so good programming practices like kcompat.h and DKMS can help vendors there too.

      I used to work for a DR company that had fledgling support for Linux.  It was rock.  As a previous poster mentioned life gets difficult if you have a kernel and need to splice a driver onto that kernel.  For instance, the DR company had HP servers, the idea being that the technicians each had to learn only one hardware platform.  If a customer had Dell or IBM kit then the number one problem was getting their RAID array into the kernel.  As most operations did not have a seperate boot disk, the root would often need to be supplyed through RAID.  Dependant on their implementation you'd have to either:<br>a) Do a re-install of the OS on the new box and use the drivers etc. supplied with that.<br>b) Install on a similar box, pinch or compile driver, remake initrd, bodge /boot and possibly root fs to hold drivers.<br>I can't begin to describe how simple that is with a customer behind you going spare that their Oracle DB isn't coming back :)<br>Now don't get me wrong, it's as nasty for windows, just quicker, because the drivers are already compiled for you and its the time that DR customers care about.<p>All in all initiatives like dkms and a stabilisation of the driver API would be welcome in the corporate world and I'm glad the kernel summit is exposing these issues.

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 22, 2021</br>
           </div>
The beginning of the 5.12 merge window was delayed as the result of severe
weather in the US Pacific Northwest.  Once Linus Torvalds got going, though, he
wasted little time; as of this writing, just over 8,600 non-merge
changesets have been pulled into the mainline repository for the 5.12
release — over a period of about two days.  As one might imagine, that work
contains a long list of significant changes.
<p>
The most interesting changes merged for 5.12 so far include:
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> A number of 32-bit Arm platforms (efm32, picoxcell, prima2, tango,
     u300, zx, and c6x) have been removed after they turned out to have no
     users.  A long list of associated device drivers has been removed as
     well. 
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The BPF instruction set has gained a set of atomic operations;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/de948576f8e7">this
     documentation commit</a> and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7064a7341a0d">this merge
     message</a> for more information.
<li> BPF programs can now be attached to "bare" tracepoints — those which
     have no associated trace event visible from user space.  Bare
     tracepoints exist out of the fear that a visible event could
     eventually become part of the kernel ABI and thus difficult to
     change.  The <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6939f4ef16d4">BPF
     patch</a> includes a warning that bare tracepoints have no ABI
     guarantees, but what will actually happen if a bare-tracepoint change
     breaks user-space code is not entirely clear.
<li> BPF programs can now access data on the stack via pointers with
     variable offsets; this removes an annoying limitation that developers
     have had to work around until now.  Consider an array on the stack,
     for example; previously it was only possible to access that array with
     a constant index, while now a variable index may be used.  The
     verifier has been extended to 
     ensure that such accesses remain within bounds.  This relaxation only
     applies to privileged programs, though, due to fears of
     speculative-execution exploits.
<li> Support for the "oprofile" profiling subsystem has been removed.
     Oprofile has not been actively used for some time, having long been
     supplanted by perf events.
<li> The io_uring subsystem is now integrated with memory control groups so
     that its memory use is properly accounted for and regulated.
<li> It is now possible to choose between the various scheduler preemption
     modes (none, voluntary, or full) at boot time if the
     <tt>PREEMPT_DYNAMIC</tt> configuration option is selected.  There is a
     knob under debugfs that can be used to switch at run time as well.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/843163/"><tt>LOOKUP_CACHED</tt> patches</a>
     have been merged.  These allow user space (along with io_uring) to
     request that a pathname lookup be done without blocking or not at
     all. 
<li> The Btrfs filesystem has gained support for zoned block devices — sort
     of.  Zoned-device support is clearly a work in progress and is not
     ready for real use yet.
<li> F2FS now allows the specification of the compression algorithm and
     level to use; the LZ4 "high compression" mode is now supported.
<li> The new <tt>FS_IOC_READ_VERITY_METADATA</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command
     can be used to read the metadata from files protected by <a
     href="/Articles/790185/">fs-verity</a>.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e17fe6579de0">this commit</a> for
     details. 

</ul>

<p>

<li> <b>USB</b>:
     Cadence dual-role USB controllers and
     USB MaxLinear/Exar USB to serial converters.
<li> The kernel now supports dynamic thermal power management via a
     subsystem that allows the power usage of groups of devices to be
     capped to meet thermal constraints.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f5ad1c747956">this documentation
     commit</a> for more information.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The rapidly developing <a href="/Articles/544399/">multipath TCP</a>
     implementation has gained the 
     ability to attach a priority to specific subflows; some can, for
     example, be marked as only being for backup use should the primary
     flow(s) fail.
<Li> The IGMPv3 subsystem has gained "explicit host tracking" support; see
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5225d5f57b35">this merge
     message</a> for a few details.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/833840/">threaded NAPI polling patches</a> have
     been merged; this work can improve performance for some workloads.
     There is a new sysfs knob that can be used to control threaded
     polling; see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5fdd2f0e5c64">this
     commit</a> for details.
<li> The netfilter packet-filtering mechanism now supports the idea of
     "ownership" of specific tables.  This allows, for example, a firewall
     daemon to maintain exclusive control of the tables it manages.
</Ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The integrity measurement architecture (IMA) subsystem can now
     "measure" various bits of data within the kernel itself to ensure that
     they have not been tampered with.  It can, for example, check the
     current SELinux policy for changes.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Virtualization and containers</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The KVM subsystem has gained the ability to intercept Xen hypercalls
     and pass them to user space for emulation.

</ul>

<p>
If the normal schedule stays in place, the 5.12 merge window can be
expected to close on February&nbsp;28.  It is not clear, at this point,
whether the loss of nearly one week of testing time will lead to an
extension of the merge window or not.  Regardless, stay tuned for our
summary of the remainder of the merge window, to be posted after the window
closes, whenever that may be.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Cool to see fs-verity developing in this direction, it&#x27;s what I was hoping for. The concept of &quot;an untrusted file store which allows efficiently verifiable random access to file contents&quot; seems super useful for e.g. container workloads. You can optimize things a lot if you can lazily fetch and cache data, and having a merkle tree lets you do that while still being able to locally ensure the data is consistent and traceable to an approved workload.<br>
<p>
I haven&#x27;t quite gotten there yet, but I have some Rust code for generating the merkle tree hash, which is useful for creating signatures on workloads on a server which does not have native fs-verity, or produces incompatible fs-verity hashes (e.g. because of different page size): <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fs-verity">https://crates.io/crates/fs-verity</a> (apologies for the advertising).<br>

Watching Linux gradually gain support for N64 hardware in 2021 is a little bit surreal, but cool. Having something that&#x27;s not a total black box running on it should help uplift emulators a fair amount too - you&#x27;d think popular 25 year old hardware would be well understood and preserved by now, but the ecosystem for it is in worse shape than a lot of its contemporaries.<br>

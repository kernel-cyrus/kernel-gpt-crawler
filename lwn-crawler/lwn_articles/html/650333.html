           </div>
Concurrent code running in user space is subject to almost all of the same
constraints as code running in the kernel.  One of those is that cross-CPU
operations tend to ruin performance, meaning that data access should be
done on a per-CPU basis whenever possible.  Unlike kernel code, though,
user-space per-CPU code cannot enter atomic context; it, thus, cannot
protect itself from being preempted or moved to another CPU.  The <a
href="/Articles/649288/">restartable sequences patch set</a> recently
posted by Paul Turner demonstrates one possible solution to that
problem by providing a limited sort of atomic context for user-space code.
<p>
Imagine maintaining a per-CPU linked list, and needing to insert a new
element at the head of that list.  Code to do so might look something like
this:
<p>
<pre>
    new_item-&gt;next = list_head[cpu];
    list_head[cpu] = new_item;
</pre>
<p>
Such code faces a couple of hazards in a multiprocessing environment.  If
it is preempted between the two statements above, another process might
slip in and insert its own new element; when the original process resumes,
it will overwrite <tt>list_head[cpu]</tt>, causing the loss of the item
added while 
it was preempted.  If, instead, the process is moved to a different CPU, it
could get confused between each CPU's list or run concurrently with a new
process on the original CPU; the result in either case would be a corrupted
list and late-night phone calls to the developer.
<p>
These situations are easily avoidable by using locks, but locks are
expensive even in the absence of contention.  The same holds for atomic
operations like compare-and-swap; they work, but the result can be
unacceptably slow.  So developers have long looked for faster alternatives.
<p>
The key observation behind restartable sequences is that the above code
shares a specific feature with many other high-performance critical
sections, in that it can be divided into two parts:
(1)&nbsp;an arbitrary amount of setup work that can be thrown away and
redone if need be, and (2)&nbsp;a single instruction that "commits" the
operation.  The first line in that sequence:
<p>
<pre>
    new_item-&gt;next = list_head[cpu];
</pre>
<p>
has no visible effect outside the process it is executing in; if that
process were preempted after that line, it could just execute it again and
all would be well.  The second line, though:
<p>
<pre>
    list_head[cpu] = new_item;
</pre>
<p>
has effects that are visible to any other process that uses the list head.  If the
executing process has been preempted or moved in the middle of the
sequence, that last line must not be executed lest it corrupt the list.
If, instead, the sequence 
has run uninterrupted, this assignment can be executed with no need for locks or
atomic instructions.  That, in turn, would make it fast.
<p>
A restartable sequence as implemented by Paul's patch is really just a
small bit of code stored in a 
special region of memory; that code implements both the setup and commit
stages as described above.  If the kernel preempts a process (or moves it
to another CPU) while the process is running in that special section,
control will jump to a special restart handler.
That handler does whatever is needed to restart the sequence; often (as it
would be in the linked-list case) it's just a matter of going back to the
beginning and starting over.
<p>
The sequence must adhere to some
restrictions; in particular, the commit operation must be a single
instruction and code within the special section cannot invoke any code outside of
it.  But, if it holds to the rules, a repeatable sequence can function as a small
critical section without the need for locks or atomic operations.
In a sense, restartable sequences can be thought as a sort of poor
developer's transactional memory.  If the operation is interrupted before
it commits, the work done so far is simply tossed out and it all restarts
from the beginning.
<p>
Paul's patch adds a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int restartable_sequences(int op, int flags, long val1, long val2, long val3);
</pre>
<p>
There are two operations that can be passed as the <tt>op</tt> parameter:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>SYS_RSEQ_SET_CRITICAL</tt> sets the critical region; <tt>val1</tt>
     and <tt>val2</tt> are the bounds of that region, and <tt>val3</tt> is
     a pointer to the restart handler (which must be outside of the
     region).
<p>
<li> <tt>SYS_RSEQ_SET_CPU_POINTER</tt> specifies a location (in
     <tt>val1</tt>) of an integer variable to hold the current CPU number.
     This location should be in thread-local storage; it allows each thread
     to quickly determine which CPU it is running on at any time.
</ul>
<p>
The CPU-number pointer is needed so that each section can quickly get to
the correct per-CPU data; to emphasize that, the restart handler will not
actually be called until this pointer has been set.
Only one region for restartable sequences can be established (but
it can contain multiple sequences if the restart handler is smart enough),
and the region is shared across all threads in a process.
<p>
Paul notes that Google is using this code internally now; it was also <a
href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2013/ocw/system/presentations/1695/original/LPC%20-%20PerCpu%20Atomics.pdf">discussed
at the Linux Plumbers Conference [PDF]</a> in 2013.  He does not believe it is
suitable for mainline inclusion in its current form, though.  The
single-region limitation does not play well with library code, the critical
section must currently be written in assembly, and the interactions with
thread-local storage are painful.  But, he thinks, it is a reasonable
starting place for a discussion on how a proper interface might be
designed.
<p>
Paul's patch is not the only one in this area; Mathieu Desnoyers posted <a
href="/Articles/645717/">a patch set with similar goals</a> back in May.
Given <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1959603/focus=1961389">Linus's
reaction</a>, it's safe to say that Mathieu's patch will not be merged
anytime soon, but Mathieu did achieve <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1959603/focus=1962052">his
secondary goal</a> of getting Paul to post his patches.  In any case, there is
clearly interest in mechanisms that can improve 
the performance of highly concurrent user-space code, so we will almost
certainly see more patches along these lines in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Perhaps a similar mechanism could be used for concurrency in general, assuming a single-CPU machine.  The special section runs and if the process is pre-empted for any reason at all then the restart handler is called.  Then the final commit is a single instruction.  If the scheduler timeslice is big enough this might let multithreaded code be written without locking.  Of course the process will starve if interrupts happen so often the special section can never complete.<br>

I've always considered that (concurrency-wise) thread-local storage is to userspace threads what per-cpu data is to kernel threads.<br>
<p>
Under the assumption that the scheduler always tries hard to keep threads on the same CPU as long as possible, the effect is almost the same. In the best case (N threads &lt;= N CPUs) per-thread ~ per-cpu, in the worst case there can be some bouncing.<br>
But on the other hand side, in this last case you still need locks, atomics or barriers for the per-cpu data case as well, since multiple threads will share the per-cpu data.<br>
<p>
On many occasions I believed that per-cpu data in userspace would be great, but every time I concluded that I could reach the same goal with TLS. But, then they're writing an allocator and storing data per-thread is a waste of memory...<br>
<p>
Would a vDSO approach with seqlock + CPUID work?<br>
The kernel could increase a sequence number and update current CPUID for every migration (and/or context switch!). Userspace could use the sequence number like a seqlock.<br>

Maybe we could design backwards from an exposure of this in the stdlib...<br>
<p>
What if it was set up like this?<br>
<p>
&lt;pre&gt;<br>
// normal code<br>
restartable_set_restore(&amp;list_head);<br>
// restartable section<br>
new_item-&gt;next = list_head;<br>
// critical instruction<br>
restartable_critical_move_ptr(&amp;list_head, new_item);<br>
// normal code<br>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br>
<p>
We could say that "the code between set_restore and a critical_foo() will be run in its entirety one or more times". If any other tasks performed a critical set on the watched memory address during that time, then the move is not performed and we jump to the restart.<br>
<p>
The critical move would be ran in a syscall that takes two pointers, and would jump to the restart point if the "fuse" was "broken", or perform the operation and "break" all other "fuses" on that address.<br>
<p>
That would be like Redis's MULTI/WATCH/EXEC operations... You would need to get the compiler to cooperate, though.<br>

I think the whole idea of the approach (using a memory region) is to avoid making syscalls, basically for performance. This way the scheduler can just compare the Instruction Pointer to detect if a restart is needed. Note that the critical section should run much more often than the scheduler for this to be a net win.<br>
<p>
Maybe another (naive?) approach would be to share a memory pointer with the kernel where the thread can publish a restart address. Say something like<br>
<p>
   set_atomic_restart(&amp;ptr);<br>
<p>
with ptr some memory owned by the thread big enough for a pointer. With that, an application can do <br>
<p>
   ptr=&amp;&amp;some_label; <br>
<p>
when entering a critical section, and ptr=NULL; when leaving. If the scheduler needs to pre-empt the thread and finds that ptr has a non-null value, execution would restart at ptr instead of the saved IP. <br>

I thought the whole point of using futexes for locks in NPTL was so that no syscalls were necessary for them in the uncontended case, either, in which case this whole thing is no faster than the locky approach (but is a lot more complex).<br>

Futexes have to use atomic operations for their fastpaths and they are quite slow. You can't avoid them because your thread might be migrated to another CPU, so non-atomic memory access will likely ruin everything.<br>

What people think about generalizing this like a bit ?<br>
<p>
Process can register a signal (and glibc could automatically register one and "steal" it from userspace similarly to what they're already doing for some pthread stuff).<br>
<p>
So kernel would raise this signal to a thread before returning to user-space every time either:<br>
<p>
a) this thread was previously running on different CPU<br>
<p>
b) this thread gets CPU _back_ after some other thread run on this CPU<br>
<p>
Then libc could implement restartable_seq by simply looking at PC in siginfo's ucontext. Quick "current cpu number" cache and perhaps a range of other things could be implemented just as easily with this signal.<br>
<p>
This signal does not need to be queue-able. And could be block-able as normal. Seems much cleaner and more generic thing to me.<br>
<p>
I know, people in general have bad attitude towards signals, but in this case it looks like better option that glibc can abstract further. Of course unless I'm missing something crucial.<br>

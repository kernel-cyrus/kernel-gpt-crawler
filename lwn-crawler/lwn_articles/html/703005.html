           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 12, 2016</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2016-LinuxCon_Europe">LinuxCon
Europe</a>
</div>
LWN's <a href="/Articles/686697/">traditional development statistics
article for the 4.6 development 
cycle</a> ended with a statement that the process was running smoothly and that
there were no process scalability issues in sight.  Wolfram Sang started
his 2016 <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe">LinuxCon
Europe</a> talk by taking issue with that claim.  He thinks 
that there are indeed scalability problems in the kernel's development
process.  A look at his argument is of interest, especially when contrasted
with another recent talk on maintainer scalability.
<p>
<h4>Beyond changesets merged</h4>
<p>
Sang's core point is that looking at the number of patches merged only
tells part of the story; it says nothing about what had to happen to get
those patches into the mainline.  Looking at the last few years' worth of
development cycles, he noted that relatively few patches carry tags beyond
the Signed-off-by applied by the developer and the committer.  In
particular, around the 3.0 days, only about 20% of the patches in the
mainline had an Acked-by, Reviewed-by, or Tested-by tag indicating that
anybody other than the maintainer had seriously looked at them.  That
number is closer to 40% in current kernels, he said; it is a clear
improvement, but still does not make him happy.  For a properly scalable
kernel process, he said, we should have much higher levels of review by
developers who are not the subsystem maintainer.
<p>
Another metric one can look at is the time difference  between the date on
the patch and the date on which it was first committed to a git tree.  The
Ethernet driver maintainers, he said, are heroes: 80% of all the patches
were accepted within two weeks.  A number of other subsystems do not do

<a href="/Articles/703006/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/lceu/WolframSang-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250

align="left"></a> 

anywhere near as well, and some have gotten significantly worse.  I2C,
Sang's own subsystem, has stayed about the same over the last three years,
which surprised him.  As the workload has increased, it has come to feel
like things are getting much worse.
<p>
The time-to-commit metric may be useful, but it is not without its flaws.
The final version of a patch may have been committed fairly quickly, but
previous versions could have languished without review for a long time.
Patches that are rejected or that get lost are not considered at all.
<p>
One way to try to get a better handle on things is to look at the <a
href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/">Patchwork</a>
systems for the subystems that use it, and, in particular, to look at the
backlog of patches found there.  For <a
href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-i2c/list/">I2C</a>, it
shows a relatively low 
backlog until about 3.16, when he gave up on trying to keep up with the
flow and fell behind.  The <a
href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-acpi/list/">ACPI
subsystem</a> has an amazing backlog of zero.
The relevant maintainer (Rafael Wysocki) was in the room; he noted that it
depends on how a subsystem uses Patchwork.  He said that he quickly marks a
lot of patches as inapplicable; Sang replied that he doesn't even have
the time to do that.

The <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-ext4/list/">ext4
filesystem</a> shows a linear growth in its backlog, up to about 800
patches currently.  The numbers for several other subsystems were shown;
almost all of them are going up.
<p>
The problem, Sang said, is that the number of committers is not scaling to
match the growing number of contributors to the kernel.  We are getting
more reviewers, but they are coming in slowly and are not anywhere near
enough.  As a result, the number of unprocessed patches is on the increase.
<p>
How can this problem be addressed?  Users can help by commenting on and,
especially, testing patches.  Developers need to be aware that sloppiness
is often a problem; they should acknowledge when they have done suboptimal
work.  Developers need to take part in reviewing; if nothing else, they
should review their own patches.  For maintainers, working harder is not
generally the solution; that just leads to burnout.  They should get their
tools in order and automate tasks whenever possible; looking at what other
maintainers are using can be helpful.  Companies should allow and encourage
their developers to spend time reviewing patches.
<p>
What he does not want to see is a "kernel infrastructure initiative".  The
<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure
Initiative</a>, run by the Linux Foundation as a way to 
channel resources to important but underfunded projects, is a good thing,
but it is a reaction to a problem that got out of control.  Things had to
go wrong first.  Sang would rather see action now to keep things from
getting to that state.
<p>
For I2C, Sang intends to step back a bit.  He will become one of the I2C
developers, one of its architects, and one of its reviewers, but he will
not be the only one.  That may slow things down in the short term, since he
will be doing less patch review.  The advantage is that he will stay sane,
and will have the time and energy to try to address the problem on higher
levels.
<p>
<h4>The maintainer as bottleneck</h4>
<p>
While Sang intends to step back on patch review, his plan still calls for
him to be the sole committer of patches for the I2C subsystem.  In this
context, it is interesting to look at another talk, given at <a
href="https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2016/">Kernel 
Recipes</a> one week earlier by i915 graphics driver maintainer Daniel
Vetter.  He, too, made the point that maintainers don't scale, but he would
rather see maintainers get help at all levels.
<p>
One year ago, he would have said that there was no problem in the i915
subsystem.  Applying patches was relatively easy, after all.  He had never
reviewed the majority of the patches there; i915 has a number of developers
who can do that.  But, as the single maintainer, he gave the subsystem "a
bus factor of one"; when he wasn't available for any reason, things simply
came to a stop.
<p>
At <a href="/Articles/662979/">the 2015 Kernel Summit</a>, Linus Torvalds said
that he has come to 
like the group maintainer model, where more than one person takes
responsibility for a given subsystem.  Vetter wanted to give that a try,
but he quickly ran into a problem: nobody was willing to sign up as the
co-maintainer for the i915 subsystem.  He was, however, able to find
developers who were willing to commit patches for i915; indeed, he signed
up 15 of them.  He figured he would experiment with the multiple-committer

<a href="/Articles/703007/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/recipes/DanielVetter-sm.jpg" width=200 height=251

align="right"></a> 


model for one release cycle.  After all, nobody had ever really tried this
before in the kernel, so it must be a stupid idea.
<p>
That was one year ago, he said, and disaster has failed to materialize.
Instead, he has "seriously happy contributors," and a whole set of
reviewers who can apply the patches they look at.  He is now "a bored
maintainer," and all of the nagging and begging to get code merged has gone
away.  He has found that commit rights are a strong carrot that can be used
to get developers and companies to contribute — and to be careful about the
work they do.  It also leads to
"distributed conflict management" that makes life easier.
<p>
So what does he do anymore?  His main job at this point, as "the"
maintainer for i915, is communications with the outside, including any work
that requires coordination with other subsystem trees.  He connects
developers with the appropriate reviewers, and puts together the pull
requests to send work upstream.  And, of course, he "takes the blame for
everything".
<p>
To make this model work, he said, a subsystem clearly needs a team of developers,
and non-maintainer reviews must be the norm.  The group should be
consistent, with developers who stay around; otherwise, enforcement via
social feedback will not work well.  Good documentation and tools are
necessary; i915 has a set of process documents on <a
href="http://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/maintainer-tools/drm-intel.html">this
page</a>.  When somebody makes a mistake, if possible, a check should be
put into the tools to keep it from happening again.
<p>
Good testing is crucial to this model.  A multi-committer tree can never be
rebased, so there is no way to remove embarrassing mistakes.  They really
need to 
be avoided in the first place; that requires good pre-commit testing to
ensure that the obscure corner cases do not break.
<p>
The rough consensus model works best for a group like this.  The default on
any patch is "no action", so a developer's full disagreement will stop
things.  What's 
important, he said, is to have agreement on the goals for the subsystem;
disagreement on the path taken toward those goals is acceptable.  A good
rule of thumb 
is "if you push a patch and there's screaming on IRC, you shouldn't have
done it."
<p>
In general, he said, the kernel could probably benefit from more maintainer
groups like this.  It is a more efficient way to maintain busy subsystems,
especially those that currently have a lot of submaintainer trees.
<p>
<h4>Meanwhile in Berlin</h4>
<p>
Fast-forward one week; your editor raised this idea in Sang's talk and
asked whether the single-committer model might be part of the scalability
problems raised there.  The developers in that room tended toward
skepticism over whether the idea could work outside of the i915 tree.
Wysocki, in particular, seemed to feel that there were relatively few
submaintainers who could be trusted with full commit access.  These
maintainers push patches that must be rejected fairly often, so they should
not be able to commit directly to the subsystem tree.
<p>
Perhaps these developers, too, would be pleasantly surprised if they were
to run an experiment with more widely distributed commit rights.  In any case,
it seems likely that growing numbers of developers and patches will put
more stress on subsystem maintainers.  If those maintainers are not to
become a choke point for kernel development, ways to spread the work they
do will be required.

<p>
Yeah, this is sorely tempting.<br>
<p>
At kernel-summit-07 I discussed and basically proposed the Reviewed-by:<br>
thing and everyone was surprisingly agreeable.  I think I floated the<br>
idea of making it obligatory but in no way have I pushed it at all.  I<br>
just don't have the energy and the grief-absorption-capability.<br>
<p>
It would be a huuuuuge change.  A dramatic one.  It would quickly cause<br>
the organisation of an economy in which people find they need to<br>
"trade" reviewing activity.  People would understand that if they don't<br>
review other people's stuff then others won't review their stuff and<br>
they don't get their patches merged.<br>
<p>
Would it increase kernel quality?  Yes, quite a bit I expect.<br>
<p>
Would it slow things down?  Yes, it would.<br>
<p>
But both of those are the same thing.<br>
<p>
<p>
Should we do it?  Well, yes, I think we should.  There would be some<br>
bumps and glitches but once we got into the swing of it, the impact<br>
would be not too bad.  After all, it is just a formalisation of<br>
something which we're supposed to be doing already!  If we were doing<br>
that which we _know_ we should be doing, the impact would be zero.<br>
<p>
_can_ we do it?  Well, the steps are:<br>
<p>
1: gather general consensus that we have some problem<br>
<p>
2: get agreement and that the problem needs fixing<br>
<p>
3: get agreement that this process step is one way of fixing said problem<br>
<p>
4: implement it.<br>
<p>
I think that we'd have a good chance of succeeding in all these steps. <br>
After all, the winning debating point here is that *we're already<br>
supposed to be reviewing all patches*.<br>
<p>
<p>
Problem is, do I have the requisite energy to try to inflict this on<br>
everyone at KS08?  It's looking doubtful at present.  It's much easier<br>
if Linus just stands up and says "you all suck and we're doing this".<br>
"""<br>
<p>
I really do think reviews are undervalued in the sense that the reviewer often don't get very much out of it for themselves. You can put hours into a review but that is not recognised beyond a single "Reviewed-by" line in the final commit; in terms of personal exposure (which I do believe is a big factor for non-maintainer contributors, for better or worse), it is much more attractive to write code and patches.<br>
<p>
Maybe maintainers should include review and reviewer stats in their pull requests, crediting not just the patch authors, but also the reviewers. This would also make it more obvious when large batches of patches have not been reviewed.<br>

Maybe code reviews should be marked using tags instead of commit message strings - that way they can be added after-the-fact.<br>
I suspect Git's refspec will need to learn to "exclude" things rather than being inclusive only, otherwise people who pull tags will get overloaded with them.<br>

I wasn't aware of this mail from Andrew, but this is what I've done in i915, and essentially what's going on in the drm subsystem at large. Reviews are required, period. And yes we have a flourishing tit-for-tat review market going on, coordinated mostly over irc ;-)<br>
<p>
One key bit to make that happen imo is that the maintainer (even with committer model) is a great example, and goes to great pains to get a review even for trivial patches, if those patches are their own. Otherwise everyone stops bothering with haggling for some reviewer's bandwidth real fast.<br>

Thank you for pointing out Andrew's mail. I couldn't agree more. What I forgot to mention in my talks: I2C will require "Reviewed-by" tags in the near future as well.  Let's see how that works. The idea of mentioning reviewers in pull-requests is great, I'll definately do that!<br>

When discussing scalability with other maintainers I hear the complaint that there's lack of trustworthy submaintainers, or reviewers or whatever fairly often. Like I said in my talk, I never really had the problem, neither with reviewers (that worked well from the start and constantly grew to more people) and submaintainers (candidates refused to sign up, not a problem with lack of them). I think a primary role as maintainer is to grow people into these roles and make sure there's enough, at least in a busy subsystem with plenty of contributors. If you fail to do that, then you're not a great maintainer in my opinion.<br>

Subsystems differ. As tglx nicely put it at LinuxCon, I2C is more of a "drive-by" subsystem. You do the driver, get it accepted, then move on to, say, SPI. This is different from GFX and network drivers which need more constant attention. So IMO, there it is easier to keep developers also attached to the whole subsystem, too.<br>
<p>
That being said, I got co-maintainers for ACPI and muxes. I definately am willing to share responsibility and do that when I see talent. Currently, though, there are exactly 0 regular reviewers on the list which I could award with extra responsibility.<br>

It also depends on the subsystem. Networking and filesystems are easy, you can test whatever you have on almost any machine, not dependent on particular hardware.<br>

Well, thanks.  I felt I was doing something wrong. :-)<br>
<p>
Maybe not everyone is like you and not every piece of the kernel code they maintain is like yours.<br>
<p>
There are some good (and responsive) reviewers for some pieces of code I maintain and for some of them I only pick up patches reviewed by certain people (and some of them are listed as maintainers of those pieces of code even), but I do commit the majority of patches and it looks like this works for everybody involved.  I have no problems with that either.<br>
<p>
I have to admit that I wouldn't have been able to handle the volume without those reviewers, but then my experience with people sending me pull requests and so on is seriously less than fantastic.<br>

It's interesting to see that the "Linus doesn't scale" problem has moved further down the maintainer tree as kernel development accelerates.<br>

To be fair, i915 hasn't relied on a single maintainer for nearly three years now. Going from 1 to 2 maintainers was the hard part, and once we'd gotten all the tooling and documentation together for that, going from 2 to 15 wasn't much of a bump in the road.<br>

Yeah I pretty badly screwed up the opening for my talk here. Jani's been an awesome co-maintainer, and he's doing a stellar job wrestling -fixes, bug reports and a lot of related seemingly boring but rather important things. And of course polishing all the overall process issues. But since we specialize quite a lot we'd still have a rather big problem if either of us disappears, and that's what I meant to express with a essentially a bus factor of one. But with stage panic and all that I made a mess of it all and dropped all the important bits :(<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 14, 2023</br>
           </div>
The Linux fast user-space mutex ("futex") subsystem debuted with the 2.6.0
kernel; it provides a mechanism that can be used to implement user-space
locking.  Since futexes avoid calling into the kernel whenever possible,
they can indeed be fast, especially in the uncontended case.  The API used
to access futexes has never been seen as one of Linux's strongest points,
though, so there has long been a desire to improve it.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230807121843.710612856@infradead.org/">This patch
series</a> from Peter Zijlstra shows what the future of futexes may look
like.
<p>
A futex is a 32-bit value stored in user-space memory that is,
presumably, shared between at least two threads or processes.  When used as
a lock, a futex can be acquired with a single compare-and-swap instruction,
without kernel involvement.  The kernel comes into the picture, though, in
the contended case, where a thread must block until a futex becomes
available.  Waiting for a futex and waking threads that are waiting are
some of the features provided by the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html"><tt>futex()</tt></a>
system call.
<p>
<tt>futex()</tt> is a multiplexed system call, meaning that it performs a
number of unrelated operations depending on its arguments.  Over the years,
as futex functionality has grown, this system call has become complex and
unwieldy, to put it mildly.  It is difficult to use, and difficult to
extend further.  This API has, among other things, slowed the addition of
features that developers would like to see.
<p>
For some years, there has been talk of splitting the futex API into a set
of more focused system calls; LWN <a href="/Articles/823513/">covered one
such discussion</a> in 2020.  Thus far, though, actual progress in this
direction has been limited to <a href="/Articles/866112/">the addition of
<tt>futex_waitv()</tt></a> to the 5.16 release in early 2022; work on
futexes seemingly stalled after that.  With the current patch set, Zijlstra
appears to be trying to restart this project and bring a better futex API
to the mainline.
<p>
This patch series includes three new system calls:
<p>
<pre>
    int futex_wait(void *addr, unsigned long val, unsigned long mask, unsigned int flags,
    		   struct __kernel_timespec *timeout, clockid_t clockid);

    int futex_wake(void *addr, unsigned long mask, int nr, unsigned int flags);

    int futex_requeue(struct futex_waitv *waiters, unsigned int flags, int nr_wake,
		      int nr_requeue);
</pre>
<p>
For the most part, so far, these system calls are just new interfaces to
existing functionality.  <tt>futex_wait()</tt> is the same as
<tt>futex(FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET)</tt>; it will cause the calling thread to wait
on the futex stored at <tt>addr</tt>, assuming that futex contains
<tt>val</tt> at the time of the call.  The <tt>mask</tt> will be stored in
the kernel's context for this thread.  <tt>futex_wake()</tt> mirrors the
<tt>FUTEX_WAKE_BITSET</tt> operation, using <tt>mask</tt> to identify which
waiter(s) to wake.  <tt>futex_requeue()</tt> is another interface to
<tt>FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE</tt>, which can wake some waiters and requeue others
onto a different futex.
<p>
There is also some new functionality that is made available via the new
API, generally using the <tt>flags</tt> argument.  One of the new flags is
<tt>FUTEX2_NUMA</tt>, which is intended to improve performance on NUMA
systems.  User space is in control of the placement of its futexes and can,
thus, ensure that they live on a NUMA node that is close to the threads
that are using it.  But the kernel maintains its own data structures for
futexes that are being waited on; poor placement of those structures can
slow everything down.  This problem was <a
href="/Articles/685769/">mentioned here</a> in 2016, but still lacks a
solution in mainline kernels.
<p>
As noted above, a futex is a 32-bit value.  When the <tt>FUTEX2_NUMA</tt>
flag is provided, though, the futex(es) referred to are, instead, interpreted
as:
<p>
<pre>
    struct futex_numa_32 {
	u32 val;
	u32 node;
    };
</pre>
<p>
(Though this structure does not actually appear in this form in the kernel
source).
<p>
The <tt>val</tt> field is the same old 32-bit quantity, while <tt>node</tt>
is the number of the NUMA node on which the kernel should allocate its own
data structures.  The <tt>node</tt> value can also be set to all-ones
(<tt>~0</tt>), in which case the current NUMA node will be used, and the
<tt>node</tt> value will be updated accordingly by the kernel.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230807123323.504975124@infradead.org/">patch</a>
adding this structure admonishes: "<q>If userspace corrupts the node value
between WAIT and WAKE, the futex will not be found and no wakeup will
happen</q>".
<p>
The <tt>FUTEX2_NUMA</tt> flag thus gives user space some control over the
placement of associated memory within the kernel.  If this flag does not
appear, these allocations will be spread across all of the nodes of the
system (as is done with futexes in current kernels).
<p>
One other change in this series is reflected by another set of new flags.
There has long been a desire to get away from the 32-bit requirement for
futexes.  Often, only a single bit is used; a smaller size would reduce
waste and (more importantly) allow more futexes to be crammed into a single
cache line.  To accommodate this need, the new system calls require a
<tt>flags</tt> value indicating the size of the futex(es) to be operated
on; it can be one of <tt>FUTEX2_SIZE_U8</tt>, <tt>FUTEX2_SIZE_U16</tt>, or
<tt>FUTEX2_SIZE_U32</tt>.  There is also a <tt>FUTEX2_SIZE_U64</tt> flag
defined, but 64-bit futexes are not implemented in the current patch set.
<p>
When <tt>FUTEX2_NUMA</tt> is used, the node number has the same size as the
futex value itself.  Thus, a futex operation specifying
<tt>FUTEX2_NUMA|FUTEX2_SIZE_U8</tt> will provide an eight-bit node number,
which could be modeled as:
<p>
<pre>
    struct futex_numa_8 {
    	u8 val;
	u8 node;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The end result of this work is a set of incremental improvements that
cleans up the futex API and provides some functionality that developers
have been asking for.  Review comments have mostly been focused on
relatively minor
details, suggesting that there may not be much in the way of getting these
changes merged into the mainline.  Of course, the job does not end with
these patches;
there is still a lot of functionality provided by <tt>futex()</tt>,
including priority inheritance, that is not available with the new API.
But this work should make the common cases easier for developers to work
with and might even, someday, lead to support for futexes in the GNU C
library.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hopefully the ability to specify 8- and 16-bit futexes is a step to addressing the problems described in the 2016 talk Real-Time Summit 2016 meeting called "Futexes are cursed" (<a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/_media/realtime/events/rt-summit2016/futexes_sebastian-siewior.pdf">https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/_media/realtime/events/r...</a>) and the similarly themed next presentation called "Pthread Condvars: Posix Compliance and the PI Gap" (<a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/_media/realtime/events/rt-summit2016/pthread-condvars-posix-compliance-and-the-pi-gap_darren-hart_torvald-riegel.pdf">https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/_media/realtime/events/r...</a>).   The conclusion then was there was not enough space in the existing futex either to entirely eliminate out-of-order wakeups or to implement priority inheritance.  Letting userspace choose the size of futexes is great, as that means that embedded control systems should (eventually) be able to have PI and giant systems can still have many, many simultaneous futexes.<br>
<p>
There's still the question of what libpthread will choose, but there are alternatives there as well (<a href="https://ossna2020.sched.com/event/cZIe/librtpi-conditional-variables-for-real-time-applications-gratian-crisan-national-instruments">https://ossna2020.sched.com/event/cZIe/librtpi-conditiona...</a>).<br>

"Futexes are cursed" as I recall was basically about the difficulty of fixing them in the kernel, and "Pthread Condvars" was about the difficulty of fixing them in glibc.     Problems, as described by the reliably excellent LWN article, were false (misordered) wakeups and no ability to implement priority inheritance.   The root cause is too fee bits to indicate state, as is so often the case for older APIs.    Recently I have thought that it's too bad that the kernel chose not to break the futex() ABI at the same time it essentially forced distros to switch to 64-bit time.<br>

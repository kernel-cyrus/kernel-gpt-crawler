           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 21, 2008</br>
           </div>
Kernel memory is normally allocated in relatively small chunks - usually
just a single page at a time.  As the size of an allocation grows,
satisfying that allocation with physically-contiguous pages gets
progressively harder.  So most of the kernel has been written with an eye
toward avoiding the use of large, contiguous allocations.  There are times,
though, when a large memory array needs to be virtually contiguous, but not
necessarily physically contiguous.  One example is the allocation of space
for loadable modules; any given module should live in a single, contiguous
address range, but nobody cares how it's laid out in physical RAM.  For
cases like this, the kernel provides a set of functions like
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> and <tt>vmap()</tt>.
<p>
Functions like <tt>vmalloc()</tt> have long been known to be somewhat
expensive to use.  They have to work with a single shared (and limited)
address range, and they require making changes to the kernel's page
tables.  Page table changes, in turn, require translation lookaside buffer
(TLB) flushes, which are a costly, all-CPUs operation.  So kernel
developers have generally tried to avoid using these functions in
performance-critical parts of the kernel.
<p>
Nick Piggin has noticed, though, that the performance characteristics of
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> and friends are catching up with us.  The
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> address space is kept on a linked list and protected by
a global lock, which does not scale very well.  But the real cost is in
freeing memory regions in this space; the ensuing TLB flush must be done
using an inter-processor interrupt to every CPU, each of which must then
flush its own TLB.  People normally do not buy more CPUs unless they have
more work to run on them, so systems with more processors will, as a
general rule, be performing more mapping and freeing in the
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> range.  As systems grow, there will be more global TLB
flushes, each of which disrupts more processors.  In other words, the
amount of work grows proportional to the square of the number of processors
- meaning that everything falls down, eventually.
<p>
To make things worse, Nick has a longstanding series of patches which,
among other things, do a lot of <tt>vmap()</tt> calls to support larger
block sizes in the filesystem layer and page cache.  Merging those patches would add
significantly to the amount of time the system spends managing the
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> space, which would not be a good thing.  So fixing
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> seems like a good thing to do first.  As of 2.6.28, Nick
has, in fact, fixed the management of kernel virtual allocations.
<p>

The first step is to get rid of the linked list and its corresponding
global lock.  Instead, a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/184495/">red-black tree</a> is used to track
ranges of available address space; finding a suitable region can now be
done without having to traverse a long list.  The tree is still protected
by a global lock, which poses potential scalability problems.  To avoid
this issue, Nick's patch creates a separate, per-CPU list of small
address ranges which can be allocated and freed in a lockless manner.  New
functions must be called to make use of this facility:
<p>
<pre>
    void *vm_map_ram(struct page **pages, unsigned int count, 
                     int node, pgprot_t prot);
    void vm_unmap_ram(const void *mem, unsigned int count);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>vm_map_ram()</tt> will create a virtually-contiguous mapping
for the given <tt>pages</tt>.  The associated data structures will be
allocated on the given NUMA <tt>node</tt>; the memory will have the
protection specified in <tt>prot</tt>.  With the version of the patch
merged for 2.6.28, mappings of up to 64 pages can be made from the
per-cpu lists.
<p>
Note that these functions do not allocate memory, they just create a
virtual mapping for a given set of pages.  They are a replacement for
<tt>vmap()</tt> and <tt>vunmap()</tt>, not <tt>vmalloc()</tt> and
<tt>vfree()</tt>.  It is probably possible to rewrite <tt>vmalloc()</tt> to
use this mechanism, but that has not happened.  So <tt>vmalloc()</tt> calls
still require the acquisition of a global lock.
<p>
There's another trick in this patch set which is used by all of the kernel
virtual address management functions.  Nick realized that it is not
actually necessary to flush TLBs across the system immediately after an
address range is freed.  Since those addresses are being given back to the
system, no code will be making use of them afterward, so it does not matter
if a processor's TLB contains a stale mapping for them.  All that really
matters is that the TLB gets cleaned out before those addresses are used
again elsewhere.   So unmapped regions can be allowed to accumulate, then
all flushed with a single operation.  That cuts the number of TLB flushes
significantly.
<p>
How much faster do things run?  Nicks patch (the merged version can be
found <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=db64fe02258f1507e13fe5212a989922323685ce">here</a>)
contains some benchmark results.  With an artificial test aimed at demonstrating
the difference, the new code runs 25&nbsp;times faster.  By changing the
<tt>vmap()</tt> code in the XFS filesystem to use <tt>vm_map_ram()</tt>
instead, some workloads were sped up by a factor of twenty.  So it seems to
work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I've often wondered why processer designers didn't include an instruction to invalidate TLB entires directly. Tagged TLB entries are nice but for stuff like this a simple "throw out any TLB entires relating to address X" would solve most of the problems, no?<br>

I believe there are instructions to flush particular TLB entries -- invlpg for one. <br>
<p>
AFAICS the trouble in this case stems from the inefficiency of a global TLB flush.  Post a vfree() you have changed some global state on your *local* CPU.  However, the other remote TLBs don't know about this change in state and will happily resolve references to the vfree'd range unless told otherwise.  Thus, the IPIs to inform them to flush TLB.<br>

I don't think a TLB flush is needed on a uniprocessor machine as far as vmalloc() is concerned.<br>
<p>
Furthermore I am not quite sure which is the bigger problem here - flushing TLB on all CPUs....or the vmalloc()'s locking mechanism.<br>
<p>
Definitely the systems will 'grow' in means of more kernel memory allocations which in turn means more TLB flushes. However the RAM is getting faster which makes me think that a TLB flush is getting less of a hassle as compared to global locks which can definitely become more and more serious as the number of CPU cores grows in time :)<br>

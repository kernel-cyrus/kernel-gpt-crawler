           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 13, 2022</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
At the 
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM), Amir Goldstein
and Miklos Szeredi led a discussion on a new interface for extracting
information from kernel objects using the filesystem extended-attributes
(xattr) interface.  Since Szeredi was not present in Palm Springs, he co-led
the session virtually over Zoom audio, which was the only
filesystem session with a virtual leader at LSFMM this year.  Szeredi's <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YnEeuw6fd1A8usjj@miu.piliscsaba.redhat.com/">proposal</a>
for an interface of that sort had been posted just the day before the session. 
</p>

<p>
Goldstein started things off by noting that there are several use cases
where there is a need for a new API to obtain bits of information from the
kernel, so it seems like a good idea to create a common API that can meet
those needs.  Szeredi proposed the <tt>getfattr</tt> mechanism, which builds
on the xattr interface; Goldstein said that he was happy with the idea, as
were Szeredi and Dave Chinner, who suggested the idea a year or so ago.  In
addition, other than an <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YnFB/ct2Q/yYBnm8@kroah.com/">objection to binary
data</a>, Greg Kroah-Hartman was "not unhappy" with the idea.
</p>

<p>
Szeredi took over to describe the proposal in more detail.  The intent is
to be able to get attributes from some kernel objects; those could be mounts
or inodes, but processes or other objects are possible as well.  There are
several existing interfaces for getting this kind of information, but each
has a different way to access the attributes, so it would be nice to have a
unified interface, he said. 
</p>

<p>
The xattr API was repurposed for his proposal.  It uses a different
namespace for the new attributes, however, in order to ensure that legacy code will not
break due to unexpected new attributes.  For example, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listxattr.2.html"><tt>listxattr()</tt></a>
would not return attributes from the new namespace.  One objection to the
interface is that it is not efficient enough if there is a need to retrieve
multiple attributes.  Szeredi said that would need to be tested to see if
it is truly a problem, but if so, the API could be extended with a
bulk-retrieval mechanism.
</p>

align="right" alt="[Amir Goldstein]" title="Amir Goldstein" width=203
height=300>
</a>

<p>
Goldstein said that the same interface could be used for a
"<tt>setfattr</tt>" tool that
could set attributes; he wondered if there were any objections to the
general 
idea.  David Howells said that he had some "potential objections" that are
likely surmountable: for example, <tt>getfattr</tt> does not have the right security
checks.  It should either have no security checks or ones like the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statfs.2.html"><tt>statfs()</tt></a>
system call has.  The checks required could be based on the namespace being
queried, so that Linux security module (LSM) checks could be accommodated
as needed.
</p>

<p>
Howells would also rather see the information be returned as binary data,
rather than strings, especially for things that need to be retrieved
quickly.  He has gotten messages from some developers who liked his <a
href="/Articles/829212/"><tt>fsinfo()</tt> proposal</a> because it returned
data in binary form, so there was no need to parse it.  Goldstein said that
others want to be able to use <tt>getfattr</tt> in shell scripts, however.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to have a simple and flexible generic interface, he said.  If
there is a need for higher performance, then once that has been demonstrated, 
a different interface can be added. Howells said that there is a need for
systemd to be able to read a list of thousands of mounts; it will need
higher performance.  But Goldstein said that most systems do not have
thousands of mounts; another interface that is less simple and generic can
be added for those kinds of use cases.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that the interface being proposed is not for reading lists of
thousands of mounts, but is, instead, for getting information like: "what is
the mount point for that particular file or directory?"  Thousands of mount
points are a reality on production systems at Google, he said, but this
interface is not meant for that case.  
In his mind, <tt>getfattr</tt> is the non-controversial part; it is the
<tt>setfattr</tt> piece that has not been specified which requires a lot more
consideration.  There are questions of which attributes can be set, what
the permissions required are, how the interface can be introspected, and so
on.  If the setting interface is not done right, he said that Luis
Chamberlain would eventually have to give a talk to complain that it is just as <a
href="/Articles/897202/">bad as <tt>ioctl()</tt> is</a>.  If
<tt>getfattr</tt> is the camel's nose under the tent for an unseen set
interface, that worries Ts'o.
</p>

<p>
Christian Brauner said that the systemd developers should get an
opportunity to weigh in on the proposal.  There are longstanding bugs and
serious performance issues that the tool has experienced when gathering
mount properties on thousands of mounts on production workloads.  That is
part of what is driving the <tt>fsinfo()</tt>-style of interface.  Brauner
thinks it is important to address those problems in any kind of proposal of
this sort.
</p>

<p>
Howells said that some kind of "get mountlist" call might be sufficient to
solve the specific problems that systemd is experiencing.  Goldstein said
that it was not necessary for this proposal to solve all of the problems,
however.  The problem for systemd is that a single change to the mounted
filesystems requires it to rescan the mount tree because it does not get
notified of what the change is, only that something has changed, Szeredi said.  If the
notification could somehow be improved, that might solve systemd's problem.
</p>

<p>
Goldstein said that the proposal email showed a static hierarchy of
attributes but that the hierarchy can be extended flexibly such that each
filesystem type could have its own namespace.  The CIFS filesystem already does
that for both getting and setting attributes in a <tt>cifs.*</tt> namespace. 
Brauner asked what the new system call underlying <tt>getfattr</tt> looked
like.  Goldstein replied that it was simply using <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getxattr.2.html"><tt>getxattr()</tt></a>.
The difference is in the interpretation of the namespaces that are included
in the path name argument.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that it did not really make sense for ext4 to switch to this
xattr-based mechanism, since it already has a way for programs to retrieve
ext4-specific information via sysfs.  That code must be maintained for
backward compatibility, so adding more code to support the xattr-based
mechanism is not attractive.
Trying to force all filesystems and
applications to use the proposed interface for filesystem-dependent
information is probably a bad idea, he said.  Any filesystem that wants to
use it, should go ahead and do so, however.  He just does not see any real
value for ext4.
</p>

<p>
Brauner suggested making it a different system call, even if it is actually
using the same <tt>getxattr()</tt> code underneath.  The current
expectation for xattrs is that they are stored on disk associated with a
file, which is not the case for "fattrs".  Goldstein agreed that it
probably makes sense to do so.  Two other things to consider are adding a
<tt>getxattrat()</tt> system call and, perhaps, a way to get multiple
xattrs in a single call, he said.  XFS has an <tt>ioctl()</tt> command for
getting multiple xattrs, which could perhaps be generalized.  With that,
the session ran out of time, but it seems that the xattr-based approach
will continue to be pushed forward.

alternate data streams (at least on Windows) have the same size limits as regular files, xattrs are limited in size. They are commonly used to exfiltrate data from &quot;foreign&quot; systems by the CIA (seriously, look up the tools that got leaked :-). They can be used to store an alternate executable so long as the name ends in .EXE (Ted Tso once showed me a screenshot of the Process Manager showing a process called &quot;MyFile.txt&quot; running :-). ADS are a virus-writers best friend. I&#x27;m not even sure a Linux implementation would make Samba&#x27;s job easier, as there almost certainly would be material differences that would make using them a pain for Windows clients (on Windows they even have different namespace rules from the regular NTFS filesystem).<br>

<p>
Well, sure, but you can already do that without ADS – you can just point CreateProcess() at any file name, regardless of its extension, and as long as it contains a PE executable it will run. The &quot;Command Prompt&quot; shell (cmd.exe) will happily run a .zip or a .txt without any alternate stream shenanigans.<br>

This has more to do with the way ADS are implemented in Windows. Up until Windows Vista (AFAIR) it was not even possible to get the _list_ of streams for a file, except via very obscure backup-related API. And streams in Windows are also numbered, not named. <br>
<p>
I believe it&#x27;s possible to make it much more transparent, and with obvious safeguards it should be much safer than it is in Windows. It also is a very nice feature in general, if exploited to its full potential (like Data Fork in the old MacOS).<br>
<p>
But yeah, nobody wants ADS right now.<br>

The windows path-munging stuff related to ADS is also frequently unexpected, and results in surprise. <br>
<p>
xattrs are supported on windows too.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;m not sure ADS are really a severe security problem though, <br>

xattrs in Windows are not accessible via the Win32 API. You have to use native system calls, or you can get to them via SMB1/2/3 over the network (which is how I know about them :-).<br>

Ceph, which is not a filesystem, but store data, nevertheless, is already have &#x27;omaps&#x27; (which is a simple kv storage).<br>
<p>
But they are at object level (er.. file level), that means you need to create it with name. It&#x27;s like xattr, but on steroids, and with network-wide redundancy.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Goldstein said that others want to be able to use getfattr in shell scripts, however. </font><br>
<p>
Shell scripts wouldn&#x27;t be calling the syscall directly, but instead would call some executable to perform the syscall on its behalf. I would expect *that* to output text, but what does that have to do with the syscall return format (besides less work for a `getfattr(1)` author)?<br>

Obviously, getfattr(1) would need to know how to print any particular attribute. But that&#x27;s an advantage of using binary results, since making it possible to write a getfattr(1) that doesn&#x27;t need to be rebuilt for every kernel is a way to make getfattr(2) not as bad as ioctl. (That is, the kernel would be telling you what data structure you get for each attribute.)<br>

I have rarely used xattr... but if this proposal is accepted and the feature is implemented then it is likely to use xattr in the future.<br>

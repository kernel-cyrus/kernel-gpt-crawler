<h1>Kernel Summit: Network summit summary</h1>

</td></tr></table>

One week prior to the kernel summit, a small group got together in Oregon
for a two-day networking summit.  By all accounts from those who were
present, the summit was a focused and effective event.  Stephen Hemminger
summarized the results for the kernel group; he also maintains <a
href="http://developer.osdl.org/shemminger/ns2004/">a web site</a> with
materials from the networking summit.
<p>

The networking folks have a long "to do" list, but few of the items on that
list call for major changes.  In the IPv6 area, there is a need for better
load balancing and use of equivalent routes, and multicast routing still
needs to be done (in a cleaner manner than it was done for IPv4).  There is
also still a major lack of useful performance data for the IPv6 stack; the
developers have little idea of whether they perform well or not.  There are
plans in the works to support mobile IPv6, a protocol which lets you plug
in anywhere and communicate over a tunnel back to your ISP.  The tunneling
code needs work in general to communicate tunnel status back to user space,
and to provide a more generic tunneling capability.  The networking layer
increasingly needs to work with long timeouts, which will drive a push
toward using 64-bit timers in the kernel.
<p>
There is also, we were warned, a big reshuffle coming for the network
portion of the kernel source tree.
<p>
In the security area, there are plans to drop CIPE altogether and use the
OpenVPN standard.  The crypto support layer needs improvement, including
crypto hardware support and an asynchronous mode suited to use in bottom
half handlers.  Netfilter needs some performance work, perhaps extending to
the creation of a "grand unified flow cache" which would minimize the
number of passes required on each packet.  Nonlinear SKBs do not fit well
with the netfilter way of looking at things, and performance suffers
accordingly.
<p>

Things are coming together in the area of 802.11 stacks; Jeff Garzik's new
development tree centered around HostAP will help in that area.
<p>

UDP fragmentation suffers from an "ID wrapping" problem which could lead to
security issues; it needs to be fixed.  <a
href="http://www.rdmaconsortium.org/home">RDMA</a> is an area of increasing 
interest; believe it or not, the networking developers think that using TCP
offload capabilities on network adaptors may be appropriate for this case.
Some cards also offer "receive collation offload," essentially the
reassembly of incoming TCP streams; the Linux stack may eventually take
advantage of that.  Asynchronous I/O support was discussed; it may be added
for the transmit side, but few people see a need for it when reading from
network sockets.  There is continued work in TCP congestion control; a few
algorithms have been added to the kernel, but nobody has yet figured out
which ones actually perform well.
<p>

Future work may include the implementation of <a
href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/rhee/export/bitcp/">TCP BIC</a> 1.1.  The
format of nonlinear SKBs may change; the various fragments will be stored
in the same sort of "scatterlist" used elsewhere in the kernel; this will
require a driver API change, however.  More IPSec work is needed.  <a
href="http://www.mplsrc.com/">MPLS</a> support is on the list.  And there
is talk of moving away from the route cache.

<p>
When did OpenVPN become a standard? And how does it relate to the kernel, being a pure user-space solution? It certainly makes sense to tell people to use OpenVPN instead of CIPE. As much as it sucks, though, the VPN standard is IPsec.

      I think this refers to discussion regarding the line "Integrate CIPE somehow, maybe even a 2.6.x task" under the heading "Misc. and CRAZY ideas" in David S. Miller's <a href="http://developer.osdl.org/shemminger/ns2004/net2_7.pdf">2.7.x Networking</a> talk.&nbsp; My best guess is that it was brought up in terms of integrating a simpler VPN than IPSec and it was immediately pointed out that CIPE was insecure and OpenVPN was a better starting point.

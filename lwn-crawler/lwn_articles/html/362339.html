           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 17, 2009</br>
           </div>
Contemporary networking hardware can move a lot of packets, to the point
that the host computer can have a hard time keeping up.  In recent years,
CPU speeds have stopped increasing, but the number of CPU cores is
growing.  The implication is clear: if the networking stack is to be able
to keep up with the hardware, smarter processing (such as <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/358910/">generic receive offload</a>) will
not be enough; the system must also be able to distribute the work across
multiple processors.  Tom Herbert's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/361440/">receive packet steering</a> (RPS) patch
aims to help make that happen.
<p>
From the operating system's point of view, distributing the work of
outgoing data across CPUs is relatively straightforward.  The processes
generating data will naturally spread out across the system, so the
networking stack does not need to think much about it, especially now that
multiple transmit queues are supported.  Incoming data is harder to
distribute, though, because it is coming from a single source.
Some network interfaces can help
with the distribution of incoming packets; they have multiple receive
queues and multiple interrupt lines.  Others, though, are equipped with a
single queue, meaning that the driver for that hardware must deal with all
incoming packets in a single, serialized stream.  Parallelizing such a
stream requires some intelligence on the part of the host operating system.
<p>
Tom's patch provides that intelligence by hooking into the receive path -
<tt>netif_rx()</tt> and <tt>netif_receive_skb()</tt> - right when the
driver passes a packet into the networking subsystem.  At that point, it
creates a hash from the relevant protocol data (IP addresses and port
numbers, in particular) and uses it to pick a CPU; the packet is then
enqueued for the target CPU's attention.  By default, any CPU on the system
is fair game for network processing, but the list of target CPUs for any
given interface can be configured explicitly by the administrator if need
be.
<p>
The code is relatively simple, but it succeeds in distributing the load of
receive processing across the system.  The use of the hash is important: it
ensures that packets for the same stream of data end up on the same
processor, increasing cache locality (and, thus, performance).  This scheme
is also nice in that it requires no driver changes at all, so it can be
deployed quickly and with minimal disruption.
<p>
There is one place where drivers can help, though.  The calculation of the
hash requires accessing data from the packet header.  That access will
necessarily involve one or more cache misses on the CPU running the
steering code - that data was just put there by the network interface and thus cannot
be in any CPU's cache.  Once the packet has been passed over to the CPU
which will be doing the real work, that cache miss overhead is likely to be
incurred again.  Unnecessary cache misses are the bane of high-speed
network processing; quite a bit of work has been done to eliminate them
wherever possible.  Adding a new cache miss for every packet in the
steering code would be counterproductive.
<p>
It turns out that a number of network interfaces can, themselves, calculate
a hash value for incoming packets.  That processing comes for free, and it
could eliminate the need to calculate that hash (and suffer the overhead of
accessing the data) on the dispatching processor.  To take advantage of
this capability, the RPS patch adds a new <tt>rxhash</tt> field to the
<tt>sk_buff</tt> (SKB) structure.  Drivers which are able to obtain hash values
from the hardware can place them in the SKB; the network stack will then
skip the calculation of its own hash value.  That should keep the packet's
data out of the dispatching CPU's cache entirely, speeding processing.
<p>
How well does this work?  The patch included some benchmark results using
the <tt>netperf</tt> tool.  An 8-core server with a tg3-based network
interface went from 90,000 transactions per second to 285,000; an
e1000-based adapter on the same system went from 90,000 to 292,000.
Similar results are obtained for nForce and bnx2x chipsets on 16-core
servers.  It would appear that this patch does succeed in making networking
processing faster on multi-core systems.
<p>
The patch, incidentally, comes from Google, which has a bit of experience
with network processing.  It has, evidently, been running on Google's
production servers for a while.  So the RPS patch is, hopefully, an early
component of what will be a broad stream of contributions from Google as
that company tries to work more closely with the mainline.  It seems like a
good start.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

How is this related to MSI-X, the system whereby network cards can assert different MSI interrupts based on a checksum in the header. This allows the load to be spread across CPUs in much the same way as suggested above.<br>
<p>
I'm also wondering how this interacts with PCAP. If you have a machine with a dozen processes attached to an interface, then the packet needs to be copied to several different places in userspace (assuming MMAP ring-buffers). These are all going to be running on different CPUs so I don't think the above processing will help. But perhaps the actual BPF filtering can be spread out over multiple CPUs?<br>
<p>
I ran into a problem this week, where IO-APIC round-robin interrupt routing is disabled on machines with &gt;= 8 CPUs, which means if you don't have MSI-X you have &gt;50% of one CPU dedicated to interrupt processing. The scheduler doesn't know this, leading to some odd effects. So if the above system works on ordinary MSI network cards this could be a solution,<br>

I think maybe you are referring to networking cards that provide multiple receive queues where each one can have a separate interrupt.  In some sense, RPS is a an emulation of this which is useful for "legacy" NICs that have only one queue.  Even so, we found that certain combinations if HW multiqueue and RPS actually can have better performance than just using HW multiqueue alone.<br>
<p>
With regards to PCAP, it's possible it may not help.  However, the technique of moving packets between CPUs might be applicable at a higher layer.<br>
<p>
This solution should definitely help if you don't have round robin interrupts (it's actually better because parallelism in the receive path).<br>

If the driver is not capable of getting the Hash from the hardware....<br>
is RPS still effective...? Does the implementation check if the capability is available and then enable RPS..?<br>

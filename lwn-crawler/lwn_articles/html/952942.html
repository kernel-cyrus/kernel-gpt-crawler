<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/osandov/drgn">drgn</a> Python-based kernel
debugger was developed by Omar Sandoval for use in his job on the kernel
team at Meta. He now spends most of his time working on drgn, both in
developing new features for the tool and in using
it to debug production problems at Meta, which gives him a view of both
ends of that feedback loop.  At the <a
href="https://lpc.events/event/17/page/198-lpc-2023-overview">2023 
Linux Plumbers 
Conference</a> (LPC), he led a session on drgn in the <a
href="https://lpc.events/event/17/sessions/167/#20231114">kernel debugging
microconference</a>, where he wanted to brainstorm on how to add some new
features to the debugger and, in particular, how to allow them to work on
production kernels.
</p>

<h4>Quick intro</h4>

<p>
Sandoval had a <a href="/Articles/789641/">presentation on drgn</a> (which
is pronounced "dragon") in 2019 that covered some of the basics of the
tool, which has presumably evolved since then.  He has given other in-depth
talks on drgn, he said, but he would just be doing a quick introduction to
the tool at the LPC session.  After that, he wanted to focus on the two
features, writing to memory and setting breakpoints, and to justify why his
team wants to be able to do those things on kernels running in production
("as crazy 
as it sounds").  He hoped that the brainstorming could come up with both a
mechanism for supporting the features and an API that is "friendly enough,
but also not so dangerous in the sense that you won't accidentally do
something that you 
didn't mean to do".
</p>

<a href="/Articles/953121/">

</a>

<p>
Drgn is a "programmable debugger"; rather than having built-in commands, it
provides building blocks, representations of kernel objects, types, stack
traces, and more, that can be used to create the tool needed for the
job at hand.  There are, for example, many kernel-specific helper functions
that provide access to various internal data structures, such as to find
task structures or to walk various slab caches.  Those can be used in an
interactive session and then turned into scripts that can be saved (or
shared with others) for the
next time a similar problem arises, he said.
</p>

<p>
He did a brief demo of drgn on a virtual machine on his laptop; the <a
href="https://youtu.be/68EBBgEltXA?t=18670">YouTube video</a> of the
presentation from the
conference livestream is available for the curious.  In the Python
read-eval-print loop (REPL), he had a handful of import statements
pre-typed and then proceeded to demonstrate some of the capabilities, such
as looking up the idle task using its variable name (<tt>init_task</tt>)
with one of the kernel helpers.
</p>

<p>
He also showed a loop using the
<tt>for_each_task()</tt> kernel helper that found the task structure for a
<tt>cat</tt> he had running in a shell; he could then print the stack
trace for that task, which had all of the symbol information, filenames,
and line numbers. He used the stack-frame number to index into an array to
further 
investigate a particular stack frame, including things like its local
variables and 
their values.  There are also a
large number of contributed scripts that consist of "people's debugging
sessions" that can be examined in addition to all of the helpers that come
with drgn.
</p>

<p>
All of what he had shown is read-only, however; you can read any memory in the
live kernel or in a kernel dump. But users have been asking for read-write
features for the live kernel for some time; that would allow overwriting
memory and setting breakpoints in the running kernel.  That makes sense for
development workflows, Sandoval said; drgn could attach to the kernel
running in QEMU using its GDB stub.  That functionality is something that
developers are used to when debugging, so he would like to support it in drgn. 
</p>

<p>
He has a proposed memory-writing API that, at its most basic level, just
takes a target address and buffer of bytes to write there, which makes the
user responsible for 
figuring out the right address and how to place the values into the buffer
correctly based on the kernel type.
On top of that would be a more user-friendly 
interface that would mirror the read side to a certain extent; objects can
be looked up, then their fields can be used as Python attributes, with drgn
ensuring that the write is done correctly.  It could potentially also take
a Python dictionary with structure fields as keys to write a structure with
those values.  The API is still up for debate as he has not implemented
anything yet.
</p>

<p>
"Breakpoints are a little more complicated, but not too much."  There are a
few different ways a user might want to set a breakpoint: by address,
function name, function name and offset, or filename and line number.  Then
handling any breakpoints might be done with a synchronous event loop, where
the events indicate which thread hit the breakpoint, allow access to
things like the stack trace and local variables for the stack frames, and
provide a way to resume the thread after the processing is done.
</p>

<p>
Once again, Sandoval said that he was interested in hearing about
simpler alternatives or use cases that still needed to
be covered. Chris Mason said that he wanted to be able to see when a
frequently called function is being called from some other specific
function; Sandoval said that could be done with his API just by looking at
the stack frame in the breakpoint and resuming unless it is being called by
the function of interest.  Another attendee suggested watchpoints for
memory, which Sandoval thought could be added to the API in a way similar to the
<tt>set_breakpoint()</tt> call he was proposing.
</p>

<p>
Because drgn is programmable, many of the different use cases can be
handled with programs of different sorts, he said.  If some of the use
cases need a
performance boost, perhaps BPF could be used to do things like pre-filter
breakpoints.  Another attendee suggested using drgn for doing error
injection in testing, which Sandoval thought could fit right in, though
there may be a 
need for a way to overwrite registers as part of the API.
</p>

<h4>Production</h4>

<p>
Those features are obviously useful in development, but his team at Meta
has run into a few scenarios where it would be helpful to be able use them
on production systems.  For example, there have been cases where being able to
overwrite some part of memory in the kernel would be enough to work around
an emergency that has gotten people out of bed.  It could be used to fix
reference counts that are not getting decremented correctly, reset overflows or
underflows of accounting information, change invalid states, and more.
</p>

<p>
A more concrete example is "an embarrassing bug in Btrfs" (fixed by <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=981a37bab5e5">this
commit</a>) where enabling asynchronous discard was not handled quite
correctly.  It manifested in reports of disks starting to run slowly, which
was eventually tracked down to discards (i.e. telling the device that
certain blocks are no longer 
used so that the it can do garbage collection on them) not being issued
at all.  After some "heroic debugging", the problem 
was tracked down and promptly fixed in the tree, but it would have been
convenient to be able to run a drgn script on affected machines to change
the single bit that would actually enable discard for the Btrfs mounts.
</p>

<p>
There are "a lot of caveats about doing this in production", though.  You
have to be careful about what you are overwriting—and when—"race conditions
are definitely a thing". It is not meant as a replacement for a live patch
or an updated kernel, but is instead a test of the fix and a stopgap
measure.  He hoped that explained the why, so he wanted to turn to "all the
crazy ways we might be able to do this".
</p>

<p>
For development, the solution is easy, Sandoval said, simply use the GDB
stub that is provided by QEMU.  He listed some possibilities for the
production use case, starting with bringing back <tt>/dev/kmem</tt>, which
is "almost a joke" of a suggestion.  He mentioned an <a
href="/Articles/851531/">LWN article</a> that celebrated its removal and he
noted that the <tt>/dev/kmem</tt> interface to read and write the kernel's
memory was a "beautiful thing for rootkits".  Drgn is not a rootkit, but
debuggers do share some elements with rootkits, so <tt>/dev/kmem</tt> would
be the "most straightforward way to support this, but I don't think anyone
is going to accept that patch". 
</p>

<p>
An alternative might be a custom kernel module that is effectively
<tt>/dev/kmem</tt>, which is not that much better, he said.  But, in order
to enable the feature, there will need to be some way to write values to an
arbitrary address, so the key will be in getting the access controls
right. BPF could perhaps be used, but that "kind of goes against everything
that 
BPF believes in, which is that your program should be safe".
</p>

<p>
Another possible approach would be to interface to <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kgdb.html">kgdb</a>,
though Meta does not enable it in production kernels "but it's not the
worst thing we could do".  Kgdb already supports both memory writes and
breakpoints, but, as far as he can tell, it was never intended to be used on
a live, running system.  For example, hitting a breakpoint stops every CPU,
so drgn cannot still be running; perhaps it could be modified to only stop
certain CPUs and leave one running for drgn.
</p>

<p>
An attendee asked why users would want other CPUs running when kgdb hits
a breakpoint.  The whole idea is that other CPUs cannot interfere with the
state of the kernel at the time of the breakpoint.  Sandoval said that
works fine when there is another system that is driving the debugging, but
that he wants to be able to log into a broken machine and run drgn there.
Another audience member said that if there is a breakpoint set, drgn could
cause it to be hit, leading to a deadlock.
</p>

<p>
Sandoval acknowledged that problem as a difficult one.  His idea is to have
a watchdog that would raise an non-maskable interrupt (NMI) to cancel the
breakpoint in the deadlock 
situation.
<a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/kprobes.html">Kprobes</a>
were identified as another way to do breakpoints, which Sandoval thought
might be 
workable.  There would still need to be a kernel module that alerted drgn
that the kprobe/breakpoint had been hit, as well as a watchdog for deadlock
prevention, he said.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/kernel_lockdown.7.html">kernel
lockdown mode</a> was brought up as a potential problem area by a participant;
it is meant to restrict any mechanisms that might alter the running kernel,
and may well be enabled on many production kernels.
So had Sandoval thought about how drgn might work with—or around—lockdown?
It probably makes sense to just disable drgn support on locked-down
kernels, Sandoval said.
</p>

<p>
When considering access control, the features that he wants to add to drgn
are things that already could be done from a custom kernel module, thus
<tt>CAP_SYS_MODULE</tt> and <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> could perhaps control
access to whatever underlying mechanism is decided upon.  There is the caveat
that some organizations require signed kernel modules beyond just having
the capabilities.  That might mean that the drgn mechanism needs to
validate the user based on keys on the kernel keyring in some fashion.
</p>

<p>
Stephen Brennan pointed out that Python itself loads lots of code from
various locations on the system that needs to be somehow protected so that
running 
drgn does not become a compromise vector.  Sandoval said that he "kind of
copped out and made it a per-user authentication thing", so that the user
has to be careful about those kinds of things, but that type of
access control has not worked out so well over the years, he said, pointing
to setuid binaries in particular.
</p>

<p>
Instead of having full breakpoints in drgn, Mason said, there could be a
limited set of things that can be done when the code is reached.  That
could then be turned into BPF or a kprobe, which would  then need to be inserted
into the kernel; it would not change the security picture at all, but would
simplify the problem of stopping all the CPUs and prevent the deadlocks.
Sandoval said that one of the things in that defined set would need to be
writing memory, however, so some solution for that part of the problem
would still be required.
</p>

<p>
As time ran out, he wrapped up by saying that he still had "more questions
than answers", 
but encouraged attendees to find him later to discuss "more bad ideas"—or
so that he could show them "cool drgn stuff", he said with a chuckle.

My talk at Kernel Recipes 2022 is a good introduction for anyone who hasn't played with drgn yet: <a href="https://youtu.be/ukxH_55BiQE">https://youtu.be/ukxH_55BiQE</a><br>
<p>
FWIW, the plan I ended up with is to first implement my proposed API with the first "backend" being the GDB stub for use with QEMU. Then I'll experiment with an out-of-tree kernel module providing the memory writing and breakpoint mechanisms behind some sort of access control (I'm still hand-waving that part).<br>

Would it also make sense to provide a libkdumpfile backend? Obviously not the breakpoints, but if write support in libkdumpfile gets implemented, wouldn't it make sense to use drgn for filtering out sensitive data from a dump file?<br>

Have you considered a scheme where instead of having a uapi to modify the kernel, you build on the livepatch framework? That is, the user thinks they're directly modifying code/data, but drgn instead builds a kernel module to do it. That kernel module could then be signed (if one is in that kind of environment) and modprobed (with the usual security checks).<br>

Sounds good to me.<br>

Besides, this scheme would probably require an explicit SYNC operation, and that would be also very useful for a dumpfile backend.<br>

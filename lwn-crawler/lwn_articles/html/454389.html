<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 15, 2011</br>
           </div>
CPUs may not have gotten hugely faster in recent years, but they have
gained in other ways; a typical system-on-chip (SoC) device now has a
number of peripherals which would qualify as reasonably powerful CPUs in
their own right.  More powerful devices with direct access to the memory
bus can take on more demanding tasks.  For example, an image frame captured
from a camera device can often be passed directly to the graphics processor
for display without all of the user-space processing that was once
necessary.  Increasingly, the CPU's job looks like that of a shop foreman
whose main concern is keeping all of the other processors busy.
<p>
The foreman's job will be easier if the various devices under its control
can communicate easily with each other.  One useful addition in this area
might be the <a href="/Articles/455098/">buffer sharing patch set</a>
recently posted by Marek Szyprowski.  The idea here is to make it possible
for multiple kernel subsystems to share buffers under the control of user
space.  With this type of feature, applications could wire kernel
subsystems together in problem-specific ways then get out of the way,
letting the devices involved process the data as it passes through.
<p>
There are (at least) a couple of challenges which must be dealt with to
make this kind of functionality safe to export to applications.  One is
that the application should not be able to "create" buffers at arbitrary
kernel addresses.  Indeed, kernel-space addresses should not be visible to
user space at all, so the kernel must provide some other way for an
application to refer to a specific buffer.  The other is that shared
buffers must not go away until all users have let go of it.  A buffer may
be created by a specific device driver, but it must persist, even if the
device is closed, until nobody else expects it to be there.
<p>
The mechanism added in this patch set (this part in particular is credited
to Tomasz Stanislawski) is relatively simple - though it will probably get
more complex in the future.  Kernel code wanting to make a buffer available
to other parts of the kernel via user space starts by filling in one of
these structures:
<p>
<pre>
    struct shrbuf {
    	void (*get)(struct shrbuf *);
    	void (*put)(struct shrbuf *);
    	unsigned long dma_addr;
    	unsigned long size;
    };
</pre>
<p>
One could immediately raise a number of complaints about this structure:
the address should be a <tt>dma_addr_t</tt>, there's no reason not to put
the kernel virtual address there, only physically-contiguous buffers are
allowed, etc.  It also seems like there could be value in the ability to
annotate the state of the buffer (filled or empty, for example) and
possibly signal another thread when that state changes.
But it's worth remembering that this is an explicitly
proof-of-concept patch posting and a lot of things will change.  In
particular, the eventual plan is to pass a scatterlist around instead of a
single physical address.
<p>
The <tt>get()</tt> and <tt>put()</tt> functions are important: they manage
reference counts to the buffer, which must continue to exist until that
count goes to zero.  Any subsystem depending on a buffer's continued
existence should hold a reference to that buffer.  The <tt>put()</tt>
function should release the buffer when the last reference is dropped.
<p>
Once this structure exists, it can be passed to:
<p>
<pre>
	int shrbuf_export(struct shrbuf *sb);
</pre>
<p>
The return value (if all goes well) will be an integer file descriptor
which can be handed to user space.  This file descriptor embodies a
reference to the buffer, which now will not be released before the file
descriptor is closed.  Other than closing it, there is very little that the
application can do with the descriptor other than give it to another kernel
subsystem; attempts to read from or write to it will fail, for example.
<p>
If a kernel subsystem receives a file descriptor which is purported to
represent a kernel buffer, it can pass that descriptor to:
<p>
<pre>
    struct shrbuf *shrbuf_import(int fd);
</pre>
<p>
The return value will be the same <tt>shrbuf</tt> structure (or an
<tt>ERR_PTR()</tt> error value for a file descriptor of the wrong type).  A
reference is taken on the structure before returning it, so the recipient
should call <tt>put()</tt> at some future time to release it.
<p>
The patch set includes a new Video4Linux2 <tt>ioctl()</tt> command
(<tt>VIDIOC_EXPBUF</tt>) enabling the exporting of buffers as file
descriptors; a couple of capture drivers have been augmented to support
this functionality.  No examples of the other side (importing a buffer)
have been posted yet.
<p>
There has been relatively little commentary on the patch set so far,
possibly because it was posted to a couple of relatively obscure mailing
lists.  It has the look of functionality that could be useful beyond one or
two kernel subsystems, though.  It would probably make sense for the next
iteration, which presumably will have more of the anticipated functionality
built into it, to be distributed more widely for review.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I remember being told about IBM's Micro Channel architecture (MCA) and its ability to let devices talk directly to each other across the MCA bus, without involving the CPU.  I imagine this was never really used in PC-compatible systems although it might have been in certain MCA-based mainframes or RS/6000 systems.  There might also be the chance for two disks attached to the same controller to copy data directly between themselves without going through the host system at all.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
The shunting in and out of user space is easy to eliminate: mmap.
<p>
That leaves you with the copying from one device's buffer to the other.  For that, Linus invented the 'splice' system call about ten years ago and, as justincormack points out in another comment on this article, actually implemented in 2005.  Splice takes two file descriptors and a length as arguments and reads that many bytes from one of the devices and writes it to the other, by DMAing into, then out of, the same memory.
https://lwn.net/Articles/119682/ .  I don't know what the current state of deployment is, though.
<p>
The MCA thing would presumably be the next step, where the data doesn't have to stop over in system memory.
<p>
In big systems, where the storage devices are rather separate from the CPUs, this exists in the form that you can tell a device to send some of its contents directly to another device, e.g. through a fibre channel network.  I guess the same thing over a PCI-class network can't be far behind.
<p>
In fact, my guess is that the bus protocol itself allows this in PCI Express and Infiniband; I don't think the CPU/main memory is particularly special in those protocols.  Does somebody know?

the funny thing is that plan 9 has been able to do this<br>

What's wrong with just using the virtual address space of the current process? (the good old void* p, size_t size)<br>
<p>
If the issue is accessibility via restricted DMA, then add some way to mmap ZONE_DMA or similar memory.<br>
<p>
If the issue is physical contiguity, add support to mmap contiguous memory.<br>
<p>
If the issue is synchronous IO, make the APIs asynchronous.<br>

Building pagetables is certainly more expensive than not doing so; this patch just separates the concepts of get-handle-to-kernel-memory and pin-kernel-memory-for-direct-access, which seems entirely sensible. See also sendfile(), which is a special case of splice(). <br>
<p>
I *think* splice() should be able to accomplish the same feats as this patchset providing both ends can provide an FD that adequately represents what we want to do with the buffer; e.g. in the case that we're piping network packets to a video device, the video driver needs to be able to provide an FD representing the target video buffer, pixel format, etc, so something like:<br>
<p>
// fd is a socket<br>
int fd2 = ioctl(video_control_fd, IOCTL_GET_SINK_FD, /* description of sink buffer */);<br>
splice(fd, fd2, ...);<br>
<p>
In the language of this patchset the network driver would provide an ioctl that yields a buffer FD, and the video driver would provide one that copies buffer data into specified video memory.<br>
<p>
int bufferfd;<br>
int fd = ioctl(socket_or_if_control_fd, IOCTL_GET_PACKET_BUFFER, &amp;bufferfd);<br>
ioctl(video_control_fd, IOCTL_COPY_BUFFER_TO_VMEM, fd2, /* buffer description */);<br>
<p>
Basically a splice()-based approach would need more ioctls in order to establish something that looks like a "connection endpoint" that means what we want it to, but mean less FD table operations if we want to repeatedly perform a similar operation (likely?), whilst an ioctl() + fd-per-buffer approach means lots of fd table operations (efficient locks in the table?) but less syscalls if we're routing buffers in a way that would effectively compel a splice operation to create a new channel per operation.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 7, 2025</br>
           </div>
Linus Torvalds <a href="/Articles/1016576/">released 6.15-rc1</a> and
closed the 6.15 merge window on April&nbsp;6.  By that time, 12,633
non-merge changesets had found their way into his repository; that is
substantially more than were merged during the entire 6.14
development cycle.  Just under 6,000 of those changesets were merged after
<a href="/Articles/1015414/">the first-half merge-window summary</a> was
written.
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->
Some of the most interesting changes from the second half of the 6.15 merge
window are:
<p>


<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The RISC-V architecture has gained support for the <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format">BFloat16</a>
     floating-point extension, the <a
     href="https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-announce/topic/public_review_for_zaamo_and/104583551">Zaamo
     and Zalrsc</a> extensions, and the <a
     href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bitmanip/blob/main/bitmanip/zbkb.adoc">ZBKB</a>
     extension.


</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The function and function-graph tracers have gained the ability to
     record the arguments to called functions; those arguments can then be
     examined in the trace output.
<li> The io_uring subsystem now supports zero-copy reception of network
     data, with eventual plans for allowing reception directly into device
     memory.  See <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d9ac1d5fc951">this
     commit</a> for documentation.
<li> It is also now possible to read epoll events via an io_uring
     operation.  From <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6df9d086ffcb">the
     merge message:</a>
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	While this may seem counter-intuitive (and/or productive), the
  	reasoning here is that quite a few existing epoll event loops can
  	easily do a partial conversion to a completion based model, but are
  	still stuck with one (or few) event types that remain readiness
  	based.
<p>
  	For that case, they then need to add the io_uring fd to the epoll
  	context, and continue to rely on epoll_wait(2) for waiting on
  	events.  This misses out on the finer grained waiting that io_uring
  	can do, to reduce context switches and wait for multiple events in
  	one batch reliably.
<p>
	  With adding support for reaping epoll events via io_uring, the
  	  whole legacy readiness based event types can still be reaped via
  	  epoll, with the overall waiting in the loop be driven by
  	  io_uring.
</blockquote>
<li> The BPF subsystem has gained improved verification of programs with
     loops, some new <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=880442305a39">load-acquire
     and store-release instructions</a>, the ability to change 
     extended attributes on files within BPF programs, and <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3a6fa573c50f">a
     timed <tt>may_goto</tt> instruction</a>.
<li> Also new in BPF is a "resilient queued spinlock" locking
     primitive.  Its main purpose is to detect deadlock conditions at run
     time, enabling the loading of programs for which the verifier is
     unable to prove locking correctness.  See <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6ffb9017e932">this
     merge message</a> for an overview of these locks, and <a
     href="https://github.com/kkdwivedi/rqspinlock/blob/main/rqspinlock.pdf">this
     white paper</a> for details.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/1014220/#bpf"><tt>try_alloc_pages()</tt> allocation
     function</a>, which allows for memory allocation in any context (with
     a relatively high chance of failure) has been merged.  It is intended
     to support BPF programs that may be running in highly restricted
     contexts.  (See also: <a href="/Articles/1016001/">this article</a>
     from LSFMM+BPF 2025).
<li> It is now possible to check for the existence of guard pages in
     <tt>/proc</tt>; this addresses a regression (of sorts) experienced in
     some systems.  It is also now possible to place guard pages in
     file-backed memory.  See <a href="/Articles/1011366/">this article</a>
     for information about both changes.
<li> The tracking of mapping counts for large folios <a
     href="/Articles/1013649/">has been significantly reworked</a>.  The
     end result should be better tracking overall (and hopefully fewer
     security problems), but possibly slightly fuzzier working-set
     statistics.
<li> The page allocator has <a href="/Articles/1014220/">seen some
     significant changes</a> that are intended to greatly increase the
     reliability of huge-page allocations.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The filesystems in user space (FUSE) subsystem can now enforce
     timeouts on requests, enabling recovery when the user-space server
     becomes unresponsive.  <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9b17cb59a7db">This commit</a>
     describes the sysctl knobs that control this feature.  FUSE can also
     now handle file names longer than 1,024 characters.


</ul>

<p>

<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>Clock</b>:

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The "fwctl" subsystem, designed to pass command data directly through
     to complex firmware systems, has been merged.  This subsystem <a
     href="/Articles/969383/">has been controversial</a> in the past, but
     <a href="/Articles/990802/">a 2024 Maintainers Summit session</a> came
     to the conclusion that it should be merged.  There are three drivers
     included with this merge, one for CXL devices, one for mlx5 adapters,
     and one for AMD/Pensando distributed services cards.  There is <a
     href="https://origin.kernel.org/doc/html/next/userspace-api/fwctl/">some
     documentation</a> included with this new subsystem.
<li> The perf subsystem has gained the ability to perform latency
     profiling using scheduler information.  See <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=802f0d58d52e">this
     commit</a> for details, and for information on other perf enhancements
     added this time around.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html">Landlock</a>
     security module has a new auditing mechanism that is intended to make
     it easier to understand access denials.  <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8e2dd47b10e7">This
     commit</a> contains documentation.
<li> The kernel may now optionally <a href="/Articles/1006375/">seal a
     number of memory mappings</a> against changes as a hardening measure.
     This feature was somewhat controversial because it is likely to break
     some applications, so it is disabled by default.  Whether any
     distributors will dare to enable it remains to be seen.  See <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a8c15bb4008c">this
     documentation commit</a> for some more information.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/857862/">runtime verification subsystem</a> has
     a new feature called "scheduler specification monitors" that allows
     multiple monitors to run concurrently and interact with each other.
     <a
     href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=03abeaa63c08">This
     commit</a> contains documentation for this new feature.
<li> The new <tt>traceoff_after_boot</tt> command-line parameter will cause
     tracing to be disabled once the kernel has booted and started the
     <tt>init</tt> process.  It is intended to help with the tracing of
     boot-related problems, ensuring that the trace data is not overwritten
     by the time a human is able to look at it.
<li> There is now support for running unit tests within Rust code with the
     new <tt>#[kunit_tests()]</tt> macro.
<li> New Rust abstractions cover high-resolution timers and coherent DMA
     mapping, which was the focus of <a href="/Articles/1006805/">some
     disagreement</a> earlier this year.
<li> There were 451 exported symbols removed and 447 added, for a net
     reduction of four.  There are also twelve new kfuncs in 6.15.  See <a
     href="/Articles/1016594/">this page</a> for the full list of additions
     and removals.
</ul>
<p>
This kernel now goes into the stabilization period, with the final 6.15
release happening on May&nbsp;25 or June&nbsp;1.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

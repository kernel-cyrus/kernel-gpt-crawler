The kernel development process features thousands of developers all working
together without stepping on each other's toes â€” very often, anyway.  The
modularity of the kernel is one of the biggest reasons for the smoothness
of the process; developers rarely find themselves trying to work on the
same code at the same time.  But there are always exceptions, one of which
is the large, cross-subsystem patch series.  Merging such a series does not
have to be a recipe for trouble, especially if a few guidelines are
followed; this article offers some suggestions in that direction.
<p>

Changing the whole kernel tree using a pattern has become a lot easier in
recent years. There
is more processing power available, example scripts are out there, and
tools like 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/380835/">Coccinelle</a> are especially targeted
for such tasks.

While this is great for wide-ranging work like API changes and bug fixes
across all drivers, 
handling a patch series spanning across various subsystems can be a bit
cumbersome. Dependencies and responsibilities need to be clear, the granularity
(i.e. number of patches) needs to be proper, and relevant information needs to
reach all people involved. If these conditions are not met, maintainers
might miss important 
details which means more work for both the submitter and the maintainer. The
best practices described below are intended to make submitting such a patch
series smooth and to avoid this unnecessary work.

<p>
<h4>Patch organization</h4>
<p>
The first question to answer is: in what form should your
changes be posted? Here are the 
most commonly used choices along with examples of when they were
used. There are no 
strict rules when to use which approach (and there can't be), so the examples
hopefully give you an idea what issues to consider and what might be
appropriate for your series.
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Changing the whole tree at once</b>: 

Having one patch changing files tree-wide in one go has the advantage of
immediately changing the API (no transition time). Once applied, it is done,
ready, and there should be no cruft left over. Because only one maintainer
is needed to merge the 
huge patch, this person can easily handle any dependencies that might
exist. The major drawback is a 
high risk of merge conflicts all over the tree because so many subsystems are
touched. This approach was used for <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1579901">renaming
<tt>INIT_COMPLETION()</tt> to <tt>reinit_completion()</tt></a>.

<p>
<li><b>Grouping changes per file</b>: 

Having one patch for every modified file gives each subsystem maintainer 
freedom regarding when to apply the patches and how to handle merge
conflicts because 
the patches do not cross subsystems. However, if there are dependencies, this
can become a nightmare ("Shall I apply patches 32-53 to my tree now? Do I have
to wait until 1-5 are applied? Who does that? Or is there a V2 of the series
coming?"). Also, a huge number of patches pollutes the Git history. This
choice was 
used for <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1575149">removing
<tt>platform_driver_probe()</tt></a> from bus masters like I2C and SPI. It was
chosen to provide a more fine-grained bisectability in case something went
wrong.

<p>

<li><b>Grouping changes per subdirectory</b>:

Having a patch per subdirectory somewhat resembles a patch per subsystem. This
is a compromise of the former two options. Fewer patches to handle, but still
each subsystem maintainer is responsible for applying and for conflict
resolution. When the pinctrl core became able to select the default state for
a group of pins, the explicit function call doing that in drivers was <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.dri.devel/93507">removed</a> in
this fashion. In another example, a number of drivers did sanity checks of
resources before 
passing them to <tt>devm_ioremap_resource()</tt>. Because the function does
its own checks already, the drivers could be <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.dri.devel/84891">cleaned up</a>
a little, one subdirectory at a time.  Finally, the notorious <a
href="/Articles/507794/">UAPI header file 
split</a> was also handled this way.

</p>

<li><b>Drop the series</b>: 

Finally, some tasks are just not suitable for mass conversion. One example is
changing device drivers to use the managed resources API
(<tt>devm_*</tt> and friends). There are surely some useful patterns to remove
boilerplate code here. Still, not knowing hardware details may lead to <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.i2c/17223">subtle
errors</a>. Those will probably be noticed for popular drivers, but may
introduce regressions for less popular ones. So, those patches should be tested
on real hardware before they are applied. If you really want to do a series
like this as a service to the community, you should then ask for and collect
<tt>Tested-by</tt> tags. Expect the patches to go in individually, not as a
series.  Patches that do not get properly tested may never be applied.
</ol>

<p>

Of course, the decision of which form to use should be driven by technical
reasons 
only, patch count statistics, in particular, should not be a concern. As mentioned
before, there are no hard rules, but you can assume that changing the whole
tree at once is usually frowned upon unless the dependencies require it.
Also, try to keep the number of patches low without sacrificing flexibility.
That makes changes per subdirectory a good start if you are unsure. In any
case, say in the cover letter what you think would be best. Be open for
discussion because approaches do vary. For example, I would have
preferred if the removal of <tt>__dev*</tt> attributes would have been one huge
patch instead of 358 small ones. As a result, be prepared to
convert your series from one form into another.

<p>

Note: To automatically create commits per subdirectory with <tt>git</tt>,
the following snippet can be used as a basis.  It reads a commit message
template specified by <tt>$commit_msg_template</tt> to create the commit
descriptions.  There, it replaces the string <tt>SEDME</tt> with the
directory currently being processed.

<p>
<pre>
    dirs=$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no $startdir | \
	 dirname $(awk '/^ M / { print $2 }') | sort -u)

    for d in $dirs; do
        git add --update $d/*.[ch]
        sed "s|SEDME|${d//|/\|}|" $commit_msg_template | git commit --quiet -F -
    done
</pre>
<p>
An example commit message template might look like::
<p>
<pre>
    SEDME: calling foo() in drivers is obsolete

    foo() is called by the core since commit 12345678 ("call foo() in core").
    No need for the driver to do it.

<h4>The procedure</h4>
<p>

With any patch series, the good old "release early, release often" rule holds
true. Let people know what you are up to. Set up a public repository,
push your 
complete branch there, and update it regularly. If the series is not trivial,
send an RFC to collect opinions. For an RFC, it may be appropriate to start
by patching
only one subsystem rather than the whole tree, or to use a whole-tree patch this
one time in order to keep the mail count low. Always send a cover letter and
describe your aim, dependencies, public repositories, and other relevant
information. 
<p>
Ask Fengguang Wu to build your branch with his great <a
href="https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/kbuild">kbuild test service</a>.
When all issues are resolved and there are no objections, send the whole series
right away. Again, don't forget a proper cover letter. In case of per-file or
per-directory patches, the subsystem maintainers will pick up the
individual patches as they see fit.
Be prepared for this process to take longer than one development cycle. In that
case, rerun your pattern in the next development cycle and post an updated
series. Keep at it until done.

<p>

If it has been agreed to use the all-at-once approach, there may be
a subsystem maintainer willing to pick up your series and take care of needed
fixups during the merge window (or maybe you will be asked to do them). 
If there is no maintainer to pick your series but appropriate
<tt>Acked-by</tt> tags 
were given, then (and only then) it is up to you to send a pull request to
Linus. Shortly after the -rc1 release is a good time for this, though it is
best to agree on this timing ahead of time. Make sure you have reapplied
your pattern on the relevant -rc1 release so that the patches apply. Ask
Stephen Rothwell to pull 
your branch into linux-next. If all went well, send out the pull request to
Linus.
<p>
<h4>Whom to send the patches to</h4>

<p>

When you send the series, use <tt>git send-email</tt>.  The linux-kernel
mailing list is usually the best
<tt>--to</tt> recipient. Manually add people and lists to CC if they should
be
interested in the whole series. 
<p>
For other CCs, <tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> from
the kernel <tt>scripts</tt> directory is the tool to use. It supports custom
settings via <tt>.get_maintainer.conf</tt>, which must be placed in the kernel
top directory. The option <tt>--no-rolestats</tt> should be in that file; it
suppresses the printing of information about why an email address was
added. This extra output 
may confuse <tt>git</tt> and is also seen as noise on the mailing lists. The
other default options are sane, but the usage of <tt>--git-fallback</tt>
depends on the series you want to send. For per-file changes, it makes sense to
activate this feature, because it adds people who actually worked on the
modified files. For per-subsystem and whole-tree changes,
<tt>--no-git-fallback</tt> (the default) makes sense, because those changes
are mostly 
interesting for maintainers, so individual developers don't need to be on CC.
If they are interested in the series, they will usually read the mailing
list of the subsystem and notice your work there.
<p>

There is one last tricky
bit left: the cover letter. If it has too few CCs, people who receive
individual patches might miss it; they are then left wondering what the
patches are trying to accomplish.  On the other hand, copying
the cover letter to everybody who is also on CC of the patches will usually
result in 
rejected emails, because the CC list becomes too large. The rule of thumb here
is: add all mailing lists which get patches to the cover letter. Below is
a script that does exactly that. It can be used as a <tt>--cc-cmd</tt> for
<tt>git&nbsp;send-email</tt>. If it detects a cover letter, it runs
<tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> on all patches, collecting only mailing lists
(<tt>--no-m</tt> option.) If it detects a patch, it simply executes
<tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt>.
<p>

    shopt -s extglob
    cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) &gt; /dev/null

    name=${1##*/}
    num=${name%%-*}

    if [ "$num" = "0000" ]; then
        dir=${1%/*}
        for f in $dir/!(0000*).patch; do
            scripts/get_maintainer.pl --no-m $f
        done | sort -u
    else
        scripts/get_maintainer.pl $1
    fi
</pre>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
Applying patterns to the kernel tree is surely a useful tool. As with any
tool, knowledge when to use it and how to properly handle it needs to be
developed.  This article is hopefully a useful contribution in that
direction. The author hopes to inspire other developers and is open for
discussion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One more important bit: for the "whole tree" type changes, those changes generally are accepted only *immediately* before -rc1 at the very end of the merge window.  This requires (a) a priori consensus that the change is the Right Thing, and (b) coordination with Linus.  This is recommended only for experienced maintainers who already have working relationships with all the relevant people.<br>

<h1>Dropping x86 EISA support</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>January 21, 2015</br>
           </div>
<p>
It is clear that Paul Gortmaker thought there was a pretty good chance to
get rid of some old, unloved code when he <a
href="/Articles/630172/">proposed</a> 
dropping support for the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Industry_Standard_Architecture">EISA
bus</a> from 32-bit x86 kernels.  As he noted, when support for the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Channel_architecture">MCA bus</a>
was dropped 
in 2012, Linus Torvalds <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/5/17/278">mused</a> that perhaps EISA
could follow suit "<q>some day</q>".  Obviously Gortmaker hoped that
day had come, at least for the x86 architecture, but it seems he was a bit
premature.

<p>
As Gortmaker pointed out, there are some architectures that are essentially
"<q>frozen in time (from a hardware perspective)</q>"—he mentioned
Alpha and PA-RISC as examples—so EISA support cannot be completely removed
from the tree (as MCA was).  Removing it from x86 did not save much in the
way of code—it only deleted a little over 100 lines—but he had
something else in mind:
<div class="BigQuote">
Given that it is 20 years on since its demise, and the above specs
   might seem just barely acceptable for a wireless router today, lets
   stop forcing everyone to build EISA infrastructure and assoc. drivers
   during their routine build coverage testing for no value whatsoever.
</div>

<p>
But Maciej W. Rozycki was <a href="/Articles/630128/">not on board</a> with
the removal, noting that it is needed "<q>to support EISA FDDI [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDDI">Fiber Distributed Data Interface</a>]
equipment I maintain if nothing else</q>".  He suggested that perhaps it
could be hidden behind a configuration option for "<q>more exotic
stuff</q>" so that not everyone needed to build and test it.

<p>
Unsurprisingly, Torvalds was quick to <a href="/Articles/630129/">put the
kibosh</a> on EISA's removal: "<q>So if we actually have a user, and it works, then no, we're not
removing EISA support</q>".  But it is instructive to consider what
might have happened if Rozycki had not posted his disagreement.  It seems
quite possible 
that if no one spoke up for EISA on x86, it might well have been removed.

<p>
There is always some tension in the kernel community between those who want
to clean up and clear out "legacy" code and those who want to see it
continue to live in the mainline tree.  There is a cost associated with
maintaining legacy code, though, even if it rarely needs to change, and it does
continue to get built as part of various kernel-wide testing efforts.  That
puts some (possibly small) amount of burden on many other kernel
developers, most of whom 
are not interested in the old code at all.

<p>
As
certain kinds of hardware start to disappear entirely—from the kernel
developers' consciousness, at a minimum—it behooves those using Linux on that
hardware to 
pay attention to the kernel mailing list.  As seen here, real users who do
speak up will likely be able to block efforts to remove support, but timely
responses will be needed.  If a kernel release cycle or two goes
by, it may well be too late.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

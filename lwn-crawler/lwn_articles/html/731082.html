<p>
A bug that allows an attacker to overwrite a function pointer in the kernel
opens up a relatively
easy way to compromise the kernelâ€”doubly so, if an attacker simply
needs to wait for the kernel use the compromised pointer.  There are various
techniques that can be used to protect kernel function pointers that are
set at either compile or initialization time, but there are some pointers
that are routinely set as the kernel runs; timer completion functions are a
good example.  An RFC patch posted to the kernel-hardening mailing list
would add a way to detect that those function pointers have been changed
in an unexpected way and to stop the kernel from executing that code.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/730154/">patch</a> from Kees Cook is targeting a
class of vulnerabilities that arrange to overwrite the <tt>function</tt>
field in <tt>struct timer_list</tt>.  That field is the function that will
be called when the timer expires and it conveniently (from an attacker's
perspective) passes the next field in that structure (<tt>data</tt>) to the
function.  So an attacker who finds a way to overwrite <tt>function</tt>
can likely overwrite <tt>data</tt> as well, leading to a fairly
straightforward way to call some code of interest and to pass it an
argument. As Cook put it: "<q>This provides attackers
with a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP</a>-like
primitive for performing limited kernel 
function calls 
without needing all the prerequisites to stage a ROP attack.</q>" 
</p>

<h4>Exploits</h4>

<p>
In the patch, he pointed to two recent exploits that used this technique.
The first was <a
href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/12/06/1">described</a>
by its discoverer, Philip Pettersson, in December 2016.  It uses an
<tt>AF_PACKET</tt> socket (for raw socket handling as used by tools like
<tt>tcpdump</tt>) and manipulates the version of the packet-socket API
requested using <tt>setsockopt()</tt>.  By changing from
<tt>TPACKET_V3</tt> to <tt>TPACKET_V1</tt> at just the right time (to take
advantage 
of a race condition), his <a
href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40871/">demonstration exploit</a>
will cause the memory containing a <tt>timer_list</tt> to be freed without
deleting the timer.

<p>
So the timer object will be used by the kernel after
it has been freed.  By arranging for that memory to be reallocated
somewhere that the attacker can write to (Pettersson mentions using the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/add_key.2.html"><tt>add_key()</tt></a>
system call 
to do so), <tt>function</tt> and <tt>data</tt> can be overwritten.  In the
example, it actually does that twice, first to change the vsyscall table
from read-only to read-write, then to register a world-writable sysctl
(<tt>/proc/sys/hack</tt>) that sets the path of the <tt>modprobe</tt>
executable. It arranges that the exploit program gets run as
<tt>modprobe</tt> (as root), which leads to the execution of a root shell.
</p>

<p>
The second recent exploit was the subject of a lengthy <a
href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.mx/2017/05/exploiting-linux-kernel-via-packet.html">Project
Zero blog post</a> in May by Andrey Konovalov, who discovered the flaw
using the <a 
href="/Articles/677764/">syzkaller fuzzer</a>.  It uses a heap buffer
overflow in the <tt>AF_PACKET</tt> code.  By arranging the heap
appropriately and sending a packet with the contents of interest (the
exploit code, effectively), it will place the code into memory.
But that memory is user-space memory, and the Intel <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor_Mode_Access_Prevention">supervisor
mode access protection</a> (SMAP) and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_register#SMEP">supervisor mode
execution protection</a> (SMEP) features will prevent the kernel from
directly accessing or executing code there.  So Konovalov used the same
technique as Pettersson to simply disable those protections by calling
<tt>native_write_cr4()</tt> to change the CR4 register bits as the
expiration function of a socket timer.
</p>

<p>
Once that is done, it sets up a new compromised socket and ring buffer
combination that turns a transmit function pointer into a pointer to a
<tt>commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(0))</tt> call in user space.  Then
simply transmitting a packet using the socket invokes the code, which
gives the current process root privileges.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that both of these vulnerabilities can be
exploited by non-privileged users on distributions (e.g. Fedora, Ubuntu)
where user namespaces are enabled and unrestricted.  Both require the
<tt>CAP_NET_RAW</tt> capability to create packet sockets, which can be
acquired by unprivileged users by creating a new user namespace. While the
problem is not directly attributable to the user namespace code itself, it
does further highlight the dangers of expanding user privileges that
namespaces provide.  Both Pettersson and Konovalov warn against allowing
unprivileged users to create user namespaces.
</p>

<p>
Both also avoid kernel address-space layout randomization (KASLR), SMAP,
and SMEP protections.  Pettersson's exploit 
uses hardcoded offsets for the calls of interest to avoid KASLR, while
Konovalov reads <tt>dmesg</tt> to pluck out the kernel's text address.
SMAP/SMEP are either bypassed by using kernel memory directly (Pettersson)
or by explicitly disabling the features (Konovalov).
</p>

<h4>A possible fix</h4>

<p>
Cook's patch would add a <tt>canary</tt> field to <tt>struct
timer_list</tt> just prior to the <tt>function</tt> field.  When a timer is
initialized, the canary would be set to a value calculated by XORing the
addresses of the timer and the function, along with a random number that
only the kernel would know. The idea is that the canary value would also be
overwritten if the function pointer is. So, before calling the function when
the timer  
expires, the canary would be recalculated and compared with the stored
value; if they differ, the function pointer has been changed and will not
be called.  A warning will be logged as well.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Cook soon <a href="/Articles/731170/">realized</a> that his
patch was incomplete.  He had addressed timers that were set up using
the <tt>setup_timer_*()</tt> macros and the <tt>add_timer()</tt> function,
but missed many static timer initializations that use
<tt>DEFINE_TIMER()</tt>.   He promised a revised version of the patch to
handle that case. 
</p>

<p>
But it turns out that will require some extensive refactoring of the timer
code, he said in response to an email query.  That is a bigger job than he
expected, but does provide a nice cleanup, he said.  He may also have to
weaken the canary for the static timers, he said in the patch followup.  As
with many 
cross-subsystem patch sets that change code across the tree, getting something
like that 
into the mainline may be difficult.  Cook <a
href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2017-June/004536.html">outlined
some of the problems</a> he and others have encountered trying to do so in
a ksummit-discuss thread back in June. 
</p>

<p>
As the two exploits showed, though, the problem is real.  Some kind of
solution that would simply eliminate that class of vulnerabilities would be
welcome.   Whether Cook's canary can be that solution remains to be seen,
however.

I wonder if the canary itself adds very much value over just XORing the function and data values with a kernel-known random value.  That wouldn't prevent overwrites, but it *would* prevent them from going anywhere attacker-controlled.<br>

That could work too, but both require being able to either do the XOR or perform canary assignment at the moment of the timer callback function being assigned. This will still require extensive refactoring[1] to get rid of init_timer() and caller's resulting use of open-coded function assignments. I still prefer a full canary since then kernel doesn't freak out, it just flatly ignores the bad function. (Which also makes debugging easier.)<br>
<p>
In a perfect world, we could just identify all timer function callbacks by a common class and use CFI[2] to isolate timers to only calling timer callbacks. Until we have CFI, though, this seems like a nice change to make. (The refactoring is large but mostly mechanical, and would seem to have stand-alone benefit.)<br>

An alternative approach would be to eliminate function pointers in kernel code.  Surely any function pointer points to one of a small set of possible implementations.  It could be replaced with an enum and a trivial jump function which maps enum values to functions.  Then the most an attacker can do, if they manage to overwrite the enum value, is to cause control to jump to a different one of the functions in the set.<br>
<p>
An uglier approach, but perhaps easier to transition to, is to make a big static array (in a piece of generated C code) containing the address of every function in the kernel.  Then you replace function pointers with an index into this array.  Now an attacker can jump to an arbitrary kernel function, but not to arbitrary addresses.  A small refinement is to only store the needed functions in the array -- kernel functions which aren't currently referenced by function pointers don't need to appear.<br>
<p>
Would it be possible to use sparse or another static analyser to automate converting function pointer code to this style?<br>
<p>
In user space, could it have benefits too?<br>

      <P>You could, in principle, allow modules to register their entry points as well.  Perhaps structure it as a tuple, with <TT>&lt;module,entry&gt;</TT> pairs, with only the module part being determined dynamically at module-load time.</P>
<P>Indeed, we implemented something like this in a small secure-kernel + secure-module API that I helped develop for an embedded processor.  Each module defined its set of entry points, and received a load-time assigned module ID.  The module ID did require an extra level of indirection to find the entry point table for the module, so that was one downside.</P>

<P>This limits the attacker to only being able to select among the fixed list of entry points determined at compile time, while still permitting loadable modules.</P>
<P>Now, if someone could <tt>modprobe evil.ko</tt>, then yeah, they can subvert this.  But if they can do that, there are much shorter, more obvious paths to running their code.</P>

No, my question is; how can you make sure a good out-of-tree module can register a timer in such a scheme? That won't work if the tables are locked and live in read-only memory.<br>

      <P>I'm saying that each module provides its own table in an <tt>rodata</tt> type of section that can be mapped read-only.  The only dynamic run-time bit, then, is a module ID, which indexes a writable table of pointers to read-only tables of function pointers.  All of the tables of function pointers at least are read-only.</P>
<P>Something like this very rough sketch:</P>
<PRE>
/* This part lives in the kernel */
void *const kernel_fxn_ptrs[] = { ... };  /* this is read-only */
void *const *module_fxn_table_ptrs[MAX_MODULES];  /* this is read-write */

/* This part lives in each module */
void *const module_fxn_ptrs[] = { ... }; /* this is read-only */
</PRE>
<P>Now, since <tt>module_fxn_table_ptrs</tt> only needs modification at module load time, you could imagine spending the cost of establishing a writeable mapping to it during module load, and then discarding that writeable mapping once the module's table is registered.  That means you'd only have read-only tables for these function pointers under normal circumstances, with a small window during module load where a writeable mapping exists.</P>
<P>Of course, that idea assumes we don't have a full MMU to work with (as was the case on that embedded processor).  We <I>do</I> have a full MMU at our disposal.</P>
<P>So here's an even better idea that keeps every table read-only the entire time.  Put the function pointer tables in their own dedicated multiple-of-the-page sized section.  Let's call it <tt>.rodata.fxn_ptr</tt>.  The kernel maps its own <tt>.rodata.fxn_ptr</tt> read-only at some virtual address determined at runtime (ASLR). As modules get loaded, map their <tt>.rodata.fxn_ptr</tt> pages directly after the kernel's, also read-only.  The module ID now just becomes "how many pages to skip to get to the start of my module's table." That also removes the indirection.  When a module gets unloaded, unmap its table.</P>
<P>Now, you do have a new resource to manage.  But, if you force everyone into no more than, say, 8K, that still gives you 1024 entry points on a 64-bit machine.</P>

Yes, for a secure kernel.<br>
<p>
There are already config options in the kernel that you might have to change if you want to build out-of-tree modules, such as not pruning away unused symbols that no in-tree module uses. This would simply be another such option.<br>

      <I>the most an attacker can do, if they manage to overwrite the enum value, is to cause control to jump to a different one of the functions in the set.</I>
<P>
I'm afraid it takes only one exploit writer to develop a technique using only the available functions to defeat this mechanism...

I don't agree - or at least I don't agree that it implies the mechanism is worthless. Like many security measures it is not an impenetrable barrier but adds to defence in depth. It is a lot more awkward to arrange the stack so that a given kernel function will do what you want, than it is to jump to an unrestricted choice of kernel addresses. Many fewer 'gadgets' (as I understand the jargon) will be available.<br>

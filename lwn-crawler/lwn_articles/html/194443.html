<h1>The Grand Unified Flow Cache</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted August 7, 2006 by corbet]

               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The Grand Unified Flow Cache is one of those items which shows up as a
bullet in networking summit presentations; the networking folks appear to
know what it means, but they have been somewhat remiss in documenting the
idea for the rest of us.  This concept has returned in the context of the
network channels discussion, and enough hints have been dropped to let your
editor - who is not afraid to extrapolate a long way from minimal data -
get a sense for what the term means.  Should it be implemented, the GUFC
could bring significant changes to the entire networking stack.
<p>

The net channel concept requires that the kernel be able to quickly
identify the destination of each packet and drop it into the proper
channel.  Even better would be to have a smart network adapter perform that
classification as the packet arrives, taking the kernel out of that part of
the loop altogether.  One way of performing this classification would be to form a
tuple from each packet and use that tuple as a lookup key in some sort of
fast data structure.  When a packet's tuple is found in this structure (the
flow cache), its fate has been determined and it can be quickly shunted off
to where it needs to be.
<p>

This tuple, as <a href="/Articles/194461/">described</a> by Rusty Russell,
would be made up of seven parameters:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The source IP address
<li> The destination IP address
<li> A bit indicating whether the source is local
<li> A bit indicating whether the destination is local
<li> The IP protocol number
<li> The source port
<li> The destination port
</ul>
<p>
These numbers, all together, are sufficient to identify the connection to
which any packet belongs.  A quick lookup on an incoming packet should,
thus, yield a useful destination (such as a network channel) for that
packet with no further processing.
<p>

Features like netfilter mess up this pretty picture, however.  Within the
kernel, netfilter is set up such that every packet is fed to the
appropriate chain(s).  As soon as every packet has to go through a common
set of hooks, the advantage of the GUFC is lost.  Rusty's description of
the problem is this:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The mistake (?) with netfilter was that we are completely general:
	you will see all packets, do what you want.  If, instead, we had
	forced all rules to be of form "show me all packets matching this
	tuple" we would be in a [position to] combine it in a single lookup
	with routing etc.
</div>
<p>

So, the way around this problem would be to change the netfilter API to
work better with a grand unified flow cache.  Rules could be written
in terms of the above tuples (with wild cards allowed), and only packets
which match the tuples need pass through the (slow) netfilter path.  That
would allow packets which are not of interest to the filtering code to
bypass the whole mechanism - and the decision could be made in a single
lookup.
<p>

Often, however, a packet filtering decision can be made on the basis of the
tuple itself - once a packet matches the tuple, there is no real need to
evaluate it against the rule separately.  So, for example, once the
connection tracking code has allowed a new connection to be established,
and a tuple describing that connection has been added to the cache, further
filtering for that connection should not be required.  If netfilter and the
flow cache worked together effectively, the per-packet overhead could be
avoided in many cases.  
<p>

One way this might work would be to have a set of callbacks invoked for
each tuple which is added to the flow cache.  A module like netfilter could
examine the tuple relative to the current rule set and let the kernel know
if it needs to see packets matching that tuple or not.  Then, packets could
be directed to the appropriate filters without the need for wildcard
matching in the tuple cache.
<p>

There is a small cost to all of this:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Of course, it means rewriting all the userspace tools,
	documentation, and creating a complete new infrastructure for
	connection tracking and NAT, but if that's what's required, then so
	be it.
</div>
<p>
Rusty has never let this sort of obstacle stop him before, so all of this
might just happen.  
<p>
But probably not anytime soon.  There's a long list of questions which need
to be answered before a serious implementation attempt is made.  Whether
it would truly perform as well as people hope is one of them; these schemes
can get quite a bit slower once all of the real-world details are factored
in.  Rule updates could be a challenge; an administrator who has just
changed packet filtering rules is unlikely to wait patiently while the new
rules slowly work their way into the cache.  Finding a way to get the
hardware to help in the classification process will not be entirely
straightforward.  And so on.  But it would seem that there are a number of
interesting ideas in this area.  That is bound to lead to
good stuff sooner or later.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      From the sound of things, this could result in a set of filtering tools that (at least externally) <br>
would look a bit more like OpenBSD's pf.<br>
<p>
Since pf is about the only thing in OpenBSD which I think they did better than in Linux, this <br>
would be very welcome for my favorite OS kernel.<br>

      I think that in the case of rule changes, a flush of the cache would be needed when changes are done. I am guessing that depending on how the cache is setup.. one could do a partial flush versus a full one.<br>

      Have they found a way to workaround the 'swapped process' problem?<br>
<p>
I.e if you send a packet to a big process swapped to the disk, the ack could be sent quite a long time afterwards..<br>

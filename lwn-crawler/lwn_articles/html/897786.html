<p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/888715/">Readahead</a> is an I/O
optimization that causes the system to read more data than 
has been requested by an application—in the belief that the extra data will
be requested soon thereafter.  At the
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM), Matthew Wilcox
led a session to discuss readahead, especially as it relates to network
filesystems, with assistance from Steve French and
David Howells.  The latency of the underlying storage needs to factor into
the calculation of how much data to read in advance, but it is not entirely
clear how to do so.
</p>

<p>
Wilcox began by describing readahead a bit.  If user space is reading a
file one byte at a time, Linux does not actually read the data that way;
instead, it issues reads for a bigger chunk, say 64KB, which gets stored in
the page cache.  There is a certain amount of latency between the time a
page is requested from the storage and when it appears in the page cache;
that latency varies greatly over the wide variety of storage types that Linux
supports.  For network storage, those types can range from locally stored data on
multi-gigabit Ethernet to data stored halfway around the world over
decidedly slower links.  Similarly, for local storage it can range from a
5GB-per-second NVMe SSD to some "crappy USB key picked up from a vendor at
a trade show". There is "a lot of stuff to contend with there". 
</p>

</a>

<p>
In his experience, block-layer developers tend to do all of their testing
using direct I/O; they think that "the page cache sucks" so they avoid it
in their testing.  James Bottomley said they are often trying to exclude
the effects of the page cache from their testing in order to eliminate
variables outside of their control.  Wilcox said that it was 
unfortunate, since the performance including the page cache is "what the
users are actually seeing";  it would be nice to notice problems where
either too much or too little readahead is affecting the performance—before
users do.
</p>

<p>
He said that he has a <a
href="https://kernelnewbies.org/MatthewWilcox/ImprovedReadaheadAlgorithm">KernelNewbies
wiki page</a> where he is collecting his thoughts about readahead and the
page cache in general.  The page cache "is awesome in some
ways, in other ways it's terrible", but it would be good to fix the
problems that it has.
The Android developers encountered a problem with readahead, but
"they worked around it in the worst way possible".  They changed a setting
for readahead, moving it from 256KB to several hundred megabytes, he said,
in order to shave "some fraction of a second" from application startup
time.  That has other effects, of course; when they tried to upstream the
patches, the memory-management developers said "no".
</p>

<p>
Howells suggested that the Android developers should be using <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/posix_fadvise.2.html"><tt>fadvise()</tt></a>
(or, he amended, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>)
to indicate that the file should have more aggressive readahead.  But
Wilcox did not agree: "can we stop trying to pretend that user space knows
what it is doing?"   Android is a specialized environment, Bottomley said;
it uses a log-structured filesystem, so the workaround may actually make
sense.  Wilcox expressed some skepticism on that score.
</p>

<p>
Overall, there are a bunch of readahead problems to solve. "I'm going to
say the 'f' word; <a href="/Articles/893512/">folios</a> play into this a
bit."  The use of larger folios is driven by readahead, currently; the
larger the readahead data gets, the larger the folios to hold it get.  That
is useful for testing.  Filesystems that support larger folios, which is only
XFS for now (though AFS and v9fs patches are queued), will allocate
four-page (i.e. order-2)
folios.
</p>

<p>
Wilcox said that French made him aware that Windows does huge reads for
readahead on
CIFS.  French agreed with that, noting that because of the expected network
latency, Windows can readahead up to 16MB, though that seems to degrade
performance.  He tested with a number of different sizes (256KB, 512KB,
1MB, 4MB) and found better performance with each of those, the most
dramatic being seen when going to 512KB.  On the Azure cloud, the value was
set to 1MB because there were performance decreases for some workloads at 4MB.
</p>

<p>
The Linux CIFS server defaults to 4MB, he said, based on the results of his
testing.  It is clear that anything less than 1MB performs worse unless
there is a fast network in between.  The problem he sees is how this value
can get changed sanely, throttled or raised as appropriate.  Sometimes the
page cache knows more than the filesystem, or the reverse can be true, and
the network layer needs to factor in as well.  It is not clear to him how
that can all be resolved.
</p>

<p>
There is a mechanism to communicate this kind of information from the
filesystem to the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer and page cache using the
BDI (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.18.3/source/include/linux/backing-dev-defs.h#L172"><tt>struct&nbsp;backing_dev_info</tt></a>),
Wilcox said.  That is where the VFS looks to find out the performance
characteristics of the underlying storage.  It may not currently have all
of the right information, he said, but that's the place to put it.
</p>

<p>
When user space is reading a file one byte at a time, a 64KB read is issued
instead; a "was this readahead useful" marker is placed around 20KB into
the buffer and when it is 
reached, another 64KB read is issued.  The intent is that the second read
completes before user space consumes the rest of the 44KB, but the
filesystem has no idea of what the latency is for the read.  One could
imagine measuring how long it takes to do the read and comparing it with the user-space
consumption rate to better determine when to schedule the next read, he
said, but that is not done.
</p>

<p>
That second 64KB read has its marker placed right at the beginning of the
buffer; when that marker is reached, it decides to grow the readahead
buffer and reads 128KB.  It will increase once more (to 256KB), but not any
further, though it should probably go up from there.  The 256KB limit has been
that way for&nbsp;20 years and "I/O has hardly changed at all in that 
time", Wilcox said sarcastically; increasing that limit is many years overdue at this
point.  Josef Bacik read a chat comment from Jan Kara that said SUSE has
had a limit of 512KB for years. Given that, Wilcox thought an
immediate move to a 1MB maximum was in order.
</p>

<p>
But, rather than increasing the size of the read directly, Wilcox would rather
issue multiple 256KB reads back to back because that will help the page
cache track if the data that is read ahead is actually being used.  French
said that would be preferable for CIFS, as multiple smaller reads are
better performance-wise.  Jeff Layton came in via Zoom to say that
he thought a single, larger read would be better for NFS and was surprised
to hear that smaller reads were better for CIFS.
</p>

<p>
Howells said that which of the options is better is totally
filesystem-dependent.  Ted Ts'o said that it will also depend on the
underlying storage; increasing the readahead size on memory-constrained
devices may also be problematic.  There is not going to be a single "magic readahead formula"
that can be used in all situations.  He suggested making it possible to
experiment with different algorithms using BPF; that way a grad student,
for example, 
could easily try  out different ideas to see which worked best.  Wilcox
said that he had wanted to argue with that idea but then decided he liked
it because it would make it someone else's problem, which was met with much laughter.
</p>

<p>
Chuck Lever said that he thought the readahead situation was being greatly
oversimplified in 
the discussion.  In the original example of a program reading a byte at a
time, there is no reason to increase beyond 64KB, since that will keep up
with the program just fine.  There are problems with requesting too  much
data and filling the page cache with pages that are not actually going to
be read.
</p>

<p>
Another problem is that queueing up a 1MB read, for example, on a network
filesystem will
hold up other smaller requests, like metadata updates, while the read is
ongoing.  He agrees with the need for experimentation and thinks that
should take precedence over any immediate increase in the kernel's
readahead size.  There is a need for testing with a lot of different
workloads, filesystems, and so forth to determine what the overall systemic
effects of that kind of change would be.

There was a trick built into the Java &quot;runtime&quot; in Google; essentially, the script that started the JVM was prefixed by `cat $JARFILE &gt; /dev/null` . This sped up start-up times immensely, because it assured that the entire jar file was in the block cache before the Java process started to load classes from it, which was often in terrible order (partially because JAR files are PKZIP, with their &quot;header&quot; at the end of the file). This is likely where the Android example of insane readahead &quot;got it&quot;.<br>

ld.so would normally just mmap the file and then read the parts it wants (and skipping debuginfo in that sense). I don&#x27;t see any madvise call in glibc to that end, so if there is any gratuitous readahead, it&#x27;s being done by the kernel, which makes it &quot;someone else&#x27;s problem&quot; as far as glibc is concerned ;-)<br>

Some Linux distros use split debuginfo, whereby those sections are objcopy&#x27;d into files separate files in /usr/lib/debug and then stripped off the original executable. This makes it possible to install both pieces separately depending on what&#x27;s needed. It so conveniently happens to also stop excess (file descriptor based) readahead, though that surely was not the motivation.<br>

It sounds like some people are about to try to reinvent TCP&#x27;s last few decades of bandwidth-delay-product optimizations for packet-switching networks with highly variable and unknown performance characteristics.<br>
<p>
To be fair, the state of the art in networking probably doesn&#x27;t apply directly to a filesystem + block device stack, so someone will have to do some adaptation; however, it&#x27;s not like a lot of people haven&#x27;t been studying a very similar problem domain for a very long time.<br>

I am Very Much Not looking to invent my own algorithm. I&#x27;m quite aware that we&#x27;re often in a Long Fat Pipe situation with storage (particularly multi-spindle devices). Our existing readahead algorithm is shoddy, and its heuristics are laughable.<br>
<p>
One purpose of this session was to gather feedback from filesystem people about their requirements... which turned out to be contradictory.<br>
<p>
I think I have a pretty good handle on the performance characteristics of block storage (from floppies to CD-ROMs to laptop HDs to RAID arrays to USB sticks to SSDs), but I&#x27;m pretty clueless about the performance characteristics of network servers, so that was where I was looking to learn.<br>

If userspace issues a request for 1 byte, is the latency substantially higher for them to get the result if we issue 1x 1MB read rather than 4x 256KB ones?<br>
Or are we smart enough to return immediately on any partial read completing?<br>

Depends on the file system and storage details of course but in general as soon as the needed page is in cache the read will return.  The question is how did we get it there, so how much faster did the first page arrive than the very last… etc <br>

Oh and also: to what extent the reading occurs in another thread, duh.  Networked file systems often have daemons, local ones probably don’t, so they’ll just finish it all before returning.<br>

Alas, not as true as you&#x27;d like it to be. The read will return as soon as the relevant page in the cache is marked Uptodate and unlocked. Typically that happens at the end of the I/O in the bio completion routine (... or the networking equivalent). So while the data arrives earlier (probably -- some transports can send data out of order), we&#x27;re only notified when the entire I/O completes.<br>
<p>
It&#x27;s a standard latency vs bandwidth tradeoff. If we were notified for each page, we&#x27;d spend much more CPU processing completions, but reads would complete faster. We&#x27;ve chosen a model that readahead should always be in advance of the application, so we don&#x27;t need to spend the extra CPU to track at that granularity.<br>

Is there a way to restrict it to two notifications only, one for the range requested and one for the whole thing? I&#x27;m guessing no but I&#x27;m not well versed on this so I&#x27;d rather ask.<br>

Sure! We could submit two bio&#x27;s, one for the range that&#x27;s needed right now, and one for the range that&#x27;s speculatively needed.<br>
<p>
But generally all of the range is brought in speculatively, so this probably won&#x27;t help many workloads. If you try to implement this, I&#x27;d love to see the results.<br>

How does this impact fairness calculations?  On a heavily loaded system, where there is contention for filesystem reads (either because of bandwidth, or seek time), suppose a process is parsimoniously reading just the first hundred bytes of a file.   But the kernel&#x27;s readahead slurps the whole first megabyte.  Will the I/O scheduler penalize that process for the whole I/O performed, or does the accounting work only on what was requested?<br>

It really feels like what is actually needed is to separate readahead into two separate concepts. One that exposes performance characteristics based on fixed parameters such as FS type, device type, and link type, and then another optimizer that can look at those parameters, get a feel for what kind of insane things the user is doing, and start making smarter choices based on that. That way the system can behave differently when the user is doing one big read off of a well designed local filesystem and small reads off a remote and slow filesystem.<br>

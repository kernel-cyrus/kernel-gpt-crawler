<p>
Digging into the email that provides the cornerstone of Linux kernel
development is an endeavor that has become more popular over the last few
years.  There are some practical reasons for analyzing the
kernel mailing lists and for correlating that information with the patches
that actually reach the mainline, including tracking the path that
patches take—or don't take.  Three researchers reported on some efforts
they have made on kernel email analysis at the <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference-europe-2019/">2019
Embedded Linux Conference Europe</a> (ELCE), held in late October in Lyon, France.
</p>

<p>
The presentation (<a
href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/osseu19/5c/pasta-elce19.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a>) actually listed four speakers, though one could not make it to
ELCE.  The three present were Ralf Ramsauer,  from the Technical University of
Applied Sciences Regensburg, Sebastian Duda, of
Friedrich–Alexander University Erlangen–Nürnberg, and Wolfgang Mauerer,  
of Siemens AG in Munich.  Lukas Bulwahn, who is a hobbyist active in the Linux
Foundation <a href="https://elisa.tech/">ELISA Project</a> and employed at
BMW AG, was unable to attend.  In the introduction, Mauerer jokingly suggested that
the goal of the research was to understand more "than the NSA already
knows" about the behavior of
kernel developers.  Really, though, the presentation was meant partly as a request for
comments; the researchers have been observing the kernel community for some
time and have been pulling out pieces they find interesting, but they would
be happy to hear other ideas on the kinds of analysis that would be useful
to the community.
</p>

<h4>Development process</h4>

<a href="/Articles/804678/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/elce-mauerer-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="left"

</a>

<p>
Ramsauer said that the goal of the research is "formalizing and assessing
the Linux kernel development process".  There are a number of motivations
for doing so, both from inside and outside the community; his personal
motivation is to write more papers to finish his PhD work, he said with a
grin.  There is interest from the safety-critical development world,
automotive and industrial equipment makers, for example.  The
safety-certification bodies require documented development practices; since
the 
development process of Linux is not something under the control of the equipment
makers, the best they can do is to document the existing practice to those
bodies.  Beyond that, the techniques they are working on can be used to
monitor the health of 
Linux and other projects, as is done by the <a
href="https://chaoss.community/">CHAOSS project</a>.
</p>

<p>
Tracing the development process has come up recently in the kernel
community as well.  The interest in tracking patches through various
stages in their development was the underlying motivation for the proposal
to <a href="/Articles/797613/">add change IDs to patches</a>.  There were
alternatives proposed, such as adding the Message-ID of the previous patch
posting to an update, but that is not consistently done throughout the
kernel.  The community would like to find a solution to this problem that
avoids the, perhaps only minor, inconvenience of maintaining those IDs.
</p>

<p>
The problem stems from the disconnect between activity on the mailing list
and commits in the Git repositories.  He went through the typical lifecycle
of a patch set, starting with its development, which is done in private
typically on some Git branch.  Eventually the patch set surfaces on one or
more kernel mailing lists, where it is reviewed.  The review comments are
reflected in the patches and they are posted again.  That process is
followed, iteratively, until the patches are acceptable and merged (or not).
</p>

<a href="/Articles/804680/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/elce-ramsauer-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Ralf Ramsauer]" title="Ralf Ramsauer" width=214 height=280>
</a>

<p>
Each posting of the patch set, along with all of the comments and
discussion associated with it, can be identified by the Message-ID in the
posting, which is new for each iteration.  But the commit (or commits) that
stem from the patch set are 
identified with a Git commit hash.  There is potentially a many-to-many
relationship between these message IDs and commit hashes, which leads to a need
for a tool to extract that information from the mailing lists and Git repositories.
</p>

<p>
They have a tool, <a href="https://github.com/lfd/PaStA">Patch Stack
Analysis</a> (PaStA), that can do that work.  It originally was written to
detect <i>similar</i> patches between different branches in order to quantify
the upstreaming efforts of various out-of-tree projects (e.g. vendor
kernels, realtime patches).  It has now been extended to work with mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
He gave an example of two patches to show how they are processed to
determine how similar they are.  The patches are tokenized and then string
distance measurements are used to generate  a similarity score.  If that
score exceeds a threshold, the patches are considered likely to be related
and a similarity graph is created, which gets matched up with patches in
the repository.  More information about the techniques used can be found in
two papers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03147.pdf">PDF&nbsp;1</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00905.pdf">PDF&nbsp;2</a>) they have
written, Ramsauer said.
</p>

<p>
The Git data to be used is easy to come by simply by cloning the
repository of interest, but the mailing list data is not as easy.  Up until a few
years ago, they used the data from Gmane, but that has become
unreliable after the <a href="/Articles/695695/">demise of Gmane</a>
(mostly) in 2016.  <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lists.html">Lore.kernel.org</a> is a
reasonable substitute, with some data going back to 1996 and beyond, but it has
a limited subset of mailing lists.  It also has imported some of its data
from Gmane, which improperly handled some headers, so it can be difficult
to work with.
</p>

<p>
Due to that, they started collecting their own <a
href="https://github.com/linux-mailinglist-archives">archive of around 200 kernel
mailing lists</a> in May.  In doing so, they ran into the same problems that anyone
dealing with a large pile of email encounters: email is full of all sorts
of weirdness.  There are broken encodings, bad dates, badly formatted
Message-ID headers, and more.  Once that all gets cleaned up, that data
will be ready to use, he said.
</p>

<h4>Some results</h4>

<p>
Duda then stepped up to the podium to report on what had been found in
their analysis.  They looked at the roughly 610,000 commits to the mainline
starting with the v2.6.39 tag along with around three-million emails from
the public lists on lore.kernel.org; 34 mailing lists were used, starting in May
2011 and running until the end of 
2018.   Of the three-million emails, though, not all are patches;
eliminating the non-patches left 1.15m patches.  But not all patches posted
to the lists are actually patches to the kernel; beyond that, there is a
fair amount of traffic that comes from bots, pull requests, stable reviews,
and the like.  In the end, they winnowed it all down to around 800,000 emails
with patches from humans that were meant to be applied to the current
kernel at the time they were posted.  That is what they ran through the
analysis program.
</p>

</a>

<p>
They set out to see if they could identify unmaintained subsystems based on
patches that get ignored on the mailing lists.  As it turns out, they were
not able to do so because the two do not correlate.  In the process,
though, they found other interesting things.  First they defined an ignored
patch as one where the posting thread has no responses other than by the
author, where the patch itself does not get accepted upstream, and that any
related (similar) patches for, say, other kernel versions were also ignored.
</p>

<p>
Based on that criteria, 2.5% of patches were ignored over the time period.
Interestingly, the percentages seemed to drop over time: 2011 had 3.9%,
2015 had 2.1%, and 2018 had 1.6%.  When graphing that, which can be seen in
slide 18 or around 17:50 in the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCfU-2dXDq0">YouTube video</a> of the
talk, a large spike appears in the ignored patch line midway through 2016.
That comes from a single 1300-patch posting that, perhaps unsurprisingly, got
ignored.  Since it throws off the rest of the graphs, they simply
eliminated that outlier in subsequent graphs.
</p>

<p>
What the corrected graph shows is that there are roughly 30-50 patches that are
ignored each week throughout the time frame.  But the number of patches
submitted each week rose over that same time frame, which leads to the
percentage decline.  At a talk given at the <a
href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>
(LPC), some maintainers asked for a way to find out how many patches they
were ignoring.  To 
try to help answer that question, Duda said that they have also run the tool on
individual mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
He presented four graphs of the linux-arm-kernel, linux-mips,
linux-wireless, and netdev mailing lists.  One thing that stands out right
away is that all show a steady number of ignored patches.  That number is
quite low in all four, ten or less per week, and it remains flat even when
the overall number of patches posted to the mailing list grows.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting that over the time period, the number of patches to
linux-kernel-arm went from around 150 per week to as many as 700 per week,
but that 
the ignored patches remained below ten per week, 
Ramsauer said.  That trend persists with most mailing lists, though there a
few that look different, he said.  They chose the linux-kernel-arm and
linux-kernel-mips lists 
because both are architectures, but the Arm list has grown substantially
over the years, while MIPS has stayed roughly the same.  Likewise for
linux-wireless and netdev, though linux-wireless has actually declined slightly over
the years.
</p>

<p>
Another analysis that they did, Ramsauer said, is to try to see if the
likelihood of being ignored is correlated to when in development cycle it
is sent.   As it turns out, being ignored is largely independent of when in
the cycle a patch is sent.  There is, however, a slightly higher chance of
a patch being ignored during the merge window.
</p>

<h4>Off-list patches</h4>

<p>
During this work, they also discovered some "off-list" patches, which have
been included into Linus Torvalds's Git tree, but were not posted to a
public mailing list prior to that.  They analyzed the stabilization phase
of the 5.1 kernel, patches from v5.1-rc1 to v5.1, which was around 1800
commits.  They mapped those commits back to the mailing list and found 60
that did not have a mailing-list thread identified.  Some of those were
errors in their tool, but a manual review showed that 24 patches were
off-list patches.
</p>

<p>
Some of those were reverts, where doing the revert <i>was</i> discussed on
the list, but the actual patch doing the revert was not posted.  Some were
also simply fixups of various sorts by the maintainers that were never
discussed.  There are some subsystems where the maintainers often have
off-list patches, he said.  In addition, of course, some of those patches will be
security fixes that were discussed, but not publicly.  For example, he
pointed to a <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?h=v5.4-rc7&id=c7084edc3f6d67750f50d4183134c4fb5712a5c8">commit</a>
from Greg Kroah-Hartman that never appeared on a public list; when asked,
Kroah-Hartman said that it had been discussed on the closed kernel security
mailing list.  Thus this kind of analysis might  provide a way to find
security fixes before they become publicly known, Ramsauer said.
</p>

<p>
Several audience members were interested to know which subsystems tended to
have off-list patches, but the researchers did not want to point fingers.
It is entirely possible for others to do the same analysis, however, as an
attendee pointed out, which could lead to a lucrative, if possibly illegal,
"business" of  disclosing them in various ways.  The clear takeaway is that
off-list patches are likely to become more visible, rather than quietly
lurking in the sea of other patches, before too long. 
</p>

<p>
As Mauerer noted at the end of the talk, this kind of research is not well
funded, either by industry or by normal academic research channels.
Presenting results at a conference like ELCE is not deemed important in
academic circles, while presenting it in a workshop to half-a-dozen people
who have never submitted a single kernel patch is
seen as valuable in that realm.  He encouraged companies and other
organizations to consider funding this kind of research in the future.

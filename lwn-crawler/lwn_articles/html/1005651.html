As of this writing, just over 4,300 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline repository for the 6.14 release.  Many of the pull
requests this time around include remarks saying that activity has been
relatively low this time around, presumably due to the holidays.  So those
4,300 changesets are probably closer to the merge-window halfway point than
usual.  Much of the work merged thus far looks more like incremental
improvements than major new initiatives, but there still have been a number
of interesting changes in the mix.
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->
Some of the most significant changes pulled into the mainline so far are:
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The PowerPC architecture has gained <a href="/Articles/994322/">lazy
     preemption</a> support.
<li> X86 systems using AMD's <a
     href="https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html">Secure Encrypted
     Virtualization</a> feature now support a secure timestamp counter for
     guests.  In short, it allows guests to read timestamps that cannot be
     manipulated by the host.
<li> AMD's energy-use counters for CPU cores are now supported in the
     perf events subsystem.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <tt>pid_max</tt> sysctl knob sets the highest number that can be
     used for a process ID; it has the effects of limiting the size of PID
     values and of limiting the total number of processes that may exist.
     In 6.14, <tt>pid_max</tt> is now tied to the PID namespace, allowing
     it to be set independently within containers.  It is hierarchical,
     so no namespace can set <tt>pid_max</tt> to a value higher than
     that found in any of its parent namespaces.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7863dcc72d0f">this commit</a> for
     more information about this change.
<li> When a program is launched with <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execveat.2.html"><tt>execveat()</tt></a>,
     the name of the executed file as stored in its directory entry will be
     shown in <tt>/proc</tt> rather than (as is done in current kernels)
     the file-descriptor number that was used.  See <a
     href="/Articles/999770/">this article</a> for details on this change.
<li> The new "dmem" control-group controller regulates access to device
     memory, such as that found on graphics cards.  Documentation is
     sparse, but there is <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#dmem">a
     brief guide</a> to the configuration of this controller available.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The pidfdfs filesystem can now create file handles (when requested by
     a <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open_by_handle_at.2.html"><tt>name_to_handle_at()</tt></a>
     call); these can be used to create a system-wide unique identifier for
     processes even on 32-bit systems.  It is also now possible to
     bind-mount pidfds.
<li> The <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html"><tt>statx()</tt></a>
     system call can now return the required alignment for read operations
     on a file; that alignment may be different than the requirement for
     writes, and some applications can benefit from knowing both.
<li> Some Btrfs configurations give the filesystem a choice of multiple
     devices when the time comes to read a specific block.  In current
     kernels, the PID of the reading process is used to make that decision,
     but that will focus all read traffic onto a single device in a
     single-reader workload.  The 6.14 kernel adds a couple of new policy
     options that can implement either round-robin read balancing or simply
     focus reads onto a specific device.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6d7a9154955e">this commit</a> for
     instructions on enabling round-robin, or <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c86aae73bd58">this one</a> to set a
     specific device.
<li> The bcachefs filesystem has a lot of changes after missing the 6.13
     development cycle; these include a major on-disk format change that
     will require a "<q>big and expensive</q>" format upgrade.  These
     changes include self-healing improvements, filesystem-checking time
     "<q>improved by multiple orders of magnitude</q>", and more; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2622f2904170">this merge
     message</a> for more information.
<li> The md-linear device-mapper target (which essentially concatenates
     block devices) was removed in 6.8 as being deprecated and
     unmaintained.  It seems that there were still users of this target,
     though, so it <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/127186cfb184">has
     been restored</a> for 6.14.  This change is also marked for the stable
     updates, so should propagate to the older kernels as well.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>Clock</b>:
     Qualcomm X1P42100 graphics clock controllers,
     Qualcomm QCS615 and SM8750 global clock controllers,
     Qualcomm SM8750 TCSR clock controllers,
     Qualcomm SM8750 display clock controllers,
     Qualcomm IPQ CMN PLL clock controllers, and
     Qualcomm SM6115 low power audio subsystem clock controllers.
<li> <b>Graphics</b>:
     Synopsys Designware MIPI DSI host DRM bridges and
     ZynqMP DisplayPort audio interfaces.
<li> <b>Hardware monitoring</b>:
     TI TPS25990 monitoring interfaces,
     Intel common redundant power supply monitors, and
     Analog Devices ADM1273 hot-swap controllers.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     NVMe PCI endpoint function targets,
     Loongson memory controllers,
     AMD AI engines,
     STMicroelectronics LED1202 I2C LED controllers,
     TI LP8864/LP8866 4/6 channel LED drivers,
     KEBA SPI interfaces, and
     Airoha EN7581 SoC CPU-frequency controllers.
<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     NXP S32G/S32R Ethernet interfaces,
     Realtek 8922AE-VS PCI wireless network adapters, and
     QNAP microcontroller unit cores.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <tt>samples</tt> directory in the kernel repository contains a new
     program, <tt>mountinfo</tt>, which demonstrates the use of the <a
     href="/Articles/950569/"><tt>statmount()</tt> and
     <tt>listmount()</tt></a> system calls.
<li> When Rust 1.84.0 (or later) is available, Rust code in the kernel will
     use the <a
     href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/123430"><tt>derive(CoercePointee)</tt></a>
     feature for pointer coercion.  That feature is on the Rust-language
     stabilization track, and its use is an important step toward using only
     stable Rust features in the kernel.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e3610441d1fb">This merge
     message</a> shows how it can be used.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/networking/rxrpc.html">RxRPC</a>
     protocol implementation can now make use of huge UDP frames for better
     throughput.  Support for the <a
     href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8985">RACK-TLP</a>
     loss-detection algorithm has also been added.
<li> There is a new per-network-namespace sysctl knob —
     <tt>tcp_tw_reuse_delay</tt> — that controls how long the system will
     wait before reusing the port number of a closed TCP socket; its value
     is in milliseconds.
<li> It is now possible to select whether an interface MAC or PHY should be
     used as the provider of PTP timestamps; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/bc6a5efe3dcd">this merge
     message</a> gives some examples of how to do this that are presumably
     intelligible to people familiar with such things.
<li> IPsec IP-TFS/AGGFRAG (<a
     href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9347/">RFC 9347</a>) is now
     supported.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The "xperms" SELinux feature allows policies to target specific
     <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls or netlink messages.  In-kernel documentation
     is missing, but <a
     href="https://selinuxproject.org/page/XpermRules">this wiki page</a>
     has some information.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The kernel's annotation system, used to add information about code
     (such as "this jump is safe without a retpoline") would previously
     create a different ELF section for each annotation type.  There is now
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2116b349e29a">a generic
     annotation infrastructure</a> that gathers all of that information
     into a single section.

</ul>
<p>
The 6.14 merge window can be expected to remain open through
February&nbsp;2, with the 6.14 release most likely happening on
March&nbsp;23.  This timing seems more certain than usual, just because it
will maximize editorial pain at LWN due to the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> starting on
March&nbsp;24.  One way or another, we'll survive the experience and tell

Feels like this one deserved to be mentioned as well, as it opens the door for closing a major gap between Linux and other OSes like Windows:<br>
<p>
Author: Mickaël Salaün &lt;mic@digikod.net&gt;<br>
    exec: Add a new AT_EXECVE_CHECK flag to execveat(2)<br>
    <br>
    Add a new AT_EXECVE_CHECK flag to execveat(2) to check if a file would<br>
    be allowed for execution.  The main use case is for script interpreters<br>
    and dynamic linkers to check execution permission according to the<br>
    kernel's security policy. Another use case is to add context to access<br>
    logs e.g., which script (instead of interpreter) accessed a file.<br>
<p>
<p>
Combined with IPE, dm-verity and an englightened interpreter, this will allow code integrity checks for scripts too!<br>

I feel like I remember reading more about this flag, but I can't find an LWN article. If I'm reading the man page for execveat(2) correctly, this takes in a directory file descriptor and a pathname. Can this lead to TOCTOU bugs if the underlying file is modified between the AT_EXECVE_CHECK call and the actual script execution? I'd imagine it would be safer to do this via a file descriptor, no?<br>

The bcachefs is filesystem like btrfs or ZFS. Is this true that will be removed from kernel?<br>

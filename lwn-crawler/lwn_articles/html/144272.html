coverage</a>.

A separate summit for Linux networking hackers was held in Montreal
immediately prior to the Kernel Summit; sixteen developers were in
attendance.  Jamal Hadi Salim briefly presented 
the results from the discussion there.  The theme of the meeting was
taken from a comment by Alexey Kuznetsov found in
<tt>net/ipv4/tcp_input.c</tt>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
<tt>/* Old crap is replaced with new one. 8)</tt>
</div>
<p>
It seems that much old crap is being replaced in the networking subsystem.
Briefly: 
<p>
<ul>

<li> Changes are in store in the IPSec/XFRM area; the current 
     configuration interface is considered to be too inflexible and
     unfriendly.  A proposal for a replacement is circulating.
<p>
<li> Thomas Graf is reworking the networking configuration options.  He
     also has a new netlink library and a netconfig tool in the prototype
     stage.
<p>
<li> David Miller continues to work on his "super TSO" code - trying to
     improve the performance of TCP segmentation offload in real-world
     situations. 
<p>
<li> The venerable socket buffer ("SKB") structure has come under fire for
     being too bloated; an SKB now can occupy 256 bytes on 64-bit systems.
     This structure will begin to shrink in 2.6.14, with a target size of
     192 or even 128 bytes.
<p>
<li> Herbert Xu is working on the crypto-API interface, with the goal of
     adding asynchronous support.  The existing synchronous interface will
     be maintained, as will, hopefully, performance.  Also added will be
     support for multiple implementations of the same algorithm; it was not
     immediately clear why.  The first user of the new code will be IPSec.
<p>
<li> Stephen Hemminger is working on a number of projects.  One is the <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/128681/">pluggable TCP congestion
     avoidance modules</a> patch, which has been merged into the mainline.
     Improving port number randomization for TCP is another project.  There
     is a project to reduce the size of the networking stack for embedded
     systems.  The <tt>CONFIG_EMBEDDED</tt> flag will be used to this
     effect, though that approach is not popular with all developers (who
     see that flag as being somewhat overloaded).
     <p>
     Another item on the list is remote DMA (RDMA).  Several issues must be
     resolved for RDMA support in Linux (see <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/133649/">this Kernel Page article</a>),
     and there is little consensus that RDMA should be supported at all.
     In the end, though, RDMA exists, some people will want to use it, so
     Linux will probably support it in some way.  The developers are
     currently waiting for code.
     <p>
     It appears that a similar attitude is slowly developing toward TCP
     offload engines - something which the Linux developers have always
     refused to support.  TOE is not going away, and some sort of support
     might yet be merged.
<p>
<li> Mention was made (in other contexts as well) of the "ostra" tool being
     developed by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo.  Ostra is a debugging tool
     based on "sparse"; it is being used with the networking code.  Arnaldo
     has not yet reached a point of releasing this code, however.
<p>
<li> Linux is now IPv6 ready!  We're sure you are glad to know that.  IPv6
     work continues, however; among other things, current development is
     focusing on mobile IPv6, policy routing, and various types of
     tunneling functionality.
<p>
<li> James Morris is working on the integration of SELinux and networking.
     Integration with the netfilter code is at the top of the list, with
     IPSec not too far behind.  Once that's done, there are cluster
     filesystems to worry about.  There are plans to use the "trusted
     platform module" chip for secure networking in the future.
</ul>
<p>

David Miller concluded with a "state of the networking union" address.  The
summary is simple: "we are in good shape, we kick ass, more good stuff is
coming."<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<a href="/Articles/619514/">Compound pages</a> are created by the kernel as
a way of combining a number of small pages into a single, larger unit.
Such pages are implemented as a single "head page" at the beginning,
followed by a number of "tail pages".  Matthew Wilcox has concluded that
it would be beneficial to minimize the use of tail pages in the kernel; he
ran a session during the memory-management track at the 2019 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit to explore how that could be done.
The discussion ranged widely, veering into the representation of DMA I/O
operations, but few hard conclusions were reached.
<p>
The most common use for compound pages is to represent huge pages, as
created by the transparent huge pages or hugetlbfs features.  The slab
allocators can also create compound pages to satisfy larger allocations.
Since compound pages can be thought of as simply being larger pages, they can
usually be managed using just the head page.  There are times, though, when
the tail pages come into play.  Most often, something (a page fault,
perhaps) will create a reference within a larger page; the tail page is
then used to locate the head page, which is where most of the relevant
information is stored.
<p>
To make things as transparent as possible, many places in the kernel use
the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0.11/source/include/linux/page-flags.h#L140"><tt>compound_head()</tt></a>
function to ensure that they are looking at a head page, even when the page

<a href="/Articles/787414/"><img

title="Matthew Wilcox" class="lthumb"></a>


in question may not be a compound page.  That is overhead that, perhaps, does
not need to be incurred.  There is a <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> memory barrier in
it, Wilcox pointed out; even if the overhead is small, it will be greater
than zero and nice to get rid of.
<p>
There are a number of kernel functions that can yield a reference to a tail
page, including <tt>virt_to_page()</tt>, <tt>phys_to_page()</tt>, and
<tt>find_get_entry()</tt>.  If those functions were to, instead, give a
pointer to the head page, the calls to <tt>compound_head()</tt> could be
eliminated.  In the case of <tt>virt_to_page()</tt>, one can simply call
<tt>virt_to_head_page()</tt> instead when one knows that the result could
otherwise be a tail page — problem solved.  There is no
<tt>phys_to_head_page()</tt>, but perhaps that should be added.
<p>
A trickier problem is the page cache; if a transparent huge page is stored
there, all of the tail pages are stored along with the head page.  Wilcox
has a patch to store only the head page, making things far more efficient
in general, but there are a lot of related functions that can return tail
pages; these include <tt>find_get_page()</tt>,
<tt>find_get_pages_range()</tt>, and others.  There is thus a need for
replacements that only return head pages, followed by the usual effort to
track down and fix all of the callers.
<p>
Even trickier is the problem of dealing with page tables; this is what
Wilcox described as the "controversial bit".  He would like to introduce a
replacement for <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> called
<tt>get_user_head_pages()</tt>; it would only return the head pages for the
region of memory mapped into the kernel.  Callers would  not be able to
make assumptions about the size of the pages, and would have to be more
careful in how they work with those pages.  This function would, as a result, be
harder to use than the function it replaces (which is already not entirely
easy), it is more complex, and there are a lot of callers to fix.  He is
not sure when or even if such a transition would ever be completed.
Additionally, as Kirill Shutemov pointed out, callers may really want the
tail page sometimes, so it may not be possible to make this change at all.
<p>
A second option is thus worth considering.  Wilcox asserted that most
callers of <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> have, as their real goal, the creation
of a scatter/gather list for DMA I/O operations — an assertion that
Christoph Hellwig immediately disputed.  Presenting a list of files
containing <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> calls, Wilcox asked an attendee to
pick one at random; digging into that file, he showed that the results of
the call were, indeed, used to create a scatter/gather list.  Hellwig then
went into a characteristic exposition on why the current
<tt>struct scatterlist</tt> data structure is the wrong solution to the problem,
since it mixes DMA information with the host representation of the memory
and creates confusion when memory areas are coalesced on the DMA side.
<p>
A replacement for the current scatter/gather list representation may be on
the horizon, but that is somewhat orthogonal to the idea that Wilcox was
getting at here.  Rather than having kernel code call
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt> and using the result to create a scatter/gather
list, it might be better to implement a <tt>get_user_sg()</tt> function
that would do the full job.  That function could then hide any dealings
with tail pages while simultaneously simplifying callers.
<p>
If <tt>struct scatterlist</tt> is to be eliminated, <tt>get_user_sg()</tt>
could still be implemented in some form.  The leading contender for a
replacement structure appears to be <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0.11/source/include/linux/bvec.h#L27"><tt>struct
biovec</tt></a>.  This structure has its origins in the block layer, but is
widely used in the rest of the kernel at this point; the networking code
was described as 
the biggest remaining holdout.  A <tt>biovec</tt> can describe the host
side of an I/O operation; the device side would need a different structure
that, perhaps, is more specific to the hardware involved.
<p>
In any case, almost everything discussed in this session is theoretical
until patches appear on the mailing lists.  Until then, the kernel will
continue to deal with tail pages (and scatter/gather lists) the way it
has for years.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks for the write-up, Jon!<br>
<p>
I dispute the "few hard conclusions" part.<br>
<p>
As far as the get_user_pages problem goes, we'd been having various discussions on the mailing lists about a path forward without anything clearly emerging, and now at least I am firmly behind Christoph's plan.<br>
<p>
After the session, I grabbed Dave Miller and solicited his opinion on converting the network layer to use biovecs. He wanted to see what it looked like, and it looks like this ...<br>

<p>
For the page cache use of tail pages, there was at least no disagreement that the way forward is to return the head pages only. I think it's just up to me to do the work 😉<br>

Small correction: READ_ONCE() is not a memory barrier.  It merely tells the compiler to avoid applying any optimizations to the read (by typecasting the read's target address to volatile *).  It may have some overhead, but that overhead is quite small compared to a genuine memory barrier.<br>

Traditional rant: READ_ONCE and WRITE_ONCE are super-confusing names. It should be really called VOLATILE(). Re-using terms known to C developers would make the code more understandable.<br>

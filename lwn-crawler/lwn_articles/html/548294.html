<h1>LSFMM: Storage data integrity</h1>

<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">LSFMM Summit 2013</a>
</div>
<p>
In a combined Storage and Filesystem track session at the 2013 LSFMM
Summit, 
Darrick Wong kicked off a discussion of storage data integrity protection. He
gave a talk at the 2011 Linux Plumbers Conference on the same topic, so he
wanted to update the assembled 
developers on what had changed.  There are standards for attaching 
metadata to data that is being written to or read from storage devices that
can be used to check the data's integrity.  The SCSI data integrity field
(DIF) can hold a CRC to detect data corruption as well as 32-bit block
numbers that can catch misplaced writes.
</p>

<p>
There are applications that want to use DIF, but there is currently no
user-space interface to do so.  One way to get there might be
using space in the kernel
asynchronous I/O (KAIO) interface to add a pointer to "something else" that
holds the protection information.  Another option is to "pull a Windows
trick" and have length and version information so that the kernel knows
which version of the API is being used, thus how
much data to copy from user space, Wong said.
</p>

<p>
Another idea that comes up repeatedly is to use Joel Becker's batched I/O
interface, called sys_dio, Wong said.  That interface, which provides a way
to attach integrity information to I/O operations, was originally
something Becker did 
that was 
customized for Oracle's use case. Becker would like to make it more
generic.  It is a nicer interface that is "purely asynchronous" for direct 
I/O (i.e. <tt>O_DIRECT</tt>); Becker put out an <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems/51015">RFC for sys_dio</a> two years ago.
It was used by Martin Petersen to pass the protection information in and
out of the kernel, but neither he nor Petersen has yet had time to work on
finishing it up.

<p>
With his "database hat on", Petersen said that both solutions (KAIO and
sys_dio) would be useful.  He went on to describe how applications use the
protection information to widen the window over which the data is
protected.  The application can query the block layer to find out what
kind of CRC to generate.  Those applications (typically database systems
like Oracle and MySQL) already have a block-oriented view, so they
calculate the proper CRC to send with the data.  If it arrives and doesn't
pass the CRC test, the application may still be able to recreate it, which
is why it is interested in integrity handling.  The
kernel can do the calculation for other applications, Petersen said.
</p>

<p>
The SCSI T10 DIF is only concerned with protection on
the path between the host adapter (HBA) and the storage device, but
Petersen authored the <a
href="https://oss.oracle.com/~mkp/docs/dix-draft.pdf">data integrity
extensions (DIX) [PDF]</a> to add end-to-end data integrity by including
the operating system and applications.  He is looking into making DIX look "less
blocky" on the host, so that it could calculate a CRC on a list of
scatter/gather I/O operations,
then pass it to
the HBA, which could then write it in the proper block format.
</p>

<p>
But Becker was not convinced that applications need to be shielded from
dealing with blocks directly.  Any application that cares about end-to-end
integrity will also care about the blocks on disk.  Petersen would like
sys_dio to not preclude byte-oriented uses, though.  Wong said
that it is easier to use KAIO for that case, however.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the storage and filesystem developers agreed to look carefully
at what Wong plans to post to the lists over the coming months, with an eye
toward 
resolving these issues.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Just a clarification wrt. userspace interface availability. Oracle ships a driver called oracleasm that is essentially a very low overhead asynchronous direct I/O interface. oracleasm is the preferred I/O submission interface for the Oracle Database running on the Linux platform. And this interface already supports data integrity passthrough. So if you run the Oracle Database with ASM on DIX/DIF-capable hardware we fully support end-to-end data integrity protection today. I.e. checksums are generated/verified in userland by the RDBMS.<br>
<p>
sys_dio was drafted based on the experiences Joel and I gathered developing oracleasm. sys_dio is an attempt to make the interface generic and not tied to the Database or ASM.<br>

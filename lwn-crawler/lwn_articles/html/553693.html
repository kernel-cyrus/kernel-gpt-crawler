<h1>Outreach program for women—kernel edition</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 12, 2013</br>

<p>
While three kernel internships for women were <a
href="https://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/167-amanda-mcpherson/716409-announcing-outreach-program-for-women-internships-for-the-linux-kernel-please-apply/">originally
announced</a> in late April, the size of the program has more than doubled
since then.  Seven internships have been established for kernel work
through the <a
href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">Outreach Program for
Women</a> (OPW); each comes with a $5000 stipend and a $500 travel grant.  The
program officially kicks off on June 17, but the application process
already brought in several hundred patch submissions from eighteen
applicants, 137 of which were 
accepted into the staging and Xen trees—all in thirteen days. 
</p>

<p>
The program was initiated by the Linux Foundation, which found sponsors for
the first three slots, but Intel's Open Source Technology Center added
three more 
while the OPW itself came up with funding for another.  The OPW has
expanded well beyond its GNOME project roots, with eighteen different
organizations (e.g. Debian, KDE, Mozilla, Perl, Twisted, and many more)
participating in this round.  

<p>
The program pairs the interns with a mentor from
a participating project to assist the intern with whatever planned work
she has 
taken on for the three months of the each program round.  OPW is patterned
after the Google Summer of Code project, but is not only for students and
programmers as other kinds of projects (and applicants) are explicitly
allowed.  As the name would imply, it also restricts applicants to those
who self-identify as a woman.

<p>
The kernel effort has been guided by Sarah Sharp, who is a USB 3.0 kernel
hacker for Intel.  She is also one of the mentors for this round.  In late
May, she put together a <a
href="http://sarah.thesharps.us/2013/05/23/%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFopw-update/">blog
post</a> that described the application process and the patches it brought
in.  Sharp filled us in on the chosen interns.  In addition, most of
the patches accepted can be seen in her cherry-picked <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/sarah/xhci.git/log/?h=opw-kernel">kernel
git tree</a>.
</p>

<h4>The interns</h4>

<p>
Sharp will be mentoring Ksenia (Xenia) Ragiadakou who will be working on
the USB 3.0 host driver. Ragiadakou is currently studying for her bachelor's degree in
computer science at the University of Crete in Greece.  In addition to her
cleanup patches for the rtl8192u wireless staging driver,
Ragiadakou has already <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=137052855612729&w=2">found a bug</a>
in Sharp's host controller driver.
</p>

<p>
Two of the interns will be working on the Xen subsystem of the kernel with
mentors Konrad Wilk of Oracle and Stefano Stabellini of Citrix. They are Lisa
T. Nguyen, who received a bachelor's degree in computer science from the
University of Washington in 2007, and Elena Ufimtseva, who got a master's
degree in 
computer science from St. Petersburg University of Information
Technologies in 2006.  Nguyen did several <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/opw-kernel/xen">cleanup
patches</a> for Xen (along with various other cleanups) as part of the
application process, while  Ufimtseva focused on cleanups in the <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/opw-kernel/ced1401">ced1401</a>
(Cambridge Electronics 1401 USB device) driver in staging.
</p>

<p>
Lidza Louina will be working with Greg Kroah-Hartman as a mentor on further
cleanups in staging drivers.  She was working on a bachelor's degree in
computer science at the
University of Massachusetts but had to take time off to work full-time.
Her contributions were to the csr wireless driver in the staging tree.
</p>

<p>
Tülin İzer is working on parallelizing the x86 boot process with mentor PJ
Waskiewicz of Intel.  She is currently pursuing  a bachelor's
degree in computer engineering at Galatasary University in Istanbul,
Turkey.  Her application included fixes for several staging drivers.

<p>
Two other Intel-mentored interns are in the mix: Hema Prathaban will be
working with Jacob Pan on an Ivy Bridge temperature sensor driver, while
Laura Mihaela Vasilescu will be working on Intel Ethernet drivers, mentored
by Carolyn Wyborny and Anjali Singhai. Prathaban graduated in 2011 from KLN College
of Engineering in India with a bachelor's degree in computer science.  She
has been a full-time mother for the last year, so the internship provides
her a way to get back into the industry. Vasilescu is a master's student at
the University of Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania and is also the student
president of <a href="http://www.rosedu.org/">ROSEdu</a>, an organization
for Romanian open source education. Both did a number of patches; Prathaban
in the staging tree (including fixing a <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/opw-kernel/m3GhH2r-GFc/E_UQKlqPTIoJ">bug</a>
in one driver) and Vasilescu in Intel Ethernet drivers.
</p>

<h4>Getting started</h4>

<p>
As with many budding kernel developers, most of the applicants' patches
were to various staging drivers.  There was a short application window as
the kernel portion didn't get announced until a little under two weeks before
the deadline.  But that didn't seem to slow anything down as there were 41
applicants for the internships, with eighteen submitting patches and eleven
having those patches accepted into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
That level of interest—and success—is partly attributable to a <a
href="http://sarah.thesharps.us/2013/05/23/%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFopw-update/">first
patch tutorial</a> that she wrote, Sharp said. 
The tutorial 
helps anyone get started with kernel development from a fresh Ubuntu 12.04
install. It looks at setting up email, getting a kernel tree, using git,
building the kernel, creating a patch, and more.  The success was also due to strong
applicants and mentors that were "<q>patient and encouraging</q>",
she said.
</p>

<p>
The kernel OPW program was mentioned multiple times at the recently held
Linux Foundation conferences in Japan as a helpful step toward making the
gender balance of kernel developers better represent the world we live in
(as Dirk Hohndel put it).  It is also nice to see the geographical diversity
of the interns, with Asia, Europe, and North America all represented.
Hopefully South America, Africa, and Oceania will appear in follow-on
rounds of the program—Antarctica may not make the list for some time to come.
</p>

<p>
Another round of the OPW, including kernel internships, is planned for
January through March 2014 (with application deadlines in December).  The
program is seeking more interested projects, mentors, and financial backers
for the internships.  While there are certainly critics of these types of
efforts, they have so far proved to be both popular and effective.  Other
experiments, using different parameters or criteria, are definitely
welcome, but reaching out and making an effort to bring more women into the
free-software fold is something that will hopefully be with us for some
time—until that hoped-for day when it isn't needed at all anymore.

<h1>Delegating privilege with BPF tokens</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 22, 2023</br>
           </div>
The quest to enable limited use of BPF features in unprivileged processes
continues.  In <a href="/Articles/929746/">the previous episode</a>, an
attempt to use authoritative Linux security module (LSM) hooks for this
purpose was strongly rejected by the LSM developers.  BPF developer Andrii
Nakryiko has now returned with a new mechanism based on a
privilege-conveying token.  That approach, too, has run into some
resistance, but a solution for the strongest concerns might be in sight.

<p>
Nakryiko (and his employer) would like the ability to allow a process
to carry out a limited set of BPF operations without needing to hold any
special capabilities.  Currently, most BPF operations require (at least)
the <tt>CAP_BPF</tt> capability, so code that needs to use BPF
functionality must be run with privilege that often goes beyond what is
actually needed.  The security module implemented in Nakryiko's previous
attempt could have been used to allow specific operations as controlled by
the security policy, but this module required authoritative hooks (security
hooks that grant access that would otherwise be denied); such hooks are not
allowed in the kernel.  Thus, necessarily, the new approach takes a
different tack.
<p>
In early June, Nakryiko posted <a
href="/ml/bpf/20230602150011.1657856-1-andrii@kernel.org/">a patch set</a>
implementing the concept of a "BPF token" that can be used to convey
limited, BPF-related capabilities from one process to another.  A
privileged supervisor process can use a new command to the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt></a>
system call, <tt>BPF_TOKEN_CREATE</tt>, to create a token, which is
returned in the form of a special file descriptor.  The creator specifies
the operations that the token is meant to enable; these include creating
maps (with control over which types of maps can be created), loading BPF
type format (BTF) data, loading programs, and creating more tokens.
<p>
There is a flag that causes the kernel to ignore any abilities requested
that do not actually exist; its purpose is to ease the task of
writing code that works across multiple kernel versions, some of which may
not support all operations.  This option can also be used to create a token
that is valid for <i>any</i> supported operation — even those that do not
exist when the code is written.
<p><blockquote class="ad">
<b><tt>$ sudo subscribe today</tt></b>

published, and help support LWN in the process.  <a href="https://lwn.net/Promo/nst-sudo/claim">Act now</a> and you can start with a free trial subscription.
</blockquote>
<p>
Once created, a token can be passed to another process with the usual
<tt>SCM_RIGHTS</tt> mechanism.  It is also possible to "pin" a token into
the <a href="/Articles/664688/">BPF filesystem</a>, making it usable to
any process that is able to access that filesystem.  Pinning can be a way
to inject a BPF token into a running container, for example.  Since the BPF
filesystem is namespace-aware, pinning a token into a specific container's
filesystem does not make that token globally visible.
<p>
Most <tt>bpf()</tt> calls use a command-specific structure in the sprawling
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc7/source/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h#L1320"><tt>bpf_attr</tt>
union</a>.  When token support is added to a specific command, that
command's structure gains a new integer field where the caller can place
their token.  If a token is present and grants the ability to carry out the
requested operation, the request will proceed regardless of whether the
calling process has the needed capabilities.  As is <a
href="/Articles/933182/">the case with BPF generally</a>, a value of zero
indicates "no file descriptor" (and thus no token), so file descriptor zero
cannot be used to represent a BPF token.
<p>
The first posting of this work drew <a
href="/ml/bpf/1930272b-cfbe-f366-21ca-e9e7a51347be@schaufler-ca.com/">a
response</a> from security developer Casey Schaufler, who was
unenthusiastic:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Token based privilege has a number of well understood weaknesses,
	none of which I see addressed here. I also have a real problem with
	the notion of "trusted unprivileged" where trust is established by
	a user space application. Ignoring the possibility of malicious
	code for the moment, the opportunity for accidental privilege
	leakage is huge.
</blockquote>
<p>
Later, in response to <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4BzZ5adUcs1qaHx34ZuXMyG6ByczyUqpFKq=+CtxPHYgEVQ@mail.gmail.com/">a
request</a> from Nakryiko, Schaufler <a
href="/ml/bpf/24dcbfec-1527-ab14-9726-ca91d68f35d4@schaufler-ca.com/">described</a>
some of the weaknesses he was talking about; most of them involved a token
leaking out of its intended container and being abused by an attacker.
Nakryiko <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4BzYj9YY==awasOt+ufJGJj7P2g6qC6aMxX-Phos01aUXqw@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>
that this mechanism was intended to be used in high-trust environments
where the attacker shouldn't exist, but Schaufler <a
href="/ml/bpf/a61d8739-300f-67b0-7e7a-acf8fb1a44a8@schaufler-ca.com/">said</a>
that was inadequate, and that the security mechanism had to ensure that it
could not be abused in that way.
<p>
Undeterred, Nakryiko <a
href="/ml/bpf/20230607235352.1723243-1-andrii@kernel.org/">posted a new
version</a> of the patch set a few days later with only minimal changes.
This time, it was Toke Høiland-Jørgensen who <a
href="/ml/bpf/871qik28bs.fsf@toke.dk/">raised concerns</a> about this
approach:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I am not convinced that this token-based approach is a good way to
	solve this: having the delegation mechanism be one where you can
	basically only grant a perpetual delegation with no way to retract
	it, no way to check what exactly it's being used for, and that is
	transitive (can be passed on to others with no restrictions) seems
	like a recipe for disaster.
</blockquote>
<p>
He went on to suggest the creation of a privileged process that could
receive BPF requests via remote procedure calls and apply whatever policy
made sense before executing them.  Nakryiko <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4BzYin==+WF27QBXoj23tHcr5BeezbPj2u9RW6qz4sLJsKw@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>
that this design would not work well in practice — an answer that was <a
href="/ml/bpf/CA+khW7h95RpurRL8qmKdSJQEXNYuqSWnP16o-uRZ9G0KqCfM4Q@mail.gmail.com/">echoed</a>
by Hao Luo, who described Google's experience with that pattern.
<p>
Djalal Harouni also <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEiveUdU7On9c27iek2rRmqSLFTKduNUtjEAD0iaCPQ4wZoH6Q@mail.gmail.com/">expressed</a>
concerns that tokens could leak between containers, and suggested that a
BPF token should be an attribute of a specific BPF filesystem instance.
That, he said, would help to attach the token to a specific namespace,
preventing leakage and matching how other credentials are handled.
Christian Brauner <a
href="/ml/bpf/20230614-geruch-verzug-db3903a52383@brauner/">agreed</a> with
that suggestion.
<p>
In response, Nakryiko <a
href="/ml/bpf/CAEf4BzawogpzENKC=KYk+mvc375ZF8Rs0gnu5grOywUsM0AV+Q@mail.gmail.com/">acknowledged</a>
the concern and the suggested solution:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The main worry is that BPF token, once issued, could be
	illegally/uncontrollably passed outside of container, intentionally
	or not. And by having this association with mount namespace
	(through BPF FS) we automatically limit the sharing to only contain
	that has access to that BPF FS.
</blockquote>
<p>
He suggested a slightly different implementation, though, based on his
desire to allow a namespace to have more than one token: the creation of a
BPF token could include a file descriptor identifying a BPF filesystem
instance.  The resulting token could only be pinned into that specific
filesystem instance, and would be prevented, somehow, from leaving the
mount namespace where that filesystem instance exists; "<q>specific details
to be worked out</q>".
<p>
<a href="/ml/bpf/20230621233809.1941811-1-andrii@kernel.org/">Version 3 of
the patch set</a>, posted on June&nbsp;22, implemented a step in this
direction.  In this version, creating a token and pinning it into a BPF
filesystem are done in a single operation, and it is no longer possible to
pin a token after creation.  That will keep tokens from being pinned
outside of the intended context, but does not address the possibility that
a token could be deliberately leaked via <tt>SCM_RIGHTS</tt>.  So
Nakryiko's objective that a BPF token "<q>cannot leave the boundaries of
that mount namespace</q>" has not yet been fully achieved.

<p>
Whether that change is enough to address the concerns that have been
expressed remains to be seen.  Then we will have to see whether the more
security-oriented developers in the community are willing to accept a
token-based mechanism in general.  If not, it would probably be a good time
for them to suggest a workable alternative.  Should no such problems arise,
though, BPF tokens may make an appearance in a near-future kernel release.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

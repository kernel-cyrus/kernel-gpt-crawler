<h1>Flushing out pdflush</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="GAByline">
           <p>April 1, 2009</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Goldwyn Rodrigues</p>
           </div>
The kernel page cache contains in-memory copies of data blocks
belonging to files kept in persistent storage. 
Pages which are written to by a processor, but not yet written to disk, are
accumulated in cache and are known as "dirty" pages. The amount of
dirty memory is listed in <tt>/proc/meminfo</tt>. Pages in
the cache are flushed to disk after an interval of 30&nbsp;seconds. Pdflush
is a set of kernel threads which are responsible for writing the
dirty pages to disk, either explicitly in response to a <tt>sync()</tt> call, or
implicitly in cases when the page cache runs out of pages, if the
pages have been in memory for too long, or there are too many dirty pages
in the page cache (as specified by <tt>/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio</tt>).
<p>
At a given point of time, there are between two and eight pdflush threads running in the
system. The number of pdflush threads is determined by the load on the
page cache;  new pdflush threads are spawned if
none of the existing pdflush threads have been idle for more than
one second, and there is more work in the pdflush work queue. 
On the other hand, if the last active pdflush thread has been asleep
for more than one second, one thread is terminated. Termination of
threads happens until only a minimum number of pdflush
threads remain. The current number of running pdflush threads is
reflected by <tt>/proc/sys/vm/nr_pdflush_threads</tt>.
<p>
A number of pdflush-related issues have come to light over time.
Pdflush threads are common to all block devices, but it is thought that
they would perform better if they concentrated on a single disk spindle. 
Contention between pdflush threads is avoided through the use of the
<tt>BDI_pdflush</tt> flag on the <tt>backing_dev_info</tt> structure, but
this interlock can also limit writeback performance.
Another issue with pdflush is
request starvation.  There is a fixed number of I/O requests available for each
queue in the system. If the limit is exceeded, any application
requesting I/O will block waiting for a new slot. Since pdflush works on several
queues, it cannot block on a single queue. So, it sets the
<tt>wbc-&gt;nonblocking</tt> writeback information flag. If other applications continue to write on the
device, pdflush will not succeed in allocating request slots.
This may lead to starvation of
access to the queue, if pdflush repeatedly finds the queue congested.
<p>
Jens Axboe in his <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324833/">patch set</a> proposes a new
idea of using flusher threads per backing device info (BDI), as a
replacement for
pdflush threads. Unlike pdflush threads, per-BDI flusher threads focus
on a single disk spindle. With per-BDI flushing, when the
request_queue is congested, blocking happens on request allocation,
avoiding request starvation and providing better fairness.
<p>
With pdflush, The dirty inode list is stored by
the super block of the filesystem. Since the per-BDI flusher needs to
be aware of the dirty pages to be written by its assigned device, this list is now stored by the BDI.
Calls to flush dirty inodes on the superblock result in flushing the
inodes from the list of dirty inodes on the backing device for all
devices listed for the filesystem.
<p>
As with pdflush,  per-BDI writeback is controlled through the
<tt>writeback_control</tt> data structure, which instructs the writeback code
what to do, and how to perform the writeback.  The important fields of this
structure are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>sync_mode</tt>: defines the way synchronization should be performed
     with respect to inode locking. If set to WB_SYNC_NONE, the writeback
     will skip locked inodes, where as if set to WB_SYNC_ALL will wait for
     locked inodes to be unlocked to perform the writeback.
<p>
<li> <tt>nr_to_write</tt>: the number of pages to write. This value is
     decremented as the pages are written.
<p>
<li> <tt>older_than_this</tt>: If not NULL, all inodes older than the
     jiffies recorded in this field are flushed. This field takes precedence over
     <tt>nr_to_write</tt>. 
</ul>
<p>

The struct bdi_writeback keeps all information required for flushing
the dirty pages:
<p>
<pre>
    struct bdi_writeback {
	struct backing_dev_info *bdi;
	unsigned int nr;
	struct task_struct	*task;
	wait_queue_head_t	wait;
	struct list_head	b_dirty;
	struct list_head	b_io;
	struct list_head	b_more_io;

	unsigned long		nr_pages;
	struct super_block	*sb;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>bdi_writeback</tt> structure is initialized when the device is registered through
<tt>bdi_register()</tt>. The fields of the bdi_writeback are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>bdi</tt>: the backing_device_info associated with this
	bdi_writeback,
<p>
<li> <tt>task</tt>: contains the pointer to the default flusher thread
	which is responsible for spawning threads for performing the
	flushing work,
<p>
<li> <tt>wait</tt>: a wait queue for synchronizing with the flusher threads,
<p>
<li> <tt>b_dirty</tt>: list of all the dirty inodes on this BDI to be flushed,
<p>
<li> <tt>b_io</tt>: inodes parked for I/O,
<p>
<li> <tt>b_more_io</tt>: more inodes parked for I/O; all inodes queued for
	flushing are inserted in this list, before being moved to
	<tt>b_io</tt>,
<p>
<li> <tt>nr_pages</tt>: total number of pages to be flushed, and
<p>
<li> <tt>sb</tt>: the pointer to the superblock of the filesystem which
	resides on this BDI.
</ul>
<p>
<tt>nr_pages</tt> and <tt>sb</tt> are parameters passed asynchronously to
the the BDI flush thread, and are not fixed through the life of the
<tt>bdi_writeback</tt>. This is done to facilitate devices with multiple
filesystem, hence multiple super_blocks. With multiple super_blocks
on a single device, a sync can be requested for a single filesystem
on the device.
<p>
The <tt>bdi_writeback_task()</tt> function waits for the
	<tt>dirty_writeback_interval</tt>, 
which by default is 5 seconds, and initiates <tt>wb_do_writeback(wb)</tt>
periodically. If there are no pages written for five minutes, the flusher
thread exits (with a grace period of <tt>dirty_writeback_interval</tt>).
If a writeback work is later required (after exit), new flusher
threads are spawned by the default writeback thread. 
<p>
Writeback flushes are done in two ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li> pdflush style: This is initiated in response to an explicit writeback
   request, for example syncing inode pages of a super_block.
   <tt>wb_start_writeback()</tt> is called with the superblock information
   and the number of pages to be flushed.  The function tries to acquire
   the <tt>bdi_writeback</tt> structure associated with the BDI. If successful, it
   stores the superblock pointer and the number of pages to be flushed in the
   <tt>bdi_writeback</tt> structure and wakes up the flusher thread to perform the
   actual writeout for the superblock. This is different from how pdflush
   performs writeouts: pdflush attempts to grab the device from the
   writeout path, blocking the writeouts from other processes.
<p>
<li> kupdated style: If there is no explicit writeback requests, the thread
   wakes up periodically to flush dirty data.  The
   first time one of the inode's pages stored in the BDI is dirtied, the 
   dirtying-time is recorded in the inode's address space. The periodic 
   writeback code walks through the superblock's inode list, writing 
   back dirty pages of the inodes older than a specified point in time. 
   This is run once per <tt>dirty_writeback_interval</tt>, which defaults
	to five seconds. 
</ul>
<p>
After review of the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/322920/">first
attempt</a>, Jens added
functionality of having multiple flusher threads per device based on
the suggestions of Andrew Morton. Dave Chinner suggested that
filesystems would like to have a flusher thread per allocation group.
In the patch set (second iteration) which followed, Jens added a 
new interface in the superblock to return the <tt>bdi_writeback</tt> structure
associated with the inode:
<p>
<pre>
    struct bdi_writeback *(*inode_get_wb) (struct inode *);
</pre>
<p>
If <tt>inode_get_wb</tt> is NULL, the default <tt>bdi_writeback</tt> of the BDI is
returned, which means there is only one <tt>bdi_writeback</tt> thread for the BDI. The
maximum number of threads that can be started per BDI is&nbsp;32.
<p>
Initial experiments conducted by Jens found an 8% increase in
performance on a simple SATA drive running <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffsb/">Flexible File System
Benchmark (ffsb)</a>. File layout was smoother as compared to the
vanilla kernel as reported by <tt>vmstat</tt>, with a uniform distribution of
buffers written out. With a ten-disk btrfs filesystem, per-BDI flushing performed
25% faster. The writeback is tracked by Jens's block layer git tree
(git://git.kernel.dk/linux-2.6-block.git) under the "writeback" branch.
There have been no comments on the second iteration so far, but
per-BDI flusher threads is still not ready enough to go into the 
2.6.30 tree.

Inelegance? 12K unswappable kernel memory per thread?<br>
<p>
A thread pool would surely be better (for something like this, anyway, in <br>
which the full complement will only be needed in extreme situations). <br>
There are several thread pools in the kernel (pdflush) or out-of-tree <br>
patches (fs-cache's slow-work threads) already. It's quite doable.<br>

It seems that by default you will have one thread per block device, which seems totally reasonable, no matter how many block devices you have. Reducing this number to less than that will mean you will be able to write data out slower, because you can't keep all devices busy. Except if you switch to a non-blocking multiplexing thread doing all write-outs, but there's probably a good reason why that's not done. For fast devices it may be better to increase the number of threads, but again, not doing that will result in slower write-out throughput.<br>
<p>
A thread pool would only be better if you would otherwise allocate too many threads per device. But if you allocated too many, there's nothing that prevents having a too high number of threads in the pool either, so it's just shuffling the problem around.<br>

The thread is only created when needed and exists after a time-out, IIRC.<br>

So it is, in effect, a thread pool. Excellent.<br>

Yes that is correct, threads are created on-demand and exit if they have been idle for some period of time.<br>
<p>
It's mostly to satisfy the people getting annoyed when looking at the ps output. An idle kernel thread is essentially free. Of course if you have 10000 logical disks in your system, you'll probably appreciate not spending memory on the threads at least.<br>

Last I heard the set of PIDs was limited to 32767 by default, and having <br>
huge numbers of even idle processes tended to slow down the PID allocator <br>
horribly.<br>
<p>
(Also, kernel threads still need a kernel stack: that's 8Kb of memory you <br>
won't see again. Not much by modern standard perhaps...)<br>

The PID allocator supposedly got fixed a few years ago, around when NPTL landed. (Here's an interview with Ingo that confirms this: <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/517">http://kerneltrap.org/node/517</a>) And if the kernel needed thousands of threads for some reason, presumably it could tweak the kernel.pid_max sysctl itself...<br>
<p>
But anyway, yeah, for ordinary systems the memory usage matters a little but not much.<br>

      Hmmm...

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>At a given point of time, there are between two and <B>eight</B> pdflush threads running in the system.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

vs.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>With a <B>ten</B>-disk btrfs filesystem, per-BDI flushing performed 25% faster</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Could a noticeable part of the 25% boost be attributed to a 25% boost in number of flushing threads?  A 10-disk btrfs filesystem ought to be generating traffic on all 10 spindles, right?

Actually, no. With btrfs, currently it assigns a per-fs backing device to each inode. So for that particular case, you have just a single bdi flusher thread running even for the 10 disks.<br>

Then why does per-bdi flusher improves that much performance for btrfs? If the key idea is *per-bdi*, there is little difference for btrfs. But where does the performance come from?<br>

           </div>
In most contemporary systems, the easiest ways to reduce power consumption
have long since been taken advantage of.  But any system component that uses
power is worth looking at to see whether it can be made to use less.
In the case of main memory, the potential power savings are said to be
significant, but they come at the expense of complicating the (already
complicated) memory management subsystem.  Now, with the latest in a long
series of memory power management patches, some developers are questioning
whether all of that complexity is called for.
<p>
Srivatsa S. Bhat's <a href="/Articles/568369/">memory power management
patch set</a> was last <a href="/Articles/547439/">covered here</a> in
April 2013.  Many of the core principles remain the same, but some of the
details have changed significantly.
<p>
The patch set is still based on the notion of dividing main memory into
"regions" that match the power-management boundaries of the underlying
hardware.  At the hardware level, a region is a range of memory that can be
powered up or down as a unit.  The fundamental goal of the memory power
management patches is to keep as many of these regions free as possible,
enabling them to be kept in a low-power state.
<p>
Regions have some similarity to the "zones" maintained by the memory
management subsystem.  But zone boundaries are defined by the kernel, and
have little to do with the hardware architecture (though zones will not
span multiple NUMA nodes).  Regions are, instead, a hardware concept.
Since there is little commonality between regions and zones,
the patch set ends up defining regions as an independent structure, almost
entirely distinct from zones.
<p>
The first step is then simple: when allocating pages, do so from the
lowest-numbered region with available pages.  That will tend to concentrate
allocations at one end of the memory range, keeping the higher-numbered
regions free.  To facilitate allocation in this mode, the page allocator's
free list 
is modified to keep free pages sorted by region; that allows pages from the
appropriate regions to be found quickly, with no need to scan through the
list.  The allocation logic is also changed a bit.  Currently, the kernel
will try to avoid splitting up large contiguous areas to satisfy an
allocation request if a suitable (and smaller) chunk of memory is
available.  The memory power management patches sacrifice that heuristic to
the extent that large chunks in low-numbered zones will be split rather
than allocating from a smaller chunk in a higher-numbered zone.
<p>
The next step is somewhat more invasive: a "region allocator" is added to
the memory management subsystem; it manages memory in large blocks
corresponding to hardware regions.  In current kernels, the page 
allocator works directly with the system's available memory; 
in the new scheme, instead,
the page allocator allocates memory from regions of memory obtained from
the region allocator.  In other words, the region allocator has been 
placed between the page allocator and physical memory.
If the page allocator needs more memory, it will request a new region from the
region allocator.  If, instead, the page allocator realizes that it has a
full region on the free list, that region can be returned to the region
allocator.
<p>
A determined effort is made to ensure that all allocations from any given
region have the same "migration type."  A page's migration type describes
how easily the contents of that page could be moved elsewhere.  Anonymous
pages for user-space use are relatively easy to move; all that is required
is to copy the data and change any page table entries that point to the
page.  Pages used in the kernel's slab allocators, instead, are firmly
nailed into place; moving such a page would require finding and changing
all of the kernel-space pointers referring to objects allocated from that
page â€” not an easily solved problem.  The purpose here is straightforward
enough: it only takes one 
non-movable page to keep an entire region powered up.  If all of those
unmovable pages can be kept separate from pages that are more easily
relocated, it will be easier to free regions of memory.
<p>
The final part of the patch set takes advantage of movable pages to
actively free zones of memory when the conditions are right.  For example,
if a region containing movable pages is mostly empty and free pages are
available elsewhere, the kernel will attempt to relocate data out of that
region and, once the region is empty, return it to the region allocator.
In other cases (clean 
page-cache pages, for example), the pages can simply be reclaimed.  
In this way, it is hoped,
the inevitable fragmentation that occurs over time can be cleaned up,
keeping the maximum number of regions free.
<p>
Most of this 40-part patch set is relatively uncontroversial, but there are
some worries about the active defragmentation measures.  If they are not
applied carefully, they could end up increasing power consumption rather
than decreasing it: moving pages around takes power, as does replacing data
in the page cache that was reclaimed prematurely.  So there needs to be
some clear evidence that the active measures help to reduce power
consumption; thus far, that evidence does not exist, since no power savings
benchmark results have been posted for some time.
<p>
More to the point, there are concerns that the active measures may reflect
a bit of a mismatch 
between the design of the patch set and how memory power management
actually happens on current hardware.  The core idea is to keep as many
memory regions entirely free of data as possible; that will allow those
regions to be powered down â€” losing all data stored therein â€” without
causing problems.  In this model, a single active page can keep a region
from being powered down, so regions must be completely evacuated for the
power savings to be realized.
<p>
 But, as Arjan van de Ven <a href="/Articles/568968/">explained</a>, memory
power management, on current Intel hardware at least, works a bit
differently.  It has a number of reduced-power modes, most of which are
entirely transparent to the operating system and preserve the data stored
in memory.  Transitions to and from the reduced-power states are quite fast,
to the point that latency problems are not a real concern.
For this type of power management to kick in, all that is
required is that the relevant region of memory be idle most of the time.
As Arjan put it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	To get the power savings, my deep suspicion (based on some
	rudimentary experiments done internally to Intel earlier this year)
	is that it is more than enough to have "statistical" level of
	"binding", to get 95%+ of the max theoretical power savings....
</div>
<p>
In other words, if a significant number of regions can be kept mostly
empty, it doesn't matter that much if the last few pages are still in
occasional use. 
That suggests that the parts of Srivatsa's patch set that control the
allocation patterns are all that's needed to reap most of the power-savings
rewards â€” on Intel hardware at least.  The active clearing of regions may
turn out to be a futile effort to gain the last few percent of the
available savings.  Of course, not all hardware is made
by Intel; results for other processors and architectures may vary.
Even on Intel systems, there may well be situations where it makes sense to
support 
full, content-destroying memory power-down.  But the fact that most of the
benefits can apparently be obtained without actively moving pages around
will argue for, at least, that feature being turned off by default.
<p>
Note the use of the word "apparently" above, though.  What is lacking from
the discussion at this point is any sort of comprehensive measurements of
actual power use with and without these patches.  Real measurements, which
generally trump more theoretical discussions, should be the deciding factor when
the memory management maintainers decide how much of this work to merge and
whether the active defragmentation functionality should be enabled by
default or not.  Either way, the bulk of the patch set seems to be
relatively uncontroversial, so we should see some sort of movement on
memory power management, finally, in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Maybe, just maybe, if we end up having PCs with part of their memory being non volatile (content not destroyed by power-down), we will need to manage hardware regions.<br>

Btw there is a focus on "free region" in this article, which is not really justified... it's just a shortcut in some ways.<br>
<p>
To give an artificially simple example; lets say we have a one single core cpu, and memory that has four regions that each is power managed separately by the hardware.<br>
<p>
If we have 4 tasks that can run, and each task's memory is in their own separate region... because only one task is running at a time, and thus only one memory region is actively being used at a time, 3 of the 4 regions are in a low power state at any one time... this is completely independent of if the regions are free or mostly free.<br>
<p>
Now, a (mostly) free region is one way of making sure that the region is accessed rarely, and its obviously quite effective at that... but just grouping different tasks to different memory regions (this sounds similar to NUMA!!) is sufficient to get power savings.<br>
<p>
And remember that by freeing memory, the disk cache gets less effective, and filling that data back in later is far from free power wise.<br>
(just like moving memory is not free in terms of power)<br>

But it seems that some RAM clears out its data when it is powered down, so that might work in a specific case, but it isn't a Good Enough solution to the problem (I suspect).<br>

there is ram "on the horizon" where you can save even more power by letting it drop its contents. Usually the size of the blocks in which this happens is pretty large (1/8th or 1/4th of total memory is quite typical) so it is by far not an easy task. The author of these patches was not really aiming for that case fwiw.<br>

is memory performance compromised by these patches?<br>
<p>
presumably I am misunderstanding the level at which ram hardware is switchable, but if most ram is "off" in order to save power and busy pages are compacted onto only a few dimms and memory controllers/channels, then wouldn't memory transactions/s and bandwidth suffer? presumably this would lead to (far more power wasting) cpu stalls.<br>
<p>
I'm also reminded of the "race to idle" cpu core scheduler discussions where somewhat counter-intuitive strategies eventually saved the most power. applications have requirements for X memory bandwidth and Y transactions and when the app is finished then the whole of ram can go idle.<br>

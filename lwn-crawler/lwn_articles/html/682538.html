The <a href="/Articles/612878/">Berkeley packet filter (BPF) mechanism</a>
has been working its way into various kernel subsystems since it was
rewritten and extended in 2014.  There is, it turns out, great value in an
in-kernel virtual machine that allows for the implementation of arbitrary
policies without writing kernel code.  A recent patch set pushing BPF into
networking drivers shows some of the potential of this mechanism — and the
difficulty of designing its integration in a way that will stand the test
of time.  If it is successful, it may change the way high-performance
networking is done on Linux systems.
<p>
<h4>Early drop</h4>
<p>
<a href="/Articles/682290/">This patch set</a> from Brenden Blanco is, in
one sense, a return to the original purpose of BPF: selecting packets for
either acceptance or rejection.  In this case, though, that selection is
done at the earliest possible moment: in the network-adapter device driver,
as soon as the packet is received.  The intent is to make the handling of
packets destined to be dropped as inexpensive as possible, preferably
before doing any protocol-processing work, such as setting up a <tt>sk_buff</tt>
structure (SKB), for those packets.
<p>
BPF programs, as loaded by the <tt>bpf()</tt> system call, have a type
associated with them; that type is checked before a program can
be loaded for a specific task.  Brenden's patch set starts by defining a
new type, <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_PHYS_DEV</tt>, for programs that will do early
packet processing.  Each program type includes a "context" for information
that is made available when the program runs; in this case, the context
needs to include information about the packet under consideration.
Internally, that context is represented by <tt>struct xdp_metadata</tt>; it
contains only the length of the packet in this version of the patch set.
<p>
The next step is to add a new <tt>net_device_ops</tt> method that drivers
can supply:
<p>
<pre>
	int (*ndo_bpf_set)(struct net_device *dev, int fd);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>ndo_bpf_set()</tt> tells the driver to install the BPF
program indicated by the provided file descriptor <tt>fd</tt>; the program
should replace the existing program, if any.  A negative
<tt>fd</tt> value means that any existing program should be removed.  There
is a new netlink operation allowing user space to set a program on a given
network device.
<p>
The driver can use <tt>bpf_prog_get()</tt> to get a pointer to the
actual BPF program from the file descriptor.  When a packet comes in, the
<tt>BPF_PROG_RUN()</tt> macro 
can be used to run the program on the packet; a non-zero return code from
the program indicates that the packet should be dropped.
<p>
<h4>Just a starting point</h4>
<p>
The interface for the running of the BPF program is where the disagreement
starts.  The driver 
must clearly give information about the new packet to the program being
run; that is done by passing an SKB pointer to <tt>BPF_PROG_RUN()</tt>.
The internal machinery hides the creation of the <tt>xdp_metadata</tt>
information from the passed-in SKB.  The mechanism seems straightforward
enough, and it takes advantage of the existing BPF functionality for
working with SKBs, but there are a couple of objections.  The first of
those is that 
the whole point of the early-drop mechanism is to avoid the overhead of
packet processing on packets that will be dropped anyway; the initial, and
not insignificant, part of that overhead is the creation of the SKB
structure.  Creating it anyway would appear to be defeating the purpose.
<p>
In truth, the one driver (<tt>mlx4</tt>) that has been modified to
implement this mechanism doesn't create a full SKB; instead, it puts the
minimal amount of information into a fake, statically allocated SKB.  That
avoids the overhead, but at the cost of creating an SKB that isn't
really an SKB.  The amount of information that needs to go into this fake
SKB will surely grow over time — there is surprisingly little call for the
ability to drop packets using their length as the sole criterion.  Whenever
new information is needed, every driver will have to be tweaked to provide
it, and, over time, the result will look increasingly like a real SKB with
the associated overhead.
<p>
The other potential problem is that there is a fair amount of interest in
eventually pushing the BPF programs (possibly after a translation pass)
into the network adapter itself.  That would allow packets to be dropped
before they come to the kernel's attention at all, optimizing the process
further.  But the hardware is not going to have any knowledge of the
kernel's SKB structure; all it can see is what is in the packet itself.  If
BPF programs are written to expect an SKB to be present, they will not work
when pushed into the hardware.
<p>
There is a larger issue, though: quickly dropping packets is a nice
capability, but high-performance networking users want to do more than
that.  They would like to be able to load BPF programs to do fast routing,
rewrite packet contents at ingress time, perform decapsulation, coalesce
large packets, and so on.  Indeed, there is a whole vision for the "express
data path" (or "XDP") built around low-level BPF packet processing; see <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpf-docs/raw/master/Express_Data_Path.pdf">these
slides [PDF]</a> for an overview of what the developers have in mind.  In
short, they want to provide the sort of optimized processing performance
that attracts users to user-space networking stacks while retaining the
in-kernel stack and all its functionality.
<p>
If the mechanism is to be extended beyond drop/accept decisions, the
information and functionality available to BPF programs will clearly have
to increase, preferably without breaking any existing users.  As Alexei
Starovoitov <a href="/Articles/682552/">put it</a>: 
"<q>We have to plan the whole project, so we can incrementally add
features without breaking abi</q>".  The current patch set does not
reflect much planning of this type; it is, instead, a request-for-comments
posting  introducing the mechanism that the XDP developers want to build on.
<p>
So, clearly, this code will not be going into the mainline in its current
form.  But it has had the desired effect of getting the conversation
started; there is, it would seem, a lot of interest in adding this feature.  
If the XDP approach is able to achieve its performance and functionality
goals, it should give user-space stacks a run for their money.  But there
is some significant work to be done to get to that point.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It's possible to do an early drop with tc too, using the u32 classifier for flexibility. And since recently, it's also possible to use eBPF. While the SKB is already created, we are still quite early and no TCP/IP code has run yet and we didn't hit any netfilter hook yet.<br>

Good point, and in the v2 patchset we had a discussion [1] about comparing the performance of the two. TL;DR is that tc+cls_bpf can drop at 6.5Mpps, compared to 20Mpps.<br>

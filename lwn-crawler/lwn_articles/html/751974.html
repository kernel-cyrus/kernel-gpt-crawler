           <p>This article was contributed by Neil&nbsp;Brown</p>
           </div>
<p>
<a href="/Articles/751374/">The first article in this series</a>  described
the interface to the "rhashtable"
resizable hash-table abstraction in Linux 4.15.  While a knowledge of
the interface can result in successful use of rhashtables, it often
helps to understand what is going on "under the hood", particularly when
those details leak out through the interface, as is occasionally the
case with rhashtable.  The centerpiece for understanding the
implementation is knowing exactly how the table is resized.  So this
follow-on article will explain that operation; it will also present the
configuration parameters that were skimmed over last time and discuss
how they affect the implementation.

<h4>The chain gang — tables within tables</h4>

<p>An rhashtable table (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.15/source/include/linux/rhashtable.h#L152"><tt>struct
rhashtable</tt></a>) contains a list of bucket tables (<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.15/source/include/linux/rhashtable.h#L76"><tt>struct
bucket_table</tt></a>).  Normally there is just one bucket table, or two
when the table is being resized.  In general there can be more, though
making this happen in practice would require adding many objects more
quickly than the table can be "rehashed",
  which is the processes of moving objects from the early bucket tables
  to the last.

<p>Each bucket table has an array of <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.15/source/include/linux/rhashtable.h#L66"><tt>struct
rhash_head</tt></a> buckets for 
the various hash chains and a separate array of spinlocks, each of which
protects two or more of the chains during modification.  The different
insert, lookup, and remove operations act on each bucket table in turn,
stopping when they find what they are looking for or when they get to the
last bucket table.  Insertion will only insert into that last table,
if anywhere.

<p>There are a few different times when a new bucket table is added to
the chain.  When an insert function finds that the total number of
objects in the table exceeds 70% of the number of buckets in the last
bucket table in the chain, it schedules an asynchronous worker thread to look into
this situation.  Similarly, when object removal finds that, in a table
where automatic shrinking is enabled, the number of objects is less
than 30% of the number of buckets, the worker is again scheduled.
This worker repeats the checks and possibly allocates a bucket table
that is either double or half the previous size.  If there is more than one
bucket table at that point, the worker
will proceed to move all objects
to the last.

<p>If insertion ever finds that the number of objects exceeds 100% of the
bucket count it assumes that the thread is taking too long, so it takes
matters into its own hands and allocates a new bucket table directly.
Since this must happen without blocking (none of the rhashtable
interfaces except <tt>rhashtable_init()</tt> and <tt>rhashtable_destroy()</tt> ever
block), that allocation can fail.  If it doesn't fail, the new object is
inserted in the new table and, hopefully, the rehashing worker thread
will eventually catch up.  Insertion will also trigger an immediate
allocation if it finds that the bucket it wanted to insert into
already has 16&nbsp;objects.  Since the table is resized to keep the average
bucket occupancy below one, this suggests that something has gone wrong
with the hash function — possibly an attacker has found a way to
generate lots of objects with the same hash.

<p>One of the per-bucket-table values is a random hash seed (<tt>hash_rnd</tt>)
that is passed to the hash function to be included in the calculated
hash.  When a new bucket table is allocated, it will have a new
<tt>hash_rnd</tt>, so objects will be placed in different chains.  This
should mean that the 17 objects that all had the same hash will now be
more evenly distributed.  This is a significant difference from the original
"relativistic hash table" implementation, which assumed
that the hash of an given object remained unchanged; the current
implementation deliberately changes it for each new bucket table.

<h4>Performing the rehash</h4>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/rhashtable.png" hspace=3 vspace=3 alt="[Moving an
object to a new table]" width=250 height=252 align="right">

<p>Whenever a new bucket table is allocated, whether to change the size of
the table
or just to change the hash seed, every object in the old table must be
moved to the new table.  This process seems
labor-intensive, but is pleasantly simple.  Since it happens rarely and is
performed asynchronously with respect to all other accesses, the cost
is unlikely to be a concern.

<p>At a simple level, the rehash process takes one object from the
old table and inserts it in the new table, then repeats that until no
objects are left.  This can only be correct if an asynchronous lookup
for that object, which proceeds with no locking, will always be
certain of finding the object.  To provide this correctness,
rhashtable always moves the <em>last</em> object from a hash chain, and
attaches it to the start of the destination hash chain.  It attaches
the object to the new chain <em>before</em> removing it from the old chain;
see the diagram to the right.  In pseudocode, the full rehash sequence is:

<pre>
    for each bucket in the first bucket table
        take a lock on the current bucket
    	while the current bucket is not empty
            find the last object in the bucket
            determine the destination bucket in the last bucket table
            lock the destination bucket
            attach the object to the head of the new bucket
            remove the object from the tail of the old bucket
       	    unlock the new bucket
        unlock the current bucket
    detach the first bucket table
</pre>

<p>This insert-before-remove sequence means there is never a time when the
object is not in the table, so a lookup will never fail to find the
object. It also means that, for a short time, a chain in the old table
is connected to a chain in the new table.  Having joined chains will
not hurt lookup as it already expects to see unwanted objects in the
chain, so a few more cannot hurt.  It also cannot hurt insert or
removal as they take bucket locks that the rehash process also takes,
so they will never see the joined chain.  It can affect a
<tt>rhashtable_walk_next()</tt> though.

<h4>Walking the hash table while the table is being rehashed</h4>

<p>As mentioned in the previous article, it is not possible to guarantee
that a walk of the hash table will see objects at most once if a rehash
could happen while the walk is proceeding.  One reason is that, as we
have just seen, the "current" object might move from one bucket table
to another and be attached to the start of a hash chain.  If that hash
chain was not empty, then the objects already there might have been
moved from a hash chain that has already been walked along.  Since hash
chains are kept short this is quite unlikely, but it is a real
possibility.

<p>When <tt>rhashtable_walk_next()</tt> completes the last hash chain in a
bucket table, it checks if there is another in the chain of tables.
Normally, there is not and <tt>rhashtable_walk_next()</tt> will return <tt>NULL</tt>
to indicate completion.  If there is, <tt>rhashtable_walk_next()</tt>
will return <tt>&#x2011;EAGAIN</tt> and prepare to walk through the next table.

When a caller receives <tt>&#x2011;EAGAIN</tt>, it will know that a rehash is
underway and, thus, it might have already seen a duplicate.  It can choose
to give up and return an error or incomplete data, or it can keep
going and expect to see every object in the table again, including any
that it might have missed the first time as they might have been
rehashed before the walker saw them.

<p>If a caller needs to be aware of rehashing, and is using
<tt>rhashtable_walk_stop()</tt> and <tt>rhashtable_walk_start()</tt> to drop the RCU read
lock, it should use <tt>rhashtable_walk_start_check()</tt> instead of
<tt>rhashtable_walk_start()</tt>.  This alternate interface will report <tt>&#x2011;EAGAIN</tt>
if the bucket table that was being walked through was discarded while
the lock wasn't held.  This has exactly the same implications as
<tt>rhashtable_walk_next()</tt> returning <tt>&#x2011;EAGAIN</tt> in that subsequent calls
will start walking the next bucket table.

<p>The only way to guarantee that a walk sees all objects exactly once
would be to disable the rehash process.  There is no documented
interface for doing this, but in the current implementation it can be
done by claiming the hash table mutex:

<pre>
    mutex_lock(&amp;my_objects.mutex);
</pre>

<p>This call will wait for any current rehash to complete, and will stop future
rehashes from starting.  If lots of objects are added while the mutex
is held, the insert function will eventually allocate a new
bucket table and will start inserting into that.  If this memory
allocation fails, the insertion will fail.  This is one of a small
number of ways that insertion can fail.

<h4>Failure during insertion</h4>

<p>It must be expected that insertion into the hash table will fail if
the key is already in use, unless of course you use
<tt>rhashtable_insert_fast()</tt>,
which doesn't check.  There are a few other circumstances that can
trigger errors; three error codes (beyond <tt>&#x2011;EEXIST</tt>) are possible:

<ul>

<li> 
<p><tt>&#x2011;ENOMEM</tt> is returned when the insert function tries to allocate
a bucket table and fails.  If the required table is larger than one
page, it will try to fall back on allocating a single page and
use that to hold pointers to other pages to be allocated later.  If
this works we might not get <tt>&#x2011;ENOMEM</tt> immediately but could still
get it if a subsequent single-page allocation fails.

</li>

<li> 
<p><tt>&#x2011;EBUSY</tt> is returned if the insert function finds that there is more
than one bucket table and the last one has 16 objects already in the
hash chain.  This is almost impossibly unlikely, unless the rhashtable is
using a custom hash function that is ignoring the random seed or doing
something else strange.

</li>

<li> 
<p><tt>&#x2011;E2BIG</tt> is returned if there are already 2<sup>31</sup> objects in the
hash table.  This prevents the element counter from overflowing.
<tt>&#x2011;E2BIG</tt> can also be returned if a maximum table size was specified
when the table was created (as described below), and the number of objects has reached
twice that maximum size.

</li>
</ul>
<h4>The full scoop on configuration parameters</h4>

<p>Now that we know how rehashing works, and how it affects walking the
table, it remains only to see how it can be configured through values
in the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.15/source/include/linux/rhashtable.h#L122"><tt>rhashtable_params</tt></a> structure.  Of the twelve fields in this
structure we have already met six (<tt>key_len</tt>, <tt>key_offset</tt>,
<tt>head_offset</tt>, <tt>hashfn</tt>, <tt>obj_cmpfn</tt>, and <tt>obj_hashfn</tt>) and five are
related to configuring the size for rehashing.
The final parameter is <tt>nulls_base</tt>.  It is essentially unused and
unusable in the current implementation, so it is best ignored.

<p>The size-related parameters are:

<ul>

<li> 
<p><tt>u16 nelem_hint;</tt>

<p><tt>nelem_hint</tt> is documented as a hint regarding the number of
elements that the table will have, but is never really used that
way; in fact I cannot imagine how anyone would be able to make a
meaningful guess.  Some callers set it to two or three with the
intention to "use a really small initial bucket table" — both of
these values result in four buckets being allocated.

<p>Other callers use values like 192, 384, or 768 which mean "use a
bigger initial table, maybe 256, 512, or 1024 buckets".  I can
understand memory conscious coders asking for a small initial
number of buckets if they don't think the table will be used
much, though the default of 64 buckets won't often be a burden.
It is harder to understand why people would use a resizable hash
table, but not just give it complete control of the size.

</li>

<li> 
<p><tt>unsigned int max_size;</tt>

<p>The <tt>max_size</tt> is rounded down to a power of two, then used as
a maximum size for the bucket table and half the maximum number of
objects in the table.  This maximum number of objects is a hard
limit; insertion will fail when it is reached.  The default maximum is
2<sup>31</sup>.

</li>

<li> 
<p><tt>bool automatic_shrinking;</tt>

<p>If this flag is set, the table will be resized downwards (halving
the size) when the residency drops below 30% (objects per bucket).
Resizing upward is always enabled, resizing downward must be
explicitly requested as in some cases it might be wasteful effort.

</li>

<li> 
<p><tt>unsigned int min_size;</tt>

<p><tt>min_size</tt> is rounded down to a power of two but kept to at least
four (the default). This puts a lower bound on resizing the bucket table.  When
<tt>automatic_shrinking</tt> is not set, this value is ignored; it does not,
for example, impose a minimum on the initial allocation.

</li>

<li> 
<p><tt>u8 locks_mul;</tt>

<p>As mentioned, each bucket table has a set of locks protecting the
buckets: two or more buckets per lock.  On machines with few CPUs,
even having only half as many locks as buckets can be wasteful
when there are a great many buckets.  To avoid wasting memory on
useless locks, rhashtable limits the number of locks using the
following formula:

<p>
<pre>
    num_locks = min(num_chains/2, locks_mul * min(num_possible_cpus, 64))
</pre>

<p>If <tt>locks_mul</tt> is not given, <tt>32</tt> is used, so by default my
eight-CPU desktop would get at most 256 locks for each bucket
table.  The only examples of setting this field in the current
kernel involve setting to it to one, which is likely to be plenty
for all but the busiest tables.

</li>
</ul>
<p>That completes the set of parameters that affect resizing.  My
recommendation would be to not set any of them unless you feel that
memory conservation is more important than raw speed, in which case
set <tt>automatic_shrinking</tt> to <tt>true</tt> and <tt>locks_mul</tt> to&nbsp;<tt>1</tt>.

<h4>A word of warning</h4>

<p>It is nice to have rhashtables properly documented, but I wouldn't
expect that situation to last.  While working on this article, I have been
discussing possible changes with the maintainers.  None of these are
major and should not invalidate this documentation, but they are
unlikely to be the last changes ever suggested.  Rhashtables are quite
different from what they were four years ago, and may be different again
in four more years — the Linux kernel is ever a dynamic place.  So
please don't trust this description implicitly — check it against the
code, just in case.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This makes me think even more that dynamic hashing would be a simple fix for this problem. It would get rid of the "change the hash seed" step.<br>
<p>
However, there are a few bits I don't understand that would need further digging. Is the "16 items per bucket" just a heuristic as to the maximum number of items that is acceptable, or is it a hard limit for some reason.<br>

Oh well, this is another project to go on my list of "when I get a round tuit" :-)<br>

i have encountered some built in bagus behaviour when automatic resizing is done (when .automatic_shrinking parameter set to true) during consecutive rhashtable_remove_fast calls which makes the remove call to fail with -ENOENT even though the key do exists in the hash table, in my opinion this happens because the resizing worker thread is not synchronized with remove call so when remove fails it looks on the "wrong" version of the table where the key do not exists (the iterator walk api do see the key when done entirely under the RCU read lock as the example code in part one of the article) , in your opinion is there any safe way to use rhashtable_remove_fast when .automatic_shrinking is true ?<br>

i answer myself so no one get confused, this should work without any problem, but need in general to commit that the key used for hash won't change during the lifetime of the hash, as resize is async. and it could extract the modified key which could lead for some unexpected behaviours<br>

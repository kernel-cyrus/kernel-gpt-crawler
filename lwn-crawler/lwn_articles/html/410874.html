           </div>
Nick Piggin's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/360199/">VFS scalability
patch set</a> has been under development for well over a year.  Some pieces
were merged for 2.6.36, but the more complicated parts were deferred
because Nick thought they needed more work and more testing.  Then things
went quiet; Nick changed jobs and went on vacation, so little work was done
for some time.  Eventually it became clear that Nick was unlikely to get
the scalability work into shape for a 2.6.37 merge.
<p>
So Dave Chinner decided to jump in and work on these patches, and the code
breaking up the inode lock in particular.  His <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/407560/">first patch set</a> was posted in
late September, with a number of revisions happening since.  Dave worked on
splitting the patch series into smaller, more reviewable chunks.  He also
took out some of the (to him) scarier changes.  Subsequent revisions
brought larger changes, to the point that <a
href="/Articles/410879/">version&nbsp;5</a> reads:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	None of the patches are unchanged, and several of them are new or
	completely rewritten, so any previous testing is completely
	invalidated. I have not tried to optimise locking by using trylock
	loops - anywhere that requires out-of-order locking drops locks and
	regains the locks needed for the next operation. This approach
	simplified the code and lead to several improvements in the patch
	series (e.g. moving inode-&gt;i_lock inside writeback_single_inode(),
	and the dispose_one_inode factoring) that would have gone unnoticed
	if I'd gone down the same trylock loop path that Nick used.
</div>
<p>
According to Dave, this patch set helps with the scalability problems he
has been seeing, and other reviewers seem to think that the patch set is
starting to look fairly good.
<p>
But then Nick returned.  While he welcomed the new interest in scalability
work, he did not take long to indicate that he was not pleased with the
direction in which Dave had taken his patches.  He has posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/410457/">a 35-part patch series</a> which he
hopes to merge; the patch posting also details why he doesn't like Dave's
alternative approach.  The ensuing discussion has been a bit rough in
spots, though it has remained mostly focused on the technical issues.
<p>
What it has not done, though, is to come up with any sort of conclusion.
There are two patch sets out there; both deal with the intersection of 
the virtual filesystem layer and the memory management code.  Much of the
contention seems to be over whether "VFS people" or "memory management
people" should have the ultimate say in how things are done.  Given the
difficult nature of both patch sets and the imminent opening of the 2.6.37
merge window, it seems fairly safe to say that neither will be merged
unless Linus makes an executive decision.  Pushing back this code to 2.6.38
will provide an opportunity for the patches to be discussed at length, and,
possibly, for the upcoming Kernel Summit to consider them as well.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

it would probably be a good thing for Linus to not merge either of them prior to the kernel summit, let discussions take place there, and then merge the set decided on in that discussion. It won't be the first time that Linus has held off on pulling a substantial patchset until -rc2, and the face-to-face discussion is worth a lot.<br>

Following the discussion, it seems to me as if Christoph Hellwig and Al Viro favor Dave Chinner's approach. I really hope they don't scare Nick away, because it's essentially his patchset and probably the most significant improvement to the core kernel since 2.6.0 came out. I really hope that Linus comes to Nicks rescue :-)<br>

I hope Linus merges Nick's patchset. Dave just wants to get something merged, no matter what. Al seems to want too much changes at once. Al also created (or is going to) a branch where he puts in the common cleanups/pacthes from both Dave's and Nick's and wants them to base their patches against the new branch, so they're easier to compare. This seems like a very good idea and should move things forwards.<br>

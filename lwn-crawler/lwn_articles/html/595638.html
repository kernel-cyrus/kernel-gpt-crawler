           </div>
<p>The Linux kernel's System V shared-memory limit has, by default, been fixed
at the same value since its inception.  Although users can increase
this limit, as the amount of memory expected by modern applications has
risen over the years, the question has become whether or not it makes
sense to simply increase the default setting&mdash;including the
option of removing the limit altogether.  But, as is often the case,
it turns out that there are users who have come to expect the
shared-memory limit to behave in a particular way, so altering it
would produce unintended consequences.  Thus, even though no one seems
happy with the default setting as it is, how exactly to fix it is not
simple.

<p>System V&ndash;style shared memory (SHM) is commonly used as an
interprocess communication resource; a set of cooperating processes
(such as database sessions) can share a segment of memory up to the
maximum size allowed by the operating system.  That limit that can be
expressed in terms of bytes per shared segment (<tt>SHMMAX</tt>),
and in terms of the total number of pages used for all SHM segments
(<tt>SHMALL</tt>).  On Linux, the default value of <tt>SHMMAX</tt> has always
been set at 32MB, and the default value of <tt>SHMALL</tt> is defined as:

<pre>
    #define SHMALL (SHMMAX/getpagesize()*(SHMMNI/16))
</pre>

<p>where <tt>SHMMNI</tt> is the maximum number of SHM
segments&mdash;4096 by default&mdash;which in turn gives a default
<tt>SHMALL</tt> of 2097152 pages.  Though they have well-known defaults,
 both <tt>SHMMAX</tt> and <tt>SHMALL</tt> can be adjusted with
<tt>sysctl</tt>.  There is also a related parameter setting the
minimum size of a shared segment (<tt>SHMMIN</tt>); unlike the other
resource limits, it is set to to one byte and cannot be changed.

<p>While most users seem to agree that one byte is a reasonable minimum segment
size, the same cannot be said for <tt>SHMMAX</tt>; 32MB does not go
far for today's resource-hungry processes.  In fact, it has been
routine procedure for several years for users to increase <tt>SHMMAX</tt> on
production systems, and it is standard practice to <a
href="http://rhaas.blogspot.com/2012/06/absurd-shared-memory-limits.html">recommend</a>
increasing the limit for most of the popular applications that make
use of SHM.

<p>Naturally, many in the community have speculated that it is high
time to bump the limit up to some more suitable value, and on March
31, Davidlohr Bueso posted <a href="/Articles/595668/">a patch</a>
that increased <tt>SHMMAX</tt> to 128MB.  Bueso admitted that the
size of the increase was an essentially arbitrary choice (a four-fold
bump), but <a href="/Articles/595669/">noted</a> in the ensuing
discussion that, in practice, users will probably prefer to make their
own choice for <tt>SHMMAX</tt> as a percentage of the total system
RAM; bumping up the default merely offers a more sensible starting
point for contemporary hardware.

<p>But Andrew Morton <a href="/Articles/595872/">argued</a> that increasing the size of the default
parameter did not address the underlying issue&mdash;that users were
frequently hitting what was, fundamentally, an artificial limit with
no real reason behind it:

<div class="BigQuote">
Look.  The 32M thing is causing problems.  Arbitrarily increasing the
arbitrary 32M to an arbitrary 128M won't fix anything - we still have
the problem.  Think bigger, please: how can we make this problem go
away for ever?
</div>

<p>One way to make the problem go away forever would be to eliminate
<tt>SHMMAX</tt> entirely, but as was pointed out in the discussion,
administrators probably do want to be able to set <em>some</em> limit
to ensure that no user creates a SHM segment that eats up all of the
system memory.  Motohiro Kosaki <a
href="/Articles/595674/">suggested</a> setting the default to zero, to
stand for "unlimited."  Bueso then <a
href="/Articles/595676/">adopted</a> that approach for the second
version of his patch.  Since <tt>SHMMIN</tt> is hardcoded to one, the
reasoning goes, <tt>SHMMAX</tt> cannot ever be misinterpreted by users
as a
valid value&mdash;either it is the default ("unlimited"), or it is the
result of an overflow.

<p>The updated patch also set the default value of <tt>SHMALL</tt> to
zero&mdash;again representing "unlimited".  But removing the limit on
the total amount of SHM in this manner revealed a second wrinkle: as
Manfred Spraul <a 
href="/Articles/595786/">pointed out</a>, setting <tt>SHMALL</tt> to
zero is currently a move that system administrators (quite reasonably)
use to disable SHM allocations entirely; the patch has the unwanted
effect of completely reversing the outcome of that move&mdash;enabling
unlimited SHM allocation.

<p>Spraul subsequently wrote his own alternative patch set that attempts
to avoid this issue by instead <a href="/Articles/595787/">setting the
defaults</a> for <tt>SHMMAX</tt> and <tt>SHMALL</tt> to <tt>ULONG_MAX</tt>,
which amounts to setting them to infinity.  This solution is not
without its risks, either; in particular there are <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=139638334330127">known</a> cases
where an application simply tries to increment the value
<tt>SHMMAX</tt> rather than setting it, which causes an overflow.  The
result would be that applications would encounter the wrong value for
<tt>SHMMAX</tt>&mdash;most likely a value far smaller than they need,
causing their SHM allocation attempts to fail.

<p>Nevertheless, Bueso concurred that avoiding the reversal of
behavior for manually setting <tt>SHMALL</tt> to zero was a good
thing, and signed off on Spraul's approach.  The latest <a
href="/Articles/595791/">version</a> of Spraul's patch set attempts to
avoid the overflow issue by using <tt>ULONG_MAX - 1L&lt;&lt;24</tt>
instead, but he admits that ultimately there is nothing preventing
users from causing overflows when left to their own devices.

<p>One final concern stemming from this change is that if a system
implements no upper limits on SHM allocation, it will be possible for
users to consume all of the available memory as SHM segments.  If such
a greedy allocation happens, however, the out-of-memory (OOM) killer
will not be able to free that memory.  The solution is for
administrators to either enable the <tt>shm_rmid_forced</tt> option
(which forces each SHM segment to be created with the
<tt>IPC_RMID</tt> flag&mdash;guaranteeing that it is associated with
at least one process, which in turn ensures that when the OOM killer
kills the guilty process, the SHM segment vanishes with it) or
to manually set SHM limits.

<p>Since the desire to avoid manually configuring SHM limits was the
original goal of the effort, it might seem as if the effort has come
full circle.  But, for the vast majority of users, removing the
ancient defaults is a welcome improvement.  Rogue users attempting to
allocate all of the memory in a shared segment are at best an anomaly
(and certainly something that administrators should stay on the
lookout for), whereas the old default 32MB SHM size has long been
problematic for a wide variety of users in need of shared memory.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

What is the reason for this limit to exist?  It sounds like writable shared pages are not swappable -- but why?  Readonly shared pages are the basis for dynamic objects, and those are swappable (but of course the backing store's the object's disk image).<br>

The whole point of writeable shared pages is, presumably, that they are shared! So if they get swapped out, rather than just affecting the process the page belongs too, it affects ALL the processes that use it. Which on a database system is likely to be ALL the user processes!<br>
<p>
If I ever get round to writing my database :-) I will probably use such shared pages as my lock table. Swap that out, and you effectively block EVERY user using the database ...<br>

Well I am not sure about rogue_users as much as rogue_applications which are going to assume that they can grab memory until they are told they can't anymore. It will be interesting to see how many of those there are.<br>

Setting aside applications that have already been written to use the hideous SysV shared memory API, is there anything that it does that cannot be done using POSIX shared memory (ie. mmap, /dev/zero, files etc)?   I really think the best thing here is not to use SysV-style shared memory at all.<br>

Yes, there are. 1) The ability to see whether there are other processes attached to a segment. That ability is the reason postgres now maps a small sysv segment to make sure there's no zombie child process around. The big majority is mapped via anonymous mmap so we don't run afaul stupid default limits. 2) Its measurably faster on some OSs. Notably Freebsd. 3) it's the widest available API that allows to attach to an existing shm segment without having to fork from the previous process. POSIX shm allows that as well, but is available on fewer platforms.<br>

I find that suprising.  Shared memory is shared memory, once it's mapped into a process, it shouldn't matter whether that was done using mmap, shmat or something else.<br>

mmap(MAP_SHARED)<br>

(Yes, you need a friendly i-node in order to rendezvous, but creating a file in /tmp is no more difficult than creating a SYSV shared memory segment.)<br>

It's annoying, but not inexplicable. Freebsd's locking seems to be different for the two cases. The locking for page faults in an mmap()ed are seem to scale significantly worse to concurrent processes than for sysv shm segments.<br>
Also kern.ipc.shm_use_phys seems to help a lot performancewise.<br>

That's not really acceptable because it'll cause writeback to the temporary file if /tmp isn't mounted as tmpfs. That's certainly not what you want for a database's buffer cache... Unfortunately tricks like opening /dev/zero and sending the fd over a socket don't seem to work..<br>

Do you have a link that explains that?<br>

Uh-huh.  It would be nice to have a standardised location that's guaranteed to be mounted with no writeback before memory pressure.<br>
<p>
But I still claim that for most applications avoiding the massive brain-damage that is SYSV IPC is well worth the slight loss of performance.<br>

Not without searching for it. There was a thread on a fbsd dev list a couple of weeks back.<br>

It's not that bad. shmget(), shmat() aren't that complex to use?<br>

Yes, they are.  You and I have gotten used to them, but when teaching system programming to fourth years, I have found that while it is reasonably easy to get them to use mmap and flock, SYSV IPC has at least the following problems:<br>
<p>
 - it uses a namespace that is independent of the filesystem (which therefore requires to agree on a unique integer, which they find confusing -- they already know how to generate a unique filename in /tmp);<br>
 - it requires the use of unusual tools in order to see what you're doing (they already know about ls and stat);<br>
 - there's no natural way to take a lock over a shmem segment, you need to use an independent semaphore (at that point they already know about flock).<br>
<p>
I've ended up removing most forms of IPC from my lecture, and limiting myself to lock files, flock, pipes, named pipes, Unix domain sockets and mmap -- anything more, and the students end up with the feeling that Unix IPC is an unstructured mess where every primitive uses completely different naming and calling conventions.<br>

Well, with respect to the dog's breakfast that is SysVIPC, your students' feelings would be correct. It *is* an unstructured mess...<br>

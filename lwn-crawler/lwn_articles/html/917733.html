           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 15, 2022</br>
           </div>
Once upon a time, Linus Torvalds would try to set a pace of about 1,000
changesets pulled into the mainline each day during the early part of the
merge window.  For 6.2, though, the situation is different; no less than
9,278 non-merge changesets were pulled during the first two days.  Needless
to say, these commits affect the kernel in numerous ways, even though there
are fewer fundamental changes than were seen in 6.1.
<p>
The most significant changes merged for 6.2 so far include:
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The arm64 architecture can now enable or disable software-implemented
     shadow stacks at boot time; this is done by patching in the relevant
     instructions where necessary.  This change allows a single kernel to
     work efficiently on systems both with pointer authentication (where shadow
     stacks don't really add much) and without.
<li> The Intel "asynchronous exit notification" mechanism is now supported;
     this allows code in <a
     href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html">SGX</a>
     enclaves to detect single-step attacks.
<li> There is a new set of operations allowing a hypervisor to support
     requests from Intel <a
     href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html">TDX</a>
     guests; <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6c8c1406a6d6">this
     documentation commit</a> has some more information.
<li> There is a new sysctl knob to control how x86 systems respond to
     processes executing split locks; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/727209376f49">this commit</a> for
     an overview and <a href="/Articles/911219/">this article</a> for the
     background. 
</ul>

<p>
<h4>BPF</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> BPF programs have increased access to control-group local storage; see
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d43198017ea3">this documentation
     commit</a> for details.
<li> BPF programs can now define types, allocate objects, and create their
     own data structures; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/db6bf999544c">this merge
     message</a> gives an overview.
<li> It is now possible for BPF code to access and store
     <tt>task_struct</tt> objects; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/efc1970d683f">this commit</a> for
     an overview.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> It is now possible to move a process into a new time namespace when
     it calls <tt>exec()</tt>.  Among other things, this allows a process
     to execute the <tt>vfork()</tt>+<tt>exec()</tt> sequence after
     unsharing its time namespace, which does not work in current kernels.
<li> More Rust infrastructure code has been merged; see <a
     href="/Articles/914458/">this article</a> for details.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Squashfs filesystems can now be mounted with the <tt>threads=</tt>
     option to control how parallel decompression is done; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/80f784098ff4">this commit</a> for
     details.
<li> Squashfs can also now handle <a href="/Articles/896255/">ID-mapped
     mounts</a>. 
<li> The kernel's handling of POSIX access-control lists has been massively
     reworked.  There should be no user-visible changes.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6a518afcc206">This merge commit</a>
     contains a detailed overview of what was done.
<li> The fscrypt mechanism can now make use of the SM4 encryption algorithm
     though, as detailed in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8129bac60f30">this merge
     message</a>, the fscrypt maintainer recommends against its use.
<li> The reliability of the much-maligned Btrfs RAID5 and RAID6
     implementation has been improved; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/149c51f87632">this merge
     message</a> describes the changes that were made.  There have also
     been more performance improvements merged for Btrfs.
<li> The kernel can now be built without NFSv2 support; this is the next
     step toward removing that support entirely.
<li> Permissions checks for access to NVMe devices have changed; operations
     that read or write a given device will now succeed if the writing
     process has the appropriate access in the permission bits on the
     device special file.  Previously, <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> was required
     for such operations.
<li> The packet CD/DVD driver, deprecated in 2016, has finally been
     removed.
     
</ul>

<p>

     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8c5577a5ccc6">this documentation
     commit</a> gives an overview of the new subsystem.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new <tt>rv</tt> tool can be used to control the operation of the
     <a href="/Articles/857862/">runtime verification</a> subsystem.  See

     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/957ed5e7129f">described</a> as:
     <p>
     <blockquote class="bq">
     PLB (Protective Load Balancing) is a host based mechanism for load
     balancing across switch links. It leverages congestion signals(e.g. ECN)
     from transport layer to randomly change the path of the connection
     experiencing congestion.
     </blockquote>
     <p>
     <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544216.3544226">This
     paper</a> has more details.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <tt>RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER</tt> and <tt>RANDOM_TRUST_CPU</tt>
     configuration options have been removed; the only way to set those
     parameters now is with a command-line option.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b9b01a5625b5">this commit</a> for
     more information.
<li> The Landlock security module can now control file truncation
     operations.  <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ede2a34363a5">This
     documentation commit</a> has some more information.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The read-copy-update (RCU) subsystem has a new "lazy" mode (controlled
     by the <tt>RCU_LAZY</tt> configuration option).  When this mode is
     active, the handling of RCU callbacks will be delayed so that those
     callbacks can be run in larger batches.  On lightly loaded systems,
     the result can be a 5-10% power savings.  For callbacks that can't
     wait, there is a new <tt>call_rcu_hurry()</tt> function.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3cb278e73be5">This commit</a> has
     the details.
<li> As described in <a href="/Articles/911914/">this article</a>, the
     <tt>char</tt> type will now default to <tt>unsigned</tt> on all
     architectures. 
<li> The SLOB slab allocator, which was designed for small-memory systems,
     has been deprecated and will likely be removed in a future release.
     Any remaining users are encouraged to move to SLUB, as the other
     allocator (SLAB) will eventually be targeted as well.  To help on
     smaller systems, there is a new <tt>SLUB_TINY</tt> configuration
     option that reduces the SLUB allocator's memory requirements.
<li> Support for message-signaled interrupts (MSIs) has been massively
     reworked to deal with years of technical debt and upcoming
     technologies.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9d33edb20f7e">This merge commit</a>
     describes the situation in great detail.
<li> There have been changes to the timer subsystem as well.
     <tt>del_timer()</tt> and <tt>del_timer_sync()</tt> have been renamed
     to <tt>timer_delete()</tt> and <tt>timer_delete_sync()</tt>
     respectively.  There are new functions, <tt>timer_shutdown()</tt> and
     <tt>timer_shutdown_sync()</tt>, which are meant to ease the task of
     cleaning up timers that might be rearmed during that process; once
     they are called, any attempts to rearm the timer will be ignored.

</ul>
<p>
If the usual two-week schedule is followed, the 6.2 merge window can be
expected to end on December&nbsp;25.  Given the significance of that date
and a number of warnings from Torvalds, though, it would not be at all
surprising if this merge window ended up being shorter than usual.
Whatever happens, LWN will follow up with a summary of the changes that
were pulled once 6.2-rc1 has been released.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

That should probably read:<br>
<p>
"The kernel can now be built without NFSv2 server support."<br>
<p>
Prior to this, support for NFSv2 and v3 were was always built in. With this change, v3 is always supported, but v2 support is now optional. v4 support has always been optional.<br>

Sure, but the NFS client code has been able to do this since 2012, so both statements are correct. :-)<br>

I see no evidence that SM4 is weaker than AES. "it's from China" plays well on Fox News, but I like to think we have a higher standard of proof than that.<br>
<p>
It's been a published algorithm since 2012. The best known attack is based on a 22-round version instead of the specified 32. Arguably, Rijndael is closer to being broken than SM4.<br>

I say this because as a Chinese I know how our gov works. They are control freaks. <br>

The PKI standards built upon these cipher suites are called 双证书体系 or Dual-Certificate System. A user has to use saparate key pairs for encryption and signature. The encryption cert private key is issued by the key authority. The signature cert private key is generated by yourself and signed by the CA like a normal certificate. <br>

So the gov can easily decrypt your communication while you have no plausible deniability. This is crazy. I doubt any sane person will trust those ciphers seeing this dual-cert system.<br>

Dual-certificate design, or TLCP can sniff traffic content, but this can only be done on the premise of having a key, which does not mean that the SM2/3/4 algorithm itself is flawed, and there is currently no evidence that the algorithm itself it is not safe. of course, a dual-certificate system like TLCP will never be introduced into community software.<br>

<p>
Yes, but that approach would work with any asymmetric cryptosystem (such as RSA). It doesn't indicate a weakness in the actual ciphers used in China. On the contrary, if the ciphers themselves were in fact backdoored, the Chinese government wouldn't even need to go through this elaborate “dual-certificate” song-and-dance routine in the first place.

      That is certainly a possibility.  The British planted stories of spies to cover up the existence of Ultra (their successful cryptanalysis).

<p>OTOH, the PRC government may just want their own cypher for fear of an NSA backdoor in cyphers coming from elsewhere.

There are no constants in SM4 that are not derived from first principles. Just like AES, SM4 uses S-boxes for the round function. They are calculated using different polynomials, but otherwise they are very similar.<br>
<p>
So it's extremely unlikely that SM4 is backdoored. And if it is, then AES is also pretty much guaranteed to be just as vulnerable.<br>
<p>
It doesn't mean that everyone should switch to SM4, it's simply not a good modern cipher from a purely practical standpoint.<br>

“ The eight S-boxes of DES were the subject of intense study for many years out of a concern that a backdoor (a vulnerability known only to its designers) might have been planted in the cipher. The S-box design criteria were eventually published (in Coppersmith 1994) after the public rediscovery of differential cryptanalysis, showing that they had been carefully tuned to increase resistance against this specific attack. Biham and Shamir found that even small modifications to an S-box could significantly weaken DES.[4]”<br>
From Wikipedia.  From your description, you know more of the details of S-box creation than I do, but this sure sounds like an S-box could be weak in a way that might not be apparent to others.<br>

S-Boxes in DES were basically chosen experimentally, they are not a result of any "nothing up my sleeves" process.<br>
<p>
In contrast, both AES and SM4 use algorithmically generated S-Boxes. The algorithms are very similar, so it's highly unlikely that only one of them is vulnerable.<br>

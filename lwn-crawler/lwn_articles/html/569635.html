</div>
<p>
Address-space layout randomization (ASLR) is a well-known
technique to make exploits harder by placing various objects at random,
rather than fixed, addresses.  Linux has long had ASLR for user-space
programs, but Kees Cook would like to see it applied to the kernel itself
as well. He outlined the reasons why, along with how his patches work, in a
<a
href="http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Linux_Security_Summit_2013">Linux
Security Summit</a> talk.  We <a href="/Articles/546686/">looked</a> at
Cook's patches back in April, but things have changed since then; the code was
based on the 
original <a href="/Articles/444503/">proposal</a> from Dan Rosenberg back
in 2011. 
</p>

<h4>Attacks</h4>

<a href="/Articles/569839/">

</a>

<p>
There is a classic structure to many attacks against the kernel, Cook
said.  An attacker needs to find a bug either by inspecting kernel code,
noticing something in the patch stream, or following CVEs.  The attacker can then
use that bug to insert malicious 
code into the kernel address space by various means and redirect the
kernel's execution to that that code.  One of the easiest ways to get root
privileges is to execute two simple functions as follows:
<pre>
    commit_creds(prepare_creds());
</pre>
The existence of those function has made things "infinitely easier for an
attacker", he said.  Once the malicious code has been run, the exploit will
then clean up after itself.  For an example, he pointed to Rosenberg's <a
href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15285/">RDS protocol local
privilege escalation exploit</a>.
</p>

<p>
These kinds of attacks rely on knowing where symbols of interest live in
the kernel's address space.  Those locations change between kernel versions and
distribution builds, but are known (or can be figured out) for a particular
 kernel. ASLR disrupts that process and adds another layer of
difficulty to 
an attack. 
</p>

<p>
ASLR in user space randomizes the location of various parts of an
executable: stack, mmap region, heap, and the program text itself.
Attacks have to rely on information leaks to get around ASLR.  By
exploiting some other bug (the leak), the attack can find where the code of
interest has been loaded.
</p>

<h4>Randomizing the kernel's location</h4>

<p>
Cook's kernel ASLR (KASLR) currently only randomizes where the kernel code
(i.e. text) is placed at boot time.  KASLR "has to start somewhere", he
said. In the future, randomizing additional regions is possible as well.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of benefits to KASLR.  One side effect has been moving
the interrupt descriptor table (IDT) away from the rest of the kernel to a
location in read-only memory. 
The unprivileged <tt>SIDT</tt> instruction can be used to get the location
of the IDT, which could formerly have been used to figure out where the
kernel code was located.  Now it can't be used that way because the IDT is
elsewhere, but it is also 
protected from overwrite because it is read-only.
</p>

<p>
ASLR is a "statistical defense", because brute force methods can generally
be used to overcome it.  If there are 1000 locations where the item of
interest could reside, brute force will find it once and fail 999 times. In
user space, that failure will lead to a crash of the program, but that may
not raise the kind of red flags that crashing 999 machines would.  The
latter is the likely outcome from a wrong brute force guess against KASLR.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, KASLR is not compatible with hibernation (i.e. suspend
to disk).  That is a solvable problem, Cook said, but is not interesting to
him.  The amount of space available for the kernel text to move around in
is another problem.  The code must be 2M aligned because of page table
restrictions, and 
the space available is 2G.  In a "perfect world", that would give 1024
slots for the location.  In the real world, it turns out to be a fair
amount less.
</p>

<p>
There are also some steps that need to be taken to protect against
information leaks that can be used to determine where the kernel was
loaded.  The <tt>kptr_restrict</tt> sysctl should be enabled so that kernel
pointers are not leaked to user space.  Similarly, <tt>dmesg_restrict</tt>
should be used as dmesg often has addresses or other information that can
be used.  Also, log files (like <tt>/var/log/messages</tt>) should have
permissions for root-only access.  

<p>
The last source of leaks he mentioned is conceptually
easy to fix, but has run into resistance from the network subsystem
maintainers.  The <tt>INET_DIAG</tt> socket API uses the address of a
kernel object as a handle.  That address is opaque to user space, but it is
a real 
kernel pointer, so it can be used to determine the kernel location.
Changing it to some obfuscated value would fix the problem, but the network
maintainers are not willing to do so, he said.
</p>

<p>
In a completely unconfined system, especially one with local untrusted
users, KASLR 
is not going to be very useful, Cook said.  But, on systems that use
containers or have heavily contained processes, KASLR can help.  For
example, the renderer process in the Chrome browser is contained using the
<a
href="http://blog.cr0.org/2012/09/introducing-chromes-next-generation.html">seccomp-BPF
sandbox</a>, which restricts an exploit to the point where it shouldn't be
able to get the information needed.  It is also useful to protect against
attacks via remote services since there are "many fewer leaks" available
remotely. 
</p>

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>
KASLR has been added to Chrome OS, Cook said.  It is in the Git tree for
the distribution's kernel and will be rolled out in the stable release
soon.  He has a reputation for "bringing disruptive security changes to people
who did not necessarily want them", he said with a smile, but KASLR was
actually the "least problematic" of his proposed changes.  Part of the
reason for that is that "several other very smart people" have helped,
including Rosenberg, other Google developers, and folks on the kernel
mailing list.
</p>

<p>
Cook's patches change the boot process so that it determines the lowest
safe address where the kernel could be placed.  It then walks the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E820">e820</a> regions counting
kernel-sized slots.  From those, it chooses a slot randomly using the best
random number source available.  Depending on the system, that would be from the
<tt>RDRAND</tt> instruction, the low bits from a <tt>RDTSC</tt> (time stamp
counter), or bits from the timer I/O ports.  After that, it decompresses
the kernel, handles the relocation, and starts the kernel.
</p>

<p>
The patches are currently only for 64-bit x86, though Cook plans to look at
ARM next.  He knows a "lot less" about ARM, though, so he is hoping that he
can "trick someone into helping me", he said.
</p>

<p>
The current layout of the kernel's virtual address space only leaves 512M
for the 
kernel code—and 1.5G for modules.  Since there is no need for that much
module space, his patches reduce that to 1G, leaving 1G for the kernel,
thus 512 possible slots (as it needs to be 2M aligned).  The number of
slots may increase when the modules' location is added to KASLR.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/569840/">

alt="[Kees Cook]" width=200 height=112>
</a>

<p>
A demonstration of
three virtual machines, with one running a "stock" kernel and two running the KASLR code, was up next.  Looking at
<tt>/proc/kallsyms</tt> and <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables</tt>
on each showed different addresses.  Cook said that he was unable to find a
measurable 
performance impact from KASLR.
</p>

<p>
The difference in addresses makes panics harder to decode, so the offset
of the slot used to locate the kernel has been added to that output.  He
emphasized that information leaks are going to be more of a problem for
KASLR-enabled systems, noting that it is somewhat similar to Secure Boot
now making a distinction between root and kernel ring 0.  For the most
part, developers didn't care about kernel information leaks, but that needs
to change.
</p>

<p>
There are some simple steps developers can take to avoid leaking kernel
addresses, he said.  Using the "<tt>%pK</tt>" format for printing addresses
will show regular users 0, while root still sees the real address (if
<tt>kptr_restrict</tt> is enabled, otherwise everyone sees the real
addresses).  The contents of dmesg need to be 
protected using <tt>dmesg_restrict</tt> and the kernel should not be using
addresses as handles.  All of those things will make KASLR an effective
technique for thwarting exploits—at least in restricted environments.

Very minor correction: KASLR is working on both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 (with 256 and 512 possible random positions respectively), not just 64-bit. I do still want to make this work on ARM, though. :)<br>

I understand that huge pages are 2M, but why does that mean the kernel can only go at 2M boundaries?  Isn't it possible to have ELF-style symbol relocations so the kernel can be moved to smaller offsets within the page (eg. the kernel would start at 2M page boundary + 1 byte)?<br>
<p>
Anyway, here's hoping that once this is implemented, Ubuntu will make the vmlinuz files public readable again (and thus gain the much bigger security benefits of using libguestfs and VM sandboxes for user processes).<br>

Really?<br>
<p>
Laying bare your code/data layouts for the local would-be-root's perusal is nothing?<br>
<p>
OTOH, if your logic goes along the lines of "there's so many other places you can get that information from, it just doesn't matter" -- I could agree.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>March 10, 2010</br>
           </div>
<p>
A recent linux-kernel discussion, which descended into flames at times,
took on the 
question of the stability of user-space interfaces.  The proximate cause
was a change in the interface for the Nouveau
drivers for NVIDIA graphics hardware, but the real
issues go deeper than that.  Though the policy for the main kernel is that
user-space interfaces live "forever", the policy in the staging tree has
generally been looser.  But some, including Linus Torvalds, believe that
staging drivers that have been shipped by major distributions should be
held to a higher standard. 
</p>

<p>
As part of the just-completed 2.6.34 merge window, Torvalds pulled from the
DRM tree at Dave Airlie's request, but immediately ran into <a href="/Articles/378014/">problems</a> on his
Fedora 12 system:
<div class="BigQuote">
Hmm. What the hell am I supposed to do about
<pre>
	(II) NOUVEAU(0): [drm] nouveau interface version: 0.0.16
	(EE) NOUVEAU(0): [drm] wrong version, expecting 0.0.15
</pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>
The problem stemmed from the Nouveau driver changing its interface, which
required an upgrade to <tt>libdrm</tt>&mdash;an upgrade that didn't exist
for Fedora 12.  The Nouveau changes have been backported into the Fedora 13
2.6.33 kernel, which comes with a new <tt>libdrm</tt>, but there are no
plans to put that kernel into Fedora 12.
Users that stick with Fedora kernels upgraded via <tt>yum</tt> won't run
into the problem as Airlie <a href="/Articles/378020/">explains</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
At the moment in Fedora we deal with this for our users, we have dependencies
between userspace and kernel space and we upgrade the bits when they upgrade
the kernels, its a pain in the ass, but its what we accepted we needed
to do to get
nouveau in front of people. We are currently maintain 3 nouveau APIs
across F11, F12
and F13.
</div>
</p>

<p>
That makes it impossible to test newer kernels on Fedora 12 systems with
NVIDIA graphics, though, which
reduces the number of people who are able to test.  In addition, there is
no "forward compatibility" either&mdash;the kernel and DRM library must
upgrade (or downgrade) in lockstep.
Torvalds is concerned
about losing testers who run Fedora 12, as well as problems for those on
Fedora 13 (Rawhide right now) 
who might need to bisect a kernel bug&mdash;going back and forth across the
interface-change barrier is not possible, at least easily.  In his original
complaint, Torvalds is characteristically blunt: "<q>Flag days aren't
acceptable.</q>" 
</p>

<p> The Nouveau drivers were only <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/366648/">merged for 2.6.33</a> at Torvalds's
request&mdash;or demand&mdash;and they were put into the staging tree.  The
staging tree configuration option clearly spells out the instability of
user-space interfaces: "<q>Please note that these drivers are under
heavy development, may or may not work, and may contain userspace
interfaces that most likely will be changed in the near future.</q>".
So several kernel hackers were clearly confused by Torvalds's outburst.
Jesse Barnes <a href="/Articles/378026/">put it</a> this way:
<div class="BigQuote">
Whoa, so breaking ABI in staging drivers isn't ok?  Lots of other
staging drivers are shipped by distros with compatible userspaces, but I
thought the whole point of staging was to fix up ABIs before they
became mainstream and had backwards compat guarantees, meaning that
breakage was to be expected?
<p>
Yes, it sucks, but what else should the nouveau developers have done?
They didn't want to push nouveau into mainline because they weren't
happy with the ABI yet, but it ended up getting pushed anyway as a
staging driver at your request, and now they're stuck?  Sorry this
whole thing is a bit of a wtf...
</div>
</p>

<p>
But Torvalds doesn't disagree that the interface needs changing, he is just
unhappy with the way it was done.  Because the newer <tt>libdrm</tt> is not
available for Fedora 12, he can't <a href="/Articles/378032/">test it</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
I'm not going to release a kernel that I can't test. So if I can't get a 
libdrm that works in my F12 environment, I will _have_ to revert that 
patch that you asked me to merge.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It is not just Torvalds who can't test it, of course, so he would like to
see something done that will enable Fedora users to test and bisect
kernels.  The Nouveau developers don't want to maintain multiple
interfaces, and the Fedora (and other distribution) developers don't want
to have to test multiple versions of the DRM library.  As Red Hat's Nouveau
developer Ben Skeggs <a href="/Articles/378034/">put it</a>: "<q>we have no intention of
keeping crusty APIs around when they aren't what we require.</q>" 
</p>

<p>
Torvalds would like to see a way for the various <tt>libdrm</tt>s to
co-exist, preferably with the X server choosing the right one at
runtime.  As he <a href="/Articles/378042/">notes</a>, the server has the
information and, if multiple libraries are installed, the right one is only
a <tt>dlopen()</tt> away:
<div class="BigQuote">
Who was the less-than-rocket-scientist that decided that the right thing 
to do was to "check the kernel DRM version support, and exit with an error 
if it doesn't match"?
<p>
See what I'm saying? What I care about is that right now, it's impossible 
to switch kernels on a particular setup. That makes it effectively 
impossible to test new kernels sanely. And that really is a _technical_ 
problem.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In the end, Airlie helped him <a href="/Articles/378047/">get</a> both of the proper libraries installed on
his system, with a symbolic link to (manually) choose between them.  That
was enough to allow testing of the kernel, thus Torvalds didn't revert the
Nouveau patch in question.  But there is a larger question here:  When
should a user-space interface be allowed to change, and, just how should it
be done?
</p>

<p>
The Nouveau developers seem rather unhappy that Torvalds and others are
trying to change their development model, at least partially because they
never requested that Nouveau be merged.  But Torvalds is not really pushing
the Nouveau developers so much as he is pushing the distributor who shipped
Nouveau to handle these kinds of problems.  In his opinion, once a major
distributor has shipped a library/kernel combination that worked, it is
responsible for ensuring that it continues to work, especially for those
who might want to run newer kernels.
</p>

<p>
The problem for testers exists because the distribution, in this case
Fedora, shipped the driver before getting it into the upstream kernel,
which violates the "upstream first" principle.  Torvalds <a
href="/Articles/378052/">makes it clear</a> that merging the code didn't
cause the problem, shipping it did:
<div class="BigQuote">
So the watershed moment was _never_ the "Linus merged it". The watershed 
moment was always "Fedora started shipping it". That's when the problems 
with a standard upstream kernel started.
</div>

<p>
Alan Cox <a href="/Articles/378053/">disagrees</a>, even quoting Torvalds
from 2004 back at himself, because the Nouveau developers are just developing the way
they always have; it's not their fault that the code was shipped and is now
upstream: 
<div class="BigQuote">
Someone who never made a commitment to stability decided to do the
logical thing. They deleted all the old broken interfaces, they cleaned
up their ioctls numbering and they tided up afterwards. I read it as the
action of someone who simply doesnt acknowledge that you have a right to
control their development and is continuing to work in the way they
intended.
</div>

<p>
But the consensus, at least among those who aren't graphics driver developers,
seems to be that user-space interfaces should only be phased out gradually.
That 
gives users and distributions plenty of time to gracefully handle the
interface change.  That is essentially how mainline interface changes are
done; even though user-space interfaces are supposed to be maintained
forever, they sometimes do change&mdash;after a long deprecation period.
In fact, Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/378049/">claimed</a> that breaking
an ABI often leads to projects that either die on the vine or do not
achieve the success that they could:
<div class="BigQuote">
I have _never_ seen a situation where in hindsight breaking the ABI of a 
widely deployed project could be considered 'good', for just about any sane 
definition of 'good'.
<p>
It's really that simple IMO. There's very few unconditional rules in OSS, but 
this is one of them.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/378055/">sees</a> handling interface changes gracefully as part of being a
conscientious member of the community.  If developers don't want to work
that way, they shouldn't get their code included into distributions:
<div class="BigQuote">
You say you don't want to do that?  Then keep it to your self and
don't get it dropped into popular distributions like Fedora or Ubuntu.
You want a larger pool of testers?  Great!  The price you need to pay
for that is to be able to do some kind of of ABI versioning so that
you don't have "drop dead flag days".
</div>
</p>

<p>
Had this occurred with a different driver, say for an obscure WiFi device, it is likely there would have been less, or no, outcry.  Because X
is such an important, visible part of a user's experience, as well as an
essential tool for testers, breaking it is difficult to hide.  Torvalds
has always pushed for more testing of the latest mainline kernels, so it
shouldn't come as a huge surprise that he was less than happy with what
happened here.
</p>

<p>
This situation has cropped up in various guises along the way.  While
developers would like to believe they can control when an ABI falls under
the compatibility guarantee, that really is almost never the case.  Once
the interface gets merged, and user space starts to use it, there will be
pressure to maintain it.  It makes for a more difficult development
environment in some ways, but the benefit for users is large.

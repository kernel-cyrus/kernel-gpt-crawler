<h1>ioctl(), the big kernel lock, and 32-bit compatibility</h1>

Despite efforts to remove the big kernel lock (BKL) from the 2.6 kernel, it
still covers large amounts of code.  Much of that code is implementations
of the <tt>ioctl()</tt> method in device drivers and filesystems throughout
the kernel.  A poorly-implemented <tt>ioctl()</tt> method can block other
processors for some time, wasting CPU time and creating high latencies.
Fixing <tt>ioctl()</tt>'s BKL use has been on the "to do" list for some
time, but nobody has dived in to get the job done.
<p>

Mike Werner has recently taken a step in that direction, however, with <a
href="/Articles/114637/">this patch</a> which aims to make it easy to wean
driver <tt>ioctl()</tt> methods off the BKL one at a time.  To that end, it
creates a new method in the <tt>file_operations</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*unlocked_ioctl) (struct inode *inode, struct file *file, 
                           unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
</pre>
<p>
This method behaves just like one would expect: if it is non-<tt>NULL</tt>,
it will be called in preference to the regular <tt>ioctl()</tt> method, and
the BKL will not be taken for that call.  New drivers can be written to use this method,
and the <tt>ioctl()</tt> methods of old drivers can be shifted over once
they are known to be safe to call without the BKL.
<p>

This is a different approach than was taken to get the BKL out of
<tt>lseek()</tt> methods.  In that case, the interface was changed by
decree, and <tt>lseek()</tt> was called without the BKL.  First, however,
every in-tree <tt>lseek()</tt> method was enhanced with an explicit
<tt>lock_kernel()</tt> call of its own.  As a result, those methods still
executed with the BKL held, but the taking of the BKL was made explicit and
put into a place where it could be removed when it was no longer needed.
A typical <tt>ioctl()</tt> method can be more complicated than most
<tt>lseek()</tt> methods, however, so the creation of a new method must
seem like the easier approach this time around.
<p>

One commenter has suggested that the new method should not include the
<tt>inode</tt> argument, since it is trivially obtained from the
<tt>file</tt> structure anyway.  The version of this patch which was merged
into 2.6.10-rc3-mm1 retains that argument, however.

<p>

Meanwhile, Michael Tsirkin has posted <a href="/Articles/115751/">a
different <tt>ioctl()</tt> patch</a> which, while it provides a non-BKL
migration path for that method, also solves another problem.  One of the
biggest challenges in writing portable <tt>ioctl()</tt> methods is dealing
with 32-bit compatibility on 64-bit systems.  When user space is running in
32-bit mode, it will have a different view of any structures passed into
<tt>ioctl()</tt>, and the kernel must translate the 32-bit versions into
something it can work with.
<p>

The kernel provides some help with this translation in the form of a function called
<tt>register_ioctl32_conversion()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef int (*ioctl_trans_handler_t)(unsigned int, unsigned int,
                                         unsigned long, struct file *);
    int register_ioctl32_conversion(unsigned int cmd, 
                                    ioctl_trans_handler_t handler)
</pre>
<p>

After this call, any 32-bit <tt>ioctl()</tt> call using the given
<tt>cmd</tt> will be passed to the <tt>handler</tt> function, which,
presumably, knows how to deal with it.  This mechanism works, but it has a
few shortcomings.  It relies on a global space for <tt>ioctl()</tt> command
codes, for example.  Every command is <i>supposed</i> to be unique, but
things do not always happen that way - especially with out-of-tree
drivers.  The use of a hash table to look up handler functions slows things
down a bit.  And, as <a href="/Articles/115753/">Andi Kleen pointed
out recently</a>, the current mechanism suffers from race conditions which appear to
be unfixable without changing the interface.
<p>

But, if you're going to change the interface, you might as well do it
right.  So Michael's patch adds two new <tt>ioctl()</tt> methods to the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure.  The <tt>ioctl_native()</tt> method
handles calls made from user-space processes which are using the same
architecture model as the kernel, while <tt>ioctl_compat()</tt> is called
in cases where the two differ.  With this approach, the global table of
commands can be eliminated, and its problems go away as well.  Since the
new <tt>ioctl_compat()</tt> method is invoked directly from the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure, it is easy to manage the module
reference count to avoid unload races. 
<p>

Oh, and the kernel does not acquire the big kernel lock before calling
either of the new methods; they are expected to be implemented with proper
locking from the beginning.
<p>

Michael's patch seems to solve all of the problems addressed by the
<tt>unlocked_ioctl()</tt> approach, plus a few more.  The debate has not
yet begun, but it would not be surprising to see the two new methods win
out in the end.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

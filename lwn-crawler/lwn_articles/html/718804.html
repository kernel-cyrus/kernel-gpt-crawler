<p>
In the filesystem track and the 2017 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit, Steve French led a discussion on various topics
of interest for network filesystems.  As with the <a
href="/Articles/685431/">discussion at LSFMM 2016</a>, there are a number
of features that the network filesystem developers would like to see added,
though there has been progress on one of primary items from last year: the <tt>statx()</tt> system call. 
</p>

</a>

<p>
French said that the addition of <tt>statx()</tt> gave Samba and other
network filesystems some things that were wanted for a long time.  The new
system call adds a "birth time" for files, as well as two of the Windows
attribute flags.  But more is needed.  Additional attribute flags, an
interface to set attributes, and something like the <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1813#section-3.3.17"><tt>READDIRPLUS</tt>
NFS command</a> are all on that list.
</p>

<p>
Samba leases, which allow the client side to aggressively cache file data,
are not fully supported.  The API lacks a way to provide a lease key in
order to upgrade an existing lease, so upgrading requires dropping the
lease, which is inefficient.  There is also no way to cache metadata and
directory contents, which Microsoft says can result in an enormous
reduction in network traffic for typical home-directory-oriented users.
</p>

<p>
French also noted that version 28 of the rich access-control list
(RichACLs) had recently been <a href="/Articles/714386/">posted</a>.  Some
small pieces of the patch set were merged over the last year, but there is
a need for full RichACL support.  Right now, NFSv4 and Samba ACLs are
mapped as best as they can be using extended attributes (xattrs).  But not
all filesystems store xattrs efficiently and he is also worried that the
mapping is imperfect, which could lead to security problems.
</p>

<p>
There are races when creating files with ACLs and other attributes right
now, French said.  Jeff Layton thought that using <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt>,
setting the ACLs and attributes on that file, then moving the file to its real
name should be sufficient to avoid those races.  French said he did not
have the details but, from what he understands, the races are unavoidable
with the current 
interfaces.   There is a surprising amount of work needed at file creation
time, he said.
</p>

<p>
Network filesystems need broader support for the fast copy options
(e.g. server-side copying and copy offload).  Almost everyone wants their
copies to be done quickly by default, but there is no Linux interface to
simply hand a source and target to and have it make the best effort to do that
copying quickly.
There is a need for a per-file snapshot interface.  Right now, there are
filesystem-specific ways to request snapshots, but it would be helpful to
have a single interface for all filesystems that can support it.  Windows
has that support, he said.
</p>

<p>
There is currently no interface to get
metadata about the filesystem itself.  There are things that XFS and Btrfs
know that could help client applications make better decisions.  The
alignment of the device, whether there is a seek penalty, or if the
<tt>TRIM</tt> command is supported are all things that would be helpful to
know.  He noted David Howells's proposal for filesystem query system call
(possibly <tt>statfsx()</tt>) that was made in the <a
href="/Articles/718222/"><tt>statx()</tt>
session</a>; the timestamp granularity example given there was a good one,
French said.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that most would probably agree that many of the interfaces
French is 
talking about would be good additions, but they are also easy to bikeshed
over so it "takes forever to get them upstream".  The filesystem
information system call is definitely needed and there is no need to
convince the kernel developers of that, but there will be three months to
three years of bikeshedding over it.  The idea behind <tt>statx()</tt> was
not controversial, Ts'o said, it's just that the details took a long time
to be worked out.
</p>

<p>
But French said that <tt>statx()</tt> is an example of progress.  It was
finally pared down to just adding birth time and two attributes, which is
great, but it is an extensible interface.  The "compressed" and "encrypted"
attributes were added with the new call, but more would be helpful and he
is optimistic that they will be added.

<p>
I thought we implemented the copy_file_range() syscall precisely for this. We have support in the NFS and CIFS clients, and support in the NFS server to offload copy operations to the local filesystems. XFS, BTRFS, and OCFS2 provide optimised implementations of this syscall, all other filesystems just do an efficient copy via the splice infrastructure (so is zero-copy?).<br>
<p>
I don't know if the CIFS server uses the copy_file_range() syscall to optimise server side copies - that's the only missing piece in this picture, right?<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; There is a need for a per-file snapshot interface.</font><br>
<p>
And that's what ioctl(FICLONE) (aka reflink) implements. Supported by all the same filesystems as the copy_file_range() syscall, so we've got full server side support there, too.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Right now, there are filesystem-specific ways to request snapshots, but it would</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; be helpful to have a single interface for all filesystems that can support it.</font><br>
<p>
All the interfaces I mentioned are VFS level interfaces so are available to be implemented by all filesystems that can...<br>

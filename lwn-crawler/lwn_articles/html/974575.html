<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
Almost immediately after the merging of <a href="/Articles/603762/">control
groups</a>, kernel developers set their sights on reimplementing them
properly.  The second version of the control-group API started trickling
into the kernel around the 3.16 release in 2014 and users have long since
been encouraged to migrate, but support for (and users of) the initial API
remain.  At the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024
Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>,
memory-management developers discussed whether (and when) it might be
possible to remove the version-1 memory controller.  The session was led by
Shakeel Butt and (participating remotely) Roman Gushchin.
<p>
<h4>Deprecation process</h4>
<p>
The first step toward an eventual deprecation is to move the version-1 code
into a separate file with its own configuration option.  That option would
also control the presence of some internal structure fields.  Michal Hocko
immediately suggested making the old version disabled by default; if it
remains enabled, he said, the community will never manage to get rid of it.
There are, he said, two classes of users for the old interface: intentional
users who have a reason to stick with it, and accidental users who are
unaware that a better interface exists.  Disabling the old interface will
motivate the second group to migrate away from it.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/974586/"><img

title="Shakeel Butt" class="lthumb"></a>

Most distributions, Butt continued, are using systemd these days, so they
could easily handle a deprecation of the old interface.  Hocko cautioned,
though, that there are a lot of containers out there stuck on
version&nbsp;1 that nobody has ever bothered to fix.  David Hildenbrand
said that there was no need to worry about distributions; they will enable
this option if it is needed.  Gushchin said that, if the option is disabled by
default, kernel developers will have to pay special attention to avoid
breaking it while making changes elsewhere.
<p>
The proposed deprecation process, once the code separation is done,
involves adding a warning to be emitted when the old interface is used;
that code would be backported to the stable kernels as well.  The next step
is "wait a while", defined as two or three long-term-support cycles
(referring to the long-term stable kernels, which have a one-year cycle).
After that, the interface would remain, but it would not actually do
anything; the code behind it would be removed.
<p>
Hocko worried that, no matter how long the warning period is, it would not
be enough.  He also said that turning the interface into a no-op is a risky
approach that could cause systems to fail silently.  Rather that do that,
he suggested just setting the version&nbsp;1 code aside and letting it
slowly decay.  David Rientjes said that this is the real point: how should
features be deprecated?  It is necessary to make users take some manual
action to continue using the deprecated feature, or it will never go away;
he suggested adding a sysctl knob to enable the old interface.
<p>
A participant pointed out that there are still features provided by the old
interface that are unavailable in version&nbsp;2.  At the top of the list
was combined accounting of memory and swap usage; without that, he said,
applications simply cannot know how much swap space they need.  Gushchin
said that there are a number of version-1 features that are no longer used,
and that not all features are equally important.  The best approach might
be to deprecate only those features; that would reduce the pressure to get
rid of the rest.
<p>
<h4>Features specific to version 1</h4>
<p>
That led to a discussion of specific version-1 features, most of which are
tersely described in <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/memory.html">this
document</a>.  The first on the chopping block was the
<tt>move_charge_at_immigrate</tt> knob, which controls how accounting for
memory is done.  A deprecation warning was added in the 6.3 kernel and
backported to older ones; should it be turned into a no-op this year?
Hocko again wondered if that was the right approach, saying that it might
be better to simply fail if somebody tries to use that knob.  One way or
the other, it was agreed that this feature makes maintenance of the memory
controller harder and should be removed.
<p>
Then, there is TCP memory accounting, which is controlled by four knobs.
This is a separate, opt-in accounting feature.  Butt made the claim that
nobody is using TCP memory accounting, its performance is terrible, and
that the version-2 implementation is far better.  Nobody disagreed
with that assessment.  This set of knobs should be relatively easy to
remove; the group agreed to start the deprecation process for them.
<p>
Next is soft limits, which are controlled by the
<tt>soft_limit_in_bytes</tt> knob.  The old version is broken (and
disabled) for systems using realtime preemption.  The version-2 API
has better-defined semantics, and provides both best-effort and hard
protections.  Nobody objected to the removal of this feature either.
<p>
The <tt>failcnt</tt> interfaces can be read to see how many times a given
control group has run into its limits; they are not exposed in the
version-2 interface, and it is not clear that anybody is using them.
It would be easy to add <tt>failcnt</tt> to version&nbsp;2, but there
should be a use case defined first.  Hocko said that this feature is not
useful, but it is almost free to support and not worth the trouble to
remove.
<p>
There are a number of notification variables (including
<tt>usage_in_bytes</tt> and <tt>oom_control</tt>) that notify a registered
user when usage goes above a given threshold. They are disabled for
realtime, and are not useful for driving the behavior of a process since
notification happens before reclaim.  But, evidently, Google uses them
internally for job control and exposes them to workloads there.  This
functionality could be had with BPF, but applications would have to
explicitly migrate over to that approach.
<p>
The <tt>oom_control</tt> knob also allows  disabling the out-of-memory
(OOM) killer and reading its status.  Its presence enables the creation of
user-space OOM killers.  The new API provides some of this functionality
via the <tt>memory.events</tt> knob, but does not give a way to disable the
OOM killer.  The version&nbsp;2 <tt>memory.high</tt> knob (<a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files">documented
here</a>) can be used to similar effect, though perhaps less reliably.
Johannes Weiner said that Meta is using it that way, and it works;
evidently Android also uses <tt>memory.high</tt> for this purpose.
<p>
Hocko said that the <tt>oom_control</tt> knob has been broken for years.
It only controls OOM handling in the page-fault path.  It is not
a big deal to support, he said, since the overhead is small, but nothing
like it should be provided in the version&nbsp;2 API.  There <i>is</i> a
need for better control over the OOM killer, he said; perhaps
that could be provided as a hook for a BPF program.  That approach would
allow controlling the OOM killer globally as well.
<p>
The next version 1 feature considered was memory-pressure notifications.
This feature is not reliable, it assumes that there is reclaimable memory,
which might not be the case.  Unfortunately, the network-memory-pressure
notification has leaked into the version&nbsp;2 interface.  The <a
href="/Articles/759781/">pressure-stall information API</a> is sufficient
for most use cases, but there does need to be an alternative for
network-memory pressure in particular.
<p>
Toward the end of the session, attention turned to the combined accounting
of memory and swap usage.  This feature has been an area of concern for
some time; it was <a href="/Articles/753162/">discussed</a> at the 2018
summit.  Google is still using this feature, though, and there does not
seem to be a way to create a good replacement.  Hocko said that he hoped
Google would eventually move to the version&nbsp;2 interface for the "great
features" it provides, and will find a way to move to a newer swap model in
the process.  There was a suggestion for a "<tt>-google</tt>" mount option
for the cgroupfs filesystem
to make this feature appear in version&nbsp;2, but Hocko said that would
cause it to never go away.
<p>
The final knob discussed was <tt>swappiness</tt>, which controls the
relative attention paid by the reclaim mechanism to anonymous and
file-backed pages.  Hocko said that users complain that the knob doesn't
work; it can be changed, but the changes do not propagate through the
control-group hierarchy, creating confusion.  He would rather not see that
confusion repeated in the version&nbsp;2 interface.  Weiner disagreed,
though, saying that it is possible to define good hierarchical semantics
for <tt>swappiness</tt>.  Before proceeding, though, it will be necessary
to define the use cases for this knob.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

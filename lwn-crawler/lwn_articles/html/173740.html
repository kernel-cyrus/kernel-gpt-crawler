<h1>ABI stability documentation</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted February 28, 2006 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Last week's Kernel Page <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/172986/">looked at
the stability of the user-space interface</a>, especially regarding areas
like sysfs, which are not always regarded as being part of the kernel ABI.
This week, Greg Kroah-Hartman has made an attempt to make the issue more
evident through <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/173661/">a set of ABI
stability documents</a>.  Included in his patch is a proposal for a
different way of looking at ABI stability issues.
<p>

Linus has, in the recent past, <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/172989/">taken a hard line</a> on changes
interfaces to user-space:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If you cannot maintain a stable kernel interface, then you damn
	well should not send your patches in for inclusion in the standard
	kernel. Keep your own "HAL-unstable" kernel and ask people to test
	it there.
	<p>
	It really is that easy. Once a system call or other kernel
	interface goes into the standard kernel, it stays that way. It
	doesn't get switched around to break user space.
</div>
<p>
Greg, has, instead, taken the approach that not all kernel interfaces
should be seen as stable from the outset.  So he has proposed five
different classifications for ABI stability:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Stable</b>.  Interfaces classified as stable will not break "for at 
     least two years," and probably quite a bit longer.  The Linux system
     call interface is classified in this way.
<p>
<li> <b>Testing</b>.  A "testing" interface is one which has been through
     most of the development process.  It is not expected to change, but,
     that notwithstanding, the possibility of an incompatible change before
     the interface becomes "stable" does exist. This is the time for
     user-space programs to begin to make real use of the interface, but
     user-space developers need to pay attention to what is happening on
     the kernel side.  The sysfs files under <tt>/sys/class</tt> have been
     designated as having a "testing" level of stability by Greg's
     documentation.
<p>
<li> <b>Unstable</b>.  This classification is for relatively new interfaces
     which are expected to change as problems in the initial implementation
     become clear.  Sysfs files under <tt>/sys/devices</tt> are classified
     as "unstable."
<p>
<li> <b>Private</b>.  This class describes interfaces which are intended to
     be hidden behind a user-space library and which should not be used
     directly by applications.  The ALSA sound system is an example of a
     "private" interface.
<p>
<li> <b>Obsolete</b> marks interfaces which are destined to be removed, and
     which should not be used at all.  Few long-timer observers will be
     surprised to see that Greg marked devfs as being obsolete.
</ul>
<p>

Linus <a href="/Articles/173757/">doesn't like the unstable and private
classifications</a>, calling them "excuses for bad habits."  But it is true
that inclusion in the mainline can stress an interface in surprising ways,
leading to a need for changes.  Interface design is hard, even if you don't
have to get everything right the first time.  So it may make some sense to
allow unstable interfaces into the kernel for a short while - as long as
they are clearly documented as such.  Thus far, there has been no way to
warn developers that a certain interface, perhaps, shouldn't be relied upon
quite yet. 
<p>
The notion of private interfaces looks harder to justify.  There has been
some talk of shipping user-space libraries for private interfaces with the
kernel, just to help ensure that the whole package provides a stable
application interface for any release.  That seems like a fairly unlikely
change, however, at least for big interfaces like ALSA.

<p>
Changes will likely be made (this scheme might be classified "unstable" at
this point), but it seems probable that it will, in some form, be adopted.
That can only be a good thing for people interested in a stable user-space
interface; once the expectations have been reasonably well documented,
it will be easier to live up to them.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      It might be useful to define HOW an interface could change but still work with older applications.<br>
<p>
Eg: /proc/self/stat - new numbers are to be added to the end of the line.<br>
<p>
This might seem natural, but for this to work applications need to be aware that this might happen -- ie ignore anything beyond what they expect.<br>
<p>
This strategy will not always work, but it might help prolong the life of some interfaces, ie not break old code.<br>

      <p>Sometimes, it's wise to split up a function between kernel and user 
space, think for example the TCP in userspace experiment. The kernel 
quickly pushing packets to the userspace TCP library allows a much faster 
implementation than a in-kernel TCP stack, and at the same time, 
development gets easier (most of the stuff is in user space, anyway). 
These splits need a kernel interface, but there's no point to encourage 
usage of this interface. The application should use TCP, not the weird 
kernel interface.</p> 
 
<p>So in these cases, the kernel boundary is <b>not</b> an interface, but 
just an arbitrary boundary in one program that exists on both sides (in 
the user space library and in the kernel). This is a micro-kernel view of 
things, because in a micro-kernel world, no application programmer in his 
right mind would use the micro-kernel functionality directly, but 
user-space libraries. Linus might not like micro-kernels, but it has been 
demonstrated that micro-kernel-like approaches can make parts of the 
kernel faster. In this case, the "private" interface is not bad 
practice.</p>

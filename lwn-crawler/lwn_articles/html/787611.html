Shakeel Butt started his 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit session by noting that memory makes up a big part
of the total cost of equipping a data center.  As a result, data-center
operators try to make the best use of memory they can, generally
overcommitting it significantly.  In this session, Butt described a scheme
in use at Google to try to improve memory utilization; while the need for
the described functionality was generally agreed upon, the developers in
the room were not entirely happy with the solution presented.
<p>
Overcommitting memory increases total utilization, but it comes at a cost:
systems experience memory pressure and end up having to reclaim pages.
Direct reclaim (where a process that is allocating memory has to do some of
the work of freeing up memory used by others) is particularly problematic
since it can introduce surprising delays; it reduces the isolation between
users.  The solution to this problem, he said, is to seek out and reclaim
idle pages before memory gets tight.
<p>
To this end, systems in the data center have been supplemented with slower
(cheaper) memory, which can take any of a number of forms, including
persistent memory, in-memory compression, or a real swap device.  The
system manages this memory in a way that is transparent to users.  Then, idle

<a href="/Articles/787612/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/ShakeelButt-sm.jpg" alt="[Shakeel Butt]"
title="Shakeel Butt" class="lthumb"></a>

memory (pages that have not been accessed for some time) are located and
pushed out to this slower memory.  Butt said that, across the Google data
center, about 32% of memory can be deemed to be idle at any given time.  If
that memory is reclaimed after two minutes of idle time, he said, about 14%
of it will be refaulted back in; the rest is better used by somebody else.
<p>
At this point, one might wonder why Google doesn't just use the kernel's
existing reclaim mechanism, as implemented by the <tt>kswapd</tt> kernel
thread.  It "kind of works", he said, but is based on watermarks (keeping a
certain percentage of memory free) rather than on idleness.
<tt>kswapd</tt> also tries to balance memory usage across NUMA nodes, which
is not useful in this setting.  Finally, Butt said, <tt>kswapd</tt> is
built on a large set of complicated heuristics, and he doesn't want to try
to change them.
<p>
So, instead, Google has put resources into a mechanism for tracking idle
pages.  There is a system in place now that is based on a user-space
process that reads a bitmap
stored in sysfs, but it has a high CPU and memory overhead, so a new
approach is being tried.  It is built on a new kernel thread called
<tt>kstaled</tt>; it tracks idle pages using page flags, so it no longer
adds memory overhead to the system, but it still requires a relatively
large amount of CPU time.  The new <tt>kreclaimd</tt> thread then scans
through memory, reclaiming pages that have been idle for too long.
<p>
The CPU cost is not trivial; it increases linearly with the amount of
memory that must be tracked and with the scan frequency.  On a system with
512GB of installed memory, one full CPU must be dedicated to this task.
Most of this time is spent walking through the reverse-map entries to find
page mappings.  This has been improved by getting rid of the reverse-map
walk and creating a linked list of mid-level (PMD) page tables; that
reduced CPU usage by a factor of&nbsp;3.5.  Removing the scanning from
<tt>kreclaimd</tt> in favor of a queue of pages passed in from
<tt>kstaled</tt> gave another significant reduction.
<p>
Butt said that he would like to upstream this work; it is not something
that can be handled in user space.  Rik van Riel noted that, even with the
performance improvements that have been made, this system has scalability
problems.  Johannes Weiner asked why Google was reimplementing the tracking
that is already done by the memory-management subsystem's
least-recently-used (LRU) lists.  Like the LRUs, this new mechanism is
trying to predict the future use of pages; it might be nice to have, he
said, but it is "crazy expensive".  Butt replied that Google was willing to
pay that cost, which was less than having the system go into direct
reclaim.
<p>
Weiner continued, saying that Facebook has faced the same issue.  There,
every workload must be containerized, and users are required to declare how
much memory they will need.  But nobody actually knows how much memory
their task will require, so they all ask for too much, leading to the need
to overcommit and reclaim issues.  The solution being tried there is to use
<a href="/Articles/759781/">pressure-stall information</a> to learn when
memory is starting to get tight, then chopping the oldest pages off the LRU
list.  If the refault rate goes up, pages are reclaimed less aggressively.
This solution, he said, yields reasonable results at a much smaller CPU
cost.
<p>
Discussion continued for a bit, but the general consensus was that, while
this sort of proactive reclaim would be useful for a number of users, the
cost of this particular solution was too high to consider merging it
upstream.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This sounds like the existing swap-prefetch mechanism, but in reverse.<br>
<p>
Since that wasn't mentioned I'll have to ask: couldn't they just make the prefetching bidirectional? Idle pages at the tail of the LRU list would get copied to swap but remain live for as long as possible. Ideally the swap space would float near 100% full, so that by the time reclaim under pressure has to happen little to no IO is needed.<br>

(CW: tangent + entertaining bad idea)<br>
<p>
I kinda wish the kernel would always actively move anonymous pages to swap if they get used less often than cache/buffer. Then--bear with me here--if the system still gets full, instead of killing processes directly, the kernel should "forget" just enough LRU pages out of swap to keep things running smoothly. Behavior would be controlled with the same /proc/$pid/oom_* knobs everyone already ignores. ;-) A process owning forgotten pages should keep running, but if it tries to access that page, it gets SIGV. On a long-running system, chances are it's a memory leak, and the process will never even know it's gone.<br>
<p>
You can finally get rid of the 03:25 AM cronjob to restart ${leaky application}, and a class of memory pressure concerns goes away.<br>
<p>
This is a terrible idea. Do not do this.<br>

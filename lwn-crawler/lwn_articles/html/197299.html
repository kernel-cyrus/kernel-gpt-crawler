<h1>An API for specifying latency constraints</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted August 28, 2006 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Modern processors support a number of power states.  When there is
nothing of any real interest going on, they can be instructed to power down
to one of potentially several different levels.  Since processors on most
systems are idle much of the time, this capability can be put to use to
bring about a significant reduction in power use.  Cutting power demand is
most helpful on systems with limited power sources - laptops, portable
music players, Linux-powered penguin robots, etc. - but cutting power
consumption is also a good thing to do in most other environments as well.
<p>
Powering down the CPU becomes an even more useful thing to do once a
dynamic tick mechanism is in use - something which appears possible for the
Linux i386 port in 2.6.19.  The elimination of the periodic clock
interrupt will allow the processor to sleep for longer periods of time when
there is nothing to do.  Longer sleeps can translate into deeper power
saving modes, reducing consumption even further.
<p>

The problem that can come up, however, is that the more aggressive power
management modes will, by their nature, cause the processor to take longer
to get back into an operating state.  So, as the processor is put more
deeply to rest, the system's latency in responding to external events will
increase.  In some situations, that latency can cause the system to fail to
operate properly.  Audio or video data might get dropped, a network adapter
may start to see errors, or that robotic penguin could fail to respond in
time to a cyber-walrus threat.  The usual response to that problem, beyond
hunting walruses to extinction, is to simply disable the power-saving
behavior.  but such drastic responses should not really be necessary.
<p>

Various devices in the system, when operating in certain modes, will need
to obtain responses from the  system
within a given period of time.  The drivers for those devices
know how the device is being operated at any given moment, so they know what
the latency requirements are.  If the system as a whole had that
information, it could tune its operations to the minimum latency
requirements in effect at the moment, and could change its operations as
the requirements change.  But there is no mechanism in the system for
handling - and reacting to - this information.
<p>

Arjan van de Ven has set out to change this situation with a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/197282/">latency tracking infrastructure</a>
patch.  This work adds a set of new functions which may be used by drivers
to indicate their latency requirements:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/latency.h&gt;

    void set_acceptable_latency(char *identifier, int usecs);
    void modify_acceptable_latency(char *identifier, int usecs);
    void remove_acceptable_latency(char *identifier);
</pre>
<p>
When a driver enters a mode where it has specific latency requirements (a
camera driver starts acquiring frame data, say), it can tell the system
about the maximum latency it can handle with
<tt>set_acceptable_latency()</tt>.  The <tt>identifier</tt> parameter is
only used for identifying the request later on; <tt>usecs</tt> is the
maximum latency in microseconds.  The latency requirement can be changed
with <tt>modify_acceptable_latency()</tt>, or eliminated altogether with
<tt>remove_acceptable_latency()</tt>.  
<p>
The back end of the latency infrastructure includes a notifier chain for
letting interested subsystems know when the maximum acceptable latency has
changed.  The current consumer of this information is the ACPI subsystem,
which can use it to adjust the processor's idle state to meet that
requirement.  One could imagine that a smart dynamic tick implementation
could use this information as well.
<p>

In the current patch, only one subsystem (the IPW2100 wireless network
driver) declares its latency requirements.  This version of the patch has
been proposed for inclusion in the -mm kernel, however, with the idea that
other driver maintainers could start to make use of it.  Unless some sort
of surprising objection comes up, the latency management infrastructure
looks likely to be a part of the 2.6.19 kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      This kind of response to things just can't be beat.  No doubt commercial OS vendors (Sun, Microsoft) could act this fast internally, but then it would be ages before it hit the customers and before the new API got some traction with other developers.  Even the old kernel dev model, with even numbers = stable and odd numbers = dev, weren't as fast.  There are a few hiccups with this fast release cycle, but they are pretty minor overall, and it constantly amazes me how well the kernel team handles this new dev cycle.<br>

      Absolutely. I still hear people very external to the Linux community <br>
gripe about the 2.6 process from time to time (leaving me to wonder why <br>
they care since they're not users). Being on LKML, it's damn easy to <br>
notice just how effective 2.6 really is. With 2.6, everyone wins - users, <br>
distributors and developers.<br>

      I wonder how this can be transitioned in.  It seems to me that any driver that doesn't declare its latency requirement must be assumed to need the minimum possible latency.  The result is that the last driver to be updated holds up implementing power-down.  It's not as bad as it might be, as lots of drivers aren't even open much of the time, and most of us won't have the hardware they drive, but I wonder how we will know which driver is keeping our own machine from sleeping.<br>
<p>
The problem seems similar to discovering which daemon is keeping the disk from ever spinning down.<br>

      Actually it's sort of the other way around. Right now, the power savings already happen, including the latency hit. It's just that these are right now blind to the actual requirements, and assume everything goes.<br>
<p>
With this patch drivers and subsystems can put a brake on that behavior basically (which also means the power savings can be more agressive since they're less likely to run into bad behavior, but that's for a bit later).<br>
<p>
Also, the good news is that for ALSA at least, the latency can be calculated in the subsystem; eg there is no need to adjust all sound drivers, just a few lines of code in the subsystem are enough... (the alsa patch is going to Andrew Morton today).<br>

      I like this a lot.<br>
<p>
However, I'd like to see something similar exposed to user space, since applications may also have latency requirements. This is especially true in consumer devices, where a lot of essential and relatively low-level functionality is likely to be built as user-space applications rather than as drivers.<br>

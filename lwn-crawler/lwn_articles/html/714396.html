<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 15, 2017</br>
           </div>
The 4.10 merge window included the addition of <a
href="/Articles/698073/">the ability to attach a BPF 
program</a> to a control group; that program could then filter network packets
for all processes within the group.  In January, <a
href="/Articles/711234/">concerns were raised</a> about several aspects of
the API for this feature.  As the final 4.10 release approaches, it would
seem that a last-minute solution for at least one of these concerns has
been reached.
<P>
One of the strongest worries raised in January had to do with how
filter programs at multiple levels of the control-group hierarchy interact.
Consider a simple hierarchy like that shown to the right; group&nbsp;A is

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/cg-hier.png" width=154 height=104
alt="[Control-group hierarchy]" hspace=3 vspace=3 border=0
align="right">

at the top level, while groups&nbsp;B and&nbsp;C are contained within it.
What happens to a process contained within B if filter programs are
attached at both A&nbsp;and&nbsp;B?  In the original implementation, only
the program attached at the lower level&nbsp;(B) would be run.  As a
result, any process that had the ability to attach a program to&nbsp;B
would be able to override any restrictions imposed at higher levels of the
hierarchy. 
In some settings, that may be desirable behavior but, in others, it could
be a security issue.
<p>
This is an important detail to get right from the outset; if programs come
to rely on the behavior described above, it may prove impossible to change
in the future without breaking working systems.  So there was a certain
amount of back-and-forth over 
whether this behavior was problematic or not and how urgently it needed to
be changed.  Then things went quiet for a while, and it appeared that 4.10
would ship with this behavior.  And, indeed, that might have happened if
4.10 had, as most had expected, been released on February&nbsp;12.
<p>
A few days before that date, Alexei Starovoitov posted <a
href="/Articles/714426/">a patch</a> aimed at addressing the objections to
the 4.10 behavior.  It modifies the <tt>bpf()</tt> system call used to
attach a filter program to a control group, adding a new flag called
<tt>BPF_F_ALLOW_OVERRIDE</tt>.  If the flag is present when a filter program is
installed, a process attached to a lower control group will be able to
override that program by attaching a new program at a lower level.  So, if
a filter program is attached to group&nbsp;A above with this flag set, it will be
possible to override that program in groups&nbsp;B and&nbsp;C by attaching
new filter programs there.  If the flag is absent, instead, it will not be
possible to attach programs to those lower groups at all.
<p>
The <tt>BPF_F_ALLOW_OVERRIDE</tt> flag, in other words, implements the
current 4.10 semantics for the groups below the group where a program is
attached.  The flag is not set by default, though, so the default behavior
has changed to prevent a program from being overridden in this way.  That
gives system administrators control over how this behavior is handled while
defaulting to a more secure mode and preventing code from relying on the
unconditional ability to override packet-filter programs on control groups.
<p>
In response to the original patch, Andy Lutomirski, who raised most of the
concerns about the original interface, <a
href="/Articles/714428/">suggested</a> one change: if the filter program installed
at&nbsp;A sets <tt>BPF_F_ALLOW_OVERRIDE</tt>, any programs installed lower
in the hierarchy should be required to have that flag set as well.  That
restriction will avoid potential confusion if, at some future date, the
ability to stack BPF programs at multiple levels (so that the filters at
all levels of the hierarchy run, rather than just the lowest one) is
added.  Starovoitov agreed, and promptly posted <a
href="/Articles/714395/">a new version</a> with that additional restriction
added.
<p>
At this point, everybody involved appears to be happy with the patch, and
there is general agreement that it should be merged before 4.10 is
released.  That has not happened as of this writing, but there would appear
to be no fundamental roadblock that would prevent it from happening before
February&nbsp;19, when the final 4.10 release will almost certainly
happen.  So it would appear that this story, which included some moderately
acrimonious debate, has come to a reasonably happy conclusion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 26, 2018</br>
           </div>
The dust has begun to settle after the abrupt decisions by Linus Torvalds
to take a break from kernel maintainership and to adopt a code of conduct
for the community as a whole.  Unsurprisingly, the development community,
most of which was not consulted prior to the adoption of this code, has a
lot of questions about it and a number of concerns.  While many of the
answers to those questions will be a while in coming, a few things are
beginning to come into focus.
<p>
It is worth starting with one important point that <a
href="/Articles/765108/">last week's article</a> failed to mention: the new
code of conduct is not actually new to the community as a whole.  In
particular, the DRM (graphics) subsystem <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8676df503092dcdd757b1120fab03bfbce0ae1e7">adopted</a>
the <a
href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/CodeOfConduct/">freedesktop.org code
of conduct</a> in April 2017.  This code, like the code for the kernel as a
whole, is derived from the Contributor Covenant text.  There have not been
any problems of note arising from the use of this code in that subsystem to
date.  Your editor has been told that the DRM community's successful use of
this code 
was a direct contributor to Torvalds's choice of this particular code as a
starting point for the kernel.
<p>
One area of concern in the public discussion has been over the prohibition
of the posting of "private information", explicitly including email
addresses.  Some maintainers read that as a prohibition against including
tags in patches, most of which contain such addresses.  Some, like
Signed-off-by or Reviewed-by, are provided by the person involved and
should be relatively uncontroversial.  Others, like Cc or Reported-by, are
likely to be added by a developer or maintainer.  Unsurprisingly,
maintainers do not like the idea of unwittingly violating the code simply
by doing their jobs.  Mauro Carvalho Chehab has <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20180918162948.769dda1d@coco.lan/">argued this
point</a>, saying: "<q>We should solve this quickly, as otherwise maintainers may need to postpone
asking for pulling from any branches on trees that contain patches with
such tags</q>".


<p>
Those who have looked at the issue seem to be under the impression that, by
posting an email to a public list, one has "published" one's own email
address and it is no longer private information.  This appears to be true
even under some of the stricter privacy legislation found around the
world.  So the use of these addresses in patch tags would not appear to be
problematic.  Still, the prohibition as expressed in the code appears to be
better suited to projects using online hosting sites rather than email for
their patch flow.  At some point, it would probably make sense to
amend the code to clarify the intended rules.
<p>
Another area of concern is that the code places the responsibility for
enforcement on all maintainers.  There are now numerous kernel maintainers
who never asked for this responsibility, and who lack a clear idea of what
they are actually responsible for.  As Shuah Khan <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/cf7638b9-c25d-d47e-f539-192a43268122@kernel.org/">put
it</a>: "<q>I have to not only worry about the quality of code and
technical aspects, but also be responsible for behavior of individuals I
might not have any control or sway over</q>".  Khan is not alone in
wondering what this requirement actually means for maintainership going
forward.
<p>
Those questions will be harder to answer.  In a community as large as the
kernel, the responsibility for enforcing the rules must necessarily be
distributed across the maintainers.  It is not up to one person (or some
sort of elected board) to ensure that patches live up to the coding style
rules or have proper signoffs.  The same will have to be true for the
kernel's conduct standards.  But if the responsibility for calling out
abusive behavior lies solely on the shoulders of the maintainers, it is
easy to predict that maintainer turnover will increase in the future.  If
the community truly wants to be a more welcoming place, it will have to be
up to all members to encourage each other toward better behavior when it is
needed.
<p>
In truth, that encouragement is all that is needed a great deal of the
time, and anybody can do it.  If the more repressive measures envisioned in
the code of conduct are invoked with any sort of frequency, something will
have gone badly wrong.  With any luck at all, most maintainers will never
see anything requiring more than an admonition and a request for more
attention in the future.  For those who do run into something worse, the
project as a whole will need to provide resources and support.  Consulting
with the Technical Advisory Board is one such resource, but it is likely to
be insufficient.
<p>
There have been some suggestions for changes to the code of conduct
already, and more are sure to come.  The code is almost certain to
evolve to better fit the kernel community, but the process by which that
evolution can happen has not been worked out — or even thought about much.
Future changes will require discussion and widespread acceptance; they
cannot just be applied like the current code was.
<p>
In summary, there are a lot of questions, and many of the answers have yet
to be worked out.  Getting there will take some time.  It seems likely that
there will be significant discussion of the topic at the Maintainers Summit
in October, but there may not be many hard answers coming from there.
After 27 years, we still haven't finished bashing the kernel into shape;
the code of conduct and its associated processes should come together
rather more quickly than that, but some patience may still be required.
<p>
Finally, it is worth being aware of the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD)
attacks against the kernel community that the code has brought about.  Some
developers feel better about the code than others at this point, but their
concerns are expressed in a rather different manner than the various
trolling messages that have appeared on linux-kernel, and which have
seemingly been taken seriously by the mainstream press.  We are <i>not</i>
in that much trouble, and we do not, for example, have actual developers
asserting a hypothetical right to revoke the GPL licensing from their
contributions.
<p>
Reading some of those emails (not to mention some of the unpleasant stuff
found on the wider Internet), it's hard not to feel that our community is
under attack from the outside.  Hopefully those people will soon get bored
and go back to trying to stir up trouble elsewhere.  To the extent that we
can encourage their departure by not responding to obvious trolling emails,
the better off we will be.  As a community, we are far stronger than those
who would seek to tear us apart.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Personally, I don't see why I (for example) should have any stake in the code of conduct, as a user-but-not-developer of Linux, other than perhaps on three points:<br>
<p>
(1) if I'm a potential developer, it may well impact whether I become a developer in reality,<br>
<p>
(2) if I think it will have a significant impact on the software itself (which is fairly unlikely - there are projects with smaller contributor bases where the community has completely split in two and yet the code base has survived and even flourished) or<br>
<p>
(3) if there are serious ethical or reputational considerations (does it go against my or my culture's norms to the extent I don't wish to be associated with or support it in any way?)<br>
<p>
I think a code of conduct would have to be pretty unusual to trigger (2) or (3) for most people.<br>

To answer your question from my perspective but others most likely interpet it differently<br>
<p>
All rules/guidelines are only applicable within that specific community so users will have to partake or engage in someform with that community to have any weight on the matter or fall under it's community rules or guidelines.<br>
<p>
So if you as an user are in some form of active engagement with an community like some communication with the community ( through some of the communities official communication channels ) then you have effectively become a member of said community since you are providing ( contributing ) positive or negative feedback into it's environment.<br>
<p>
So to put this into perspective.<br>
<p>
if an user is sharing his opinion in some random corner on the internet or over coffee with his or her best friend he has no weight in the matter but if the user shares it with the community through any of it's community channels, the user has some weight in the matter since the user is engaging with the community thus has become it's member.<br>

I think that users' concerns should not have any weight in this. Yes, if I as a user want to submit a bug report or something like that I will have to follow the guidelines. But in my opinion, the CoC is there not only to "protect" the developers from other developers but also from the users. As they are not the ones protected by it they should not have a say in this.<br>
<p>
This is my personal opinion, you are free to disagree.<br>

While it is important to define our terms, I wonder if taking a narrow view of who can be community member is a good idea. Why limit who can participate? Isn’t one of the prime motivators for the Code of Conduct to be more inclusive?<br>
<p>
I believe a good code of conduct has more to do with common human desires and social norms, for example, respect. Explicitly excluding people, while a very human reaction, may not be the best course of action.<br>

      I'm still not understanding why this particular CoC was chosen and not, say, the <a href="https://www.debian.org/code_of_conduct">Debian CoC</a>. That would have been far less contentious IMO. Maybe there's still a chance to get such a CoC adopted instead.

The latter, though not in an as absolute way, as you make it sound here. If some, even important, subsystem does something, than that's one thing, yet still pretty contained and doesn't affect the project at large. For the overarching project I would have wished for a CoC which is short, general, focuses on the few intentions it is supposed to ensure and is as free as it can be from political "baggage".<br>
<p>
NB: If I wanted to, I could feel offended by your comment, since one possible way to read it, is, that you're suggesting a severe lack of reading comprehension on my part. Now, if I apply the Debian CoC this problem goes away since I will then assume good faith and assume you might not have worded this perfectly. Under the CoC adopted by the kernel I could call this an "insulting comment".<br>
<p>
I will apply the Debian CoC and say, that my original comment could have been more explicit in this regard. Even though the latter way of reading my comment might be the more obvious one, if one assumes, that I actually read the article I commented on (ie. if one assumes good faith).<br>

The reason why your first comment was ambiguous is that it didn't explain why you still had doubt (i.e why one should prefer the Debian CoC to the DRM one). Your second comment fixes that.<br>
<p>
Said crudely, your first comment looked like a troll whereas your second looks like an argument.<br>
<p>
As for why, I'd be tempted to say the NIH syndrome probably played a bit: Linus (and other people involved in the decision) are more familiar with the DRM folks than with the Debian's one. They had direct feedback on this CoC, not on the others. Not all decisions are necessarily rational ...<br>

This raise the question... <br>
<p>
Is it not a bad thing if each sub-community has it's own set of rules/guidelines which may or may not exist in the parent community or may lead to contradiction ( or exemption ) to an existing one in the parent community which can lead to confusion ( similar to the inherent mess that the state laws are in the states )?<br>

Like we already have had for years. The rules for getting patches into each subsystem is different, the rules for filing bugs with each subsystem is different. We'd like to try and get those things consolidated as well, but there are still outliers in all areas. The CoC isn't special here.<br>

They have acted, we have a CoC now. One subsystem had one, and now they all have it.<br>
<p>
If you mean around other rules, well we have got coding standards and other rules we expect. Linus wrote git but not every subsystem maintainer uses it (akpm) and not every subsystem maintainer uses it consistently. Unilateral action is hard, but in some cases makes sense and can be done.<br>

It's not limited to rules or guidelines what I was referring to. <br>

Fragmentation in whole is bad so you dont want to have guidelines/rules/coding standards/documentation/bug trackers etc per sub-community and scattered across the internet because then for example you start waisting current and potential contributors time.

The DRM subsystem is part of both the kernel and graphics communities. It's too simplistic to say deviating from some kernel rules or tools is automatically bad fragmentation. From the graphics community perspective there's plenty of synergy in using common freedesktop.org infrastructure; that's where our git repositories, mailing lists, bug trackers, etc. are hosted. For example, it's much more common to reassign bugs between graphics kernel and userspace than between graphics and the rest of the kernel. Many developers work in both spaces. Arguably the graphics community could not afford the fragmentation imposed by a split between kernel and userspace communities.<br>
<p>
Due to the freedesktop.org infrastructure the DRM subsystem was de facto operating under the freedesktop.org code of conduct anyway, so formalizing it in DRM subsystem documentation was a natural progression. (And even so, more than two dozen acks by maintainers and developers were sought before committing.)<br>

Fragmentation is bad; one size doesn't always fits all either. The kernel is big. Different (mandatory) coding standards for different components does waste time, whereas different bug trackers does not much and it can have some benefits.<br>

You can achive the point you are making without having to fragment but using multiple systems to maintain the origin comes at higher time cost due to the added complexity it brings.<br>
<p>
If we use bug trackers as an example you need a single bug tracker as an origin and that bug tracker can have as many other bug trackers as can be imagine for as long as those bug trackers perform bi-directional communication amongst themselves to maintain that origin. <br>
<p>
For example if an report is created in bug tracker at point of origin it will also be created at  all or just the relevant sub-community bug tracker instance ( depending how this is setup ), any creation, state change,comment etc from the bug tracker at sub-community will also create,update etc report at the origin ( or pull/push model like used in dvs could be used ) . <br>
<p>
The above is not fragmentation. <br>
<p>
Fragmentation occures when there exist no bi-directional communication between bug trackers so if an report is created at origin the reporter is directed somewhere else to another bug tracker to create report there. <br>
<p>
In addition to that, fragmentation exist in most peoples perception of time ( often used as false justification for having seperated instances from the origin, like seperated bug trackers ), in which it manifests itself by people putting more value on their time compared to others ( often via roles like developer vs reporter or doctor vs nurse etc which creates even further fragmentation and inevitable conflict ) when in fact we ( as in the entire human race ) are bound by the same amount of time, defined by the average lifespan of an human being. <br>

- I've seen a number of bug tracker "bridges" in operation and heard of a few more. They were all mostly dysfunctional and universally hated. A well designed schema for a bug database models closely the workflows of the corresponding team. Different teams work differently and bridging different schemas leaves users constantly wondering what exact  information does the bridge lose and under which conditions.<br>
<p>
- I can hardly see any value anyway in a unique bug tracker for the kernel - which again is a huge collection of many different projects. Why would the developers of some wifi driver care about bugs in some other random audio driver? Why would have to constantly filter out noise from other components? Why would they have to restrict themselves to a common and minimal schema? Why would they have to deal with the significantly higher administration complexity, work and permissions?<br>

Through my life I have come across my share of various bug trackers and worked maintaining one for several years, which hosted over 1000 projects of mixed match of being software projects to request tracker, literally creating, and tailoring workflows to individual company and government structure,their departments, different teams to make those companies more efficent,meet their sla, generate reports etc.<br>
<p>
I have seen unimaginable horror in this regard so much horror that I propably should make freedesktop.org my next draining the type ocean project and contribute to it's migration/restoration ( that is if it will ever get over it's identity crisis ) ;) <br>

Anyway I understand the pain you are getting at but what you describe here is failure of the tool and or those that are administrating it, which is the cause of the fragmentation so simply switch out bugzilla for something better. . .<br>

Bugzilla is practically inexistent in the experience I described.<br>

The tracker software certainly plays a role but not the most important role in my experience. How you configure and use it matters much more. it's a bit like programming languages: you can write bad code in any of them. It's just easier with some.<br>

If bugzilla aint that bad then there is no excuse for kernel and all it's sub-communities not using it but I personally dont recommend it. Today's requirements are so much more then an simple bug tracker.<br>

<p>
True, but there is a simple way to fix this: have the global Linux C.o.C. take precedence whenever there is a conflict.  Ideally, the global C.o.C. would set some ground rules, and then the communities could expand on or clarify if necessary.<br>
<p>
(Because you mention federal vs. state law: the above is basically the way the legal system is set up in Germany -- the German constitution says that when both federal and state law are applicable but contradictory, federal law wins.) <br>

The cases where the CoC could have been invoked, for example, during the last six months are very few.<br>
What I am reading from the discussion on LKML is that some people consider it would be a daily concern.<br>
<p>
The purpose of the CoC is that if bad behavior is during the development of the kernel, there is a process to take care of it and people would not have to deal with it. That you would view the unfortunate bad behavior but you would be confident it will be dealt with. <br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Still, the prohibition as expressed in the code appears to be better suited to projects using online hosting sites rather than email for their patch flow.</font><br>
<p>
I am wondering how enforcement of the code of conduct could work given the way the Linux kernel works.  As any mail administrator knows, it's not like you can stop people from sending abusive comments (or advertising or anything else) via email.  LKML is a magnet for gigabytes of undesirable content, much of which we never see because it gets eaten by giant spam filters.<br>
<p>
Other projects have central points of failure^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H control where e.g. an abusive user's account can be deactivated.  In Linux, nobody has accounts in the first place, and nobody is interested in changing that.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; if the responsibility for calling out abusive behavior lies solely on the shoulders of the maintainers, it is easy to predict that maintainer turnover will increase in the future</font><br>
<p>
Maintainers can ignore the abusive behavior, ask nicely for the abuse to stop, stop inviting abusers to conventions and social events, or escalate to public authorities.  They most likely do a lot of that already given the aforementioned total absence of accounts and access controls.<br>
<p>
People who run mailing lists, archives, bug trackers, and similar facilities may now be obligated to do extra filtering work.  Anyone who controls access to something like github or kernel.org now has additional justifications for banning abusive people (on top of the usual spam and resource misuse mitigation they already have to implement).  Since there are many more spammers than abusive contributors, the extra workload imposed by the CoC should be negligible there.<br>
<p>
In the extreme, "ignoring abusers" could extend to rejecting patches which, although correct and necessary, are authored or tagged by designated abusive persons.  That's no big deal for patches that have not been pulled (being too abusive tends to prevent that anyway), but if it's applied extremely, literally, and retroactively, it could mean removing reiserfs from the kernel.  That scares people because it's the same problem as with patents--code is not acceptable because of who wrote it, not because of any issue with the code itself.<br>
<p>
While I'm all for removing reiserfs from the kernel, it's because reiserfs is slow and buggy and nobody should be using it for new deployments, not because reiserfs contains code written by at least one known murderer.  I don't expect reiserfs to be removed as a result of the CoC because it was co-written and has been maintained by non-murderers for some years now, and the code is useful and does not promote an ideology (it used to, but that was edited out years ago).<br>
<p>
Statistically, any project with as many contributors as Linux should expect to have patches from 0.9 to 1.8 murderers (depending on distribution of nationality).  What we have now is a document that says their pull requests may be ignored, and maybe their use of the Reviewed-By tag will be ignored, and they may have a slightly harder than average time trying to get attention on mailing lists.<br>
<p>
The CoC means very different things for an abusive contributor (one who submits patches via email and can be simply spambucketed) and an abusive maintainer (one who selects which patches are pulled, and must in turn be selected by a higher-level maintainer, and ultimately transitively accepted by Greg or Linus).  The interior nodes of the maintainer tree are where the impact is most likely to be significant, as that's where the "person is/is-not going to be a contributor today" decision gets made.<br>

<p>
I don't think the problem is with the community at large, but how the maintainers themselves echo the abuse.<br>
<p>
One thing is an irrelevant wannabe developer or a user shouting at the LKML, which will very likely be ignored by all.<br>
<p>
Another completely different thing is maintainers (of any capacity) telling people they should not have been born because of their seemingly "bad code".<br>
<p>
I hate bad code as much as the next guy, but I can understand that the definition is mostly a normalisation process by peer review of trusted developers.<br>
<p>
I have seen *really* bad code in the kernel, done by a top-level maintainer, have complained about and been told it would stay. I didn't need to abuse said developer in any way, and years later, I've been told the code has been cleaned.<br>
<p>
In summary, most of the abuse is done by irrelevant people, which most ignore. But the really harmful abuse is done by relevant developers / maintainers, who have a huge amount of work to do, and little time to know where in the { "think outside the box" - "plain old bs" } spectrum every weird patch is.<br>
<p>
I understand their predicament, I really do. I'm a maintainer myself (LLVM), but I realised speed != haste also when it comes to code review and weeding out bad code. <br>
<p>
Being pragmatic is more constructive and effective than flat out refusing to talk / being abusive to "teach them a lesson". Refusing to accept patches is not nice, but way nicer than being abusive. <br>
<p>
If the CoC manages to fix that problem, however small it has become, it's a win. If it introduces new problems (which some do), then it needs revision.<br>

I will provide a concrete examplet. Here, Linus calls me a "hypocritical bastard with a religious agenda": <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/4/20/83">https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/4/20/83</a><br>

And here, a maintainer repeats it: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/4/20/79">https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/4/20/79</a><br>
<p>
Did it hurt? You bet it did. It still does to this day. Never mind that three years later, the position I had taken which triggered that unseemly ad hominem attack, was proved correct.<br>

Uhhh... you were trying to remove the documentation on how to contribute to the kernel using BitKeeper from the kernel tree *while the kernel still used BitKeeper* and you were surprised that people thought that you had an agenda in doing so? I mean, *obviously* you had one: someone with no agenda wouldn't have tried to do that in the first place.<br>
<p>
The fact that the kernel was eventually forced away from BitKeeper because of precisely the sort of thing you were worried about doesn't mean that trying to remove the documentation about using BitKeeper from the kernel tree while it was still in active use was a sensible way to go about it. You were *trying* to be controversial. Obviously this narked people off, just as you clearly meant it to.<br>

<p>
I notice that you did not call me a "hypocritical bastard" or a "wanker", nor ascribe any particular religion to me. Thank you. Linus and the other respondent could have managed the same, but apparently felt no compunction to do so at the time.<br>
<p>
It is true that I had an agenda, I do not dispute that. I do dispute that my agenda was religious, or anything less than in the best interest of the whole community. My agenda was to prevent the community from splitting down the middle. Sadly, I failed. Linus failed. We all failed, and three years of avoidable disharmony ensued.<br>
<p>
In an alternate universe, Linus accepted my patch, the Bitkeeper documentation was moved out of the kernel source to some web page as I suggested, and we began to build Git in 2002 instead of 2005. You could argue that we did not know how to build Git at the time, and I will argue that we were smart enough to do it even then. Maybe it would not have involved content hashes, who knows. In any case, this would be an appropriate moment to draw attention to the fact that the design of Git is not purely due to Linus. It is in large part due to Graydon Hoare, and partly due to me also, thought I doubt that Linus know that. Graydon does.<br>
<p>
The Bitkeeper fiasco did not come about because of somebody being "controversial". It came about because of the very predictable collision between community and private interests. Not everybody recognized the inevitability of this at the time, but some did. Those voices were shouted down, and should not have been.<br>
<p>
You could argue that my approach was overly dramatic. So how would you have gotten Linus's attention? How would you have done it better? I would like to know. Maybe, with 20-20 hindsight, we could of avoided a further three years of wasteful drama, including the unfortunate departure of respected and valuable contributors.<br>
<p>
One thing you cannot argue is that my post was ill-intentioned. Anyway, thank you for not calling me a "bastard". I would also thank you not to denigrate my contribution to the community in this regard.<br>

In another alternative universe Linux would have tried to use CVS and the just-released newfangled SVN to manage the source code. The strain of maintaining it would have alienated more and more developers, also taking a lot of developer time.<br>
<p>
The continuous developer problems would have caused Linux to stagnate. Eventually companies like the nascent Google lost all the interest in it. By the end of 2004 most of Google servers were migrated to Microsoft Solaris (as Sun was acquired by Microsoft). Unfortunately, that allowed MS to exert significant pressure on Google and prevent them from displacing Microsoft on the Web.<br>
<p>
From that everything else was inevitable. And so by 2020 only one large software company remained in the world, reigning over most of the industry with an iron fist.<br>
<p>
Thank you for ruining the life of a whole alternative universe, you genocidal monster.<br>

I read it. It distinctly lacks any actual alternatives to BK. I was kinda following SVN development at that time (running pre-1.0 builds and all that) and I was looking at other VCSes. There was nothing really competitive with BK for decentralized development.<br>

Well, you've just doomed a whole alternative universe to a life under the totalitarian control of Microsoft. What else can we call you?<br>

Who is "we"? I thought that you are I and the rest of us were "we". Rhetoric such as yours above is a textbook example of the exact opposite of collegial behavior.<br>
<p>
Besides that, the words you attempt to put in my mouth, the analogy you attempt to draw, is wildly wrong. Please go back, read, understand. You missed a lot of the story, did you even read my original post? I doubt you did. And please stop trying to be funny, it is entirely inappropriate in this context. Abuse is often cast in the form of a joke. I didn't get it.<br>
<p>
Perhaps you just need to decompress. My suggestion: go see what happened in the US capitol today. There are parallels.<br>

Yes I have. Why do you assume that people don't read stuff?<br>
<p>
In the original thread you've made a move that was absolutely and utterly disrespectful to core developers, like not even CC-ing Jeff Garzik (the doc author) when submitting their removal patch. Nice touch that. <br>
<p>
So you got disrespect in return. Perfectly understandable.<br>

Fascinating -- haven't we all just now observed a *real-world* example, right here in the comments of LWN, of the sorts of interactions that all of this discussion about the CoC have centered around?<br>
<p>
From my observation of this discussion, I have the following questions:<br>
<p>
  (a) Is it abuse to extrapolate, in response to another poster's alternate history, "ad absurdum" alternate history?<br>
  (b) Is it abuse if, in doing so, one off-handedly refers to the other poster as a "genocidal monster", and expecting the context of an obvious, but not explicitly stated "ad absurdum" comment to excuse the insult as good humor?<br>
  (c) Is it abuse if, in such an exchange, one poster feigns to not understand such a context in order to render the other's comment as abuse? Did such feigning just occur, or was there a genuine misunderstanding of intent (possibly on my own part)?<br>
  (d) Is it abuse to repeatedly imply that the other has not read your comment, when a more generous interpretation would assume that they were responding to it?<br>
<p>
After all the discussion had on the CoC -- I'd really love to see how the principles aspired to can be applied to this exchange?<br>

      Daniel, the post was really just an amusing way of saying "we can't really know what would have happened had the kernel community not gone with BK".  It was not meant, as far as I can tell, to be abusive in any way; surely you don't think anybody is really calling you a "genocidal monster"?  The OP was just having fun running a fantasy to an extreme conclusion.

For what it's worth, I think a lot of the language quoted from Linus and others was often intended that way.<br>
<p>
When people are angry they sometimes go over the top in an odd attempt to soften the blow by taking it to the point of silliness.  But that often backfires.<br>
<p>
I think as a rule if you're angry or arguing with someone, it's better not to be insulting, even as a joke.  They're probably not in a mood to get the joke.<br>
<p>
This is an odd case, though, as it seemed so obviously silly from the start.<br>

FWIW I would definitely have done nothing because my reaction to social conflict is to run away. (I'm not saying *this* would have been the right thing to do, either, but it would have had the same net effect on the path of future events, i.e. none to speak of.)<br>

Well, I don't want to write a book about it right here and now. Most interested observers know that Linus got the idea of content hashing and other important ideas from Monotone:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/6/121">https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/6/121</a><br>
<p>
The main problem with Monotone was performance. Linus knew what to do about that. Monotone was the brainchild of Graydon Hoare. Incidentally, so is Rust. Quite the prolific, largely unsung inventor.<br>
<p>
I knew Graydon from my time at Red Hat, where we both worked for Red Hat and met from time to time in the Toronto offices of the former Cygnus. Around that time, I was also casting around for a good design model for a distributed revision control system, as an alternative to Bitkeeper. I found Monotone, some months before the drama unfolded resulting in Linus's post above. Then, Monotone had no concept of directories, it only had a flat forest of objects with each content-hashed object indexed under the full path name.<br>
<p>
One day in some dim hallway, possibly at Red Hat headquarters during a conference, I buttonholed Graydon and launched into a polemic about what I thought needed to be done to Monotone to make it truly useful. That was basically, elaborate the metadata design so that directories are objects too. Graydon initially found the idea offensive compared to what he perceived as his simpler and purer approach, but the next time I saw him, he informed me that he had in fact changed Monotone's metadata design along those lines, and Monotone's manifest was born. This is essentially what Linus found when he discovered Monotone a short time later.<br>
<p>
Forgive me if I have erred slightly in some details, that was thirteen years ago. Graydon would probably be able to help me with this. Until now, he and I were the only two who knew this detail.<br>
<p>
The story of how Git came to be is a whole lot more complicated than that. The real hero of the story is Andrew Tridgell, who set his brilliant mind to work on creating an open source Bitkeeper client. Though he did not intend it, a fact I can attest to from first hand knowledge, this work set in motion the chain of events that culminated in the author of Bitkeeper himself forcing Linus to do the right thing, and stop forcing the Linux kernel community to depend on a proprietary tool. Everybody knows the rest of the story, but these early events remain shrouded as a bit of a mystery.<br>
<p>
For his efforts, Andrew (Tridge as we know him) was hounded out of the Linux kernel community in a most unseemly way. Linus should put that on his list of unfinished business that he needs to apologize for.<br>
<p>

Linus needed to accept that embedding a bespoke tool astride the kernel development workflow was not going to end well. That point was controversial at the time, but with the clarity of historical perspective it is now settled fact. Instead of accepting that reality, Linus continued on the course of pushing the proprietary workflow further into the faces of those community members who could not accept it.<br>
<p>
For the record, I was not the first to take exception to this ongoing encroachment. As I dimly recall, a group of us were discussing the Bitkeeper issue on the the #kernelnewbies channel, and I had taken the position that I could live with it, so long as I would be able to function as a kernel contributor without being forced to accept the Bitkeeper license. Then one of the channel members pointed out to me that Linus had just merged instructions for a "BK and Kernel Development Workflow" into the kernel source tree. It became immediately apparent that all of us who disagreed with the proprietary license were now well on the way to becoming second class citizens. That was a significant fraction of the community. I hope that you can see why I felt the need to do something.<br>
<p>
Let me forestall the counterargument that I should really have been busy developing an alternative to Bitkeeper, as Linus suggested. I was doing exactly that, and I was not the only one. But I could not possibly have completed that work soon enough to present something usable to Linus, to stave off the looming disaster. And there were significant doubts about whether he would respond just by moving the goal posts in any case. Trying to read Linus's mind is a thankless task. In the end, Linus showed us how to do it: you need to be Linus. Then you just code up a quick prototype to show how you want it done and a team of talented coders descends on it to make it a reality.<br>
<p>
As I said, we could have done the same in 2002 instead of 2005. It might have lacked the elegance of Monotone's content hashes but it would have done the same thing. The global distributed workflow that needed to be supported was already well understood, it already existed.<br>
<p>
Maybe the result would have been even better than Git. Maybe it would have had cleaner commands, maybe it would have supported rename properly, who knows. That is speculation. But it is far from speculative to assert that we had the talent and manpower to do it. There was only one key ingredient missing: resolve from Linus.<br>
<p>
If Linus had understood my message to him at the time, history would have taken a different and better course. I succeeded in getting his attention, but failed to convince him.<br>
<p>
I hope that clarifies the historical context.<br>

<p>
Like spammers, they create new accounts. Intentionally disruptive people are not a new problem, they are not specifically related to codes-of-conduct and they are something all projects, including the kernel, have always had to deal with. Deliberate flouters of codes-of-conduct are just another kind of intentionally disruptive person. (*Accidental* flouting can usually be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.)<br>
<p>
It's very rare to have someone who is intentionally disruptive and also making some meaningful contribution. I've never seen a case at Mozilla where it would have been worth taking their contribution.<br>
<p>
I think there is a good point to be made here, though: explicit or implicit codes-of-conduct do not, unfortunately, eliminate the need to be quite thick-skinned in very popular open-source projects. Firefox Bugzilla has always had a steady stream of new users showing up to throw abusive comments at developers. It sucks, but I guess it's not that different to other open online communities.<br>

      This seems to becoming a classical pattern in people arguing against a CoC: they ignoring the actual content of what people are saying and instead substitute their own cataclysmic assumptions about people mean.
</p>
What Sage Sharp has <em>said</em> is that having someone who has given the impression by his words and arguments that he's unlikely to be sympathetic to a report by a woman suffering sexual harassment on the board that adjudicates complaints is likely to result in women being hesitant to report sexual harassment to the board. Particularly since there's currently no mechanism for sending a report to anyone but the <em>whole</em> board. 
</p>
This doesn't seem to be a particularly unreasonable claim, and seems a perfectly sensible thing to point out as being a problem.

<p>
AFAIK Ted Ts'o has expressed doubts about the statistics and methodology in some studies put forward in a discussion about rape incidence. How that implies that “he's unlikely to be sympathetic to a report by a woman suffering sexual harassment” is unclear to me. It's not as if empathy towards specific individuals and reasonable skepticism about statistics in scientific papers were mutually exclusive. Both are to be encouraged. And it is never wrong to be interested in the facts.

Given that I come from a small town (  5000 people ) in which rumors and false accusation spread from thin air and more often than not those rumors and false accusation break relationship,families and scar people for life.<br>

Why is Ted supposed to be sympathetic and why is his credibility in question if he is not the accused in the matter? <br>
<p>
Is he not allowed by community members to do his own research,form his own opinions based on his own beliefs and perceptions on these topics as any other, or are individuals perceptions supposed to be fixed on certain topic? <br>
<p>
Also is not the TAB supposed to be neither biased or sympathetic to either party but review the facts since they are the judge,jury and potential ( career ) executioners over the accused individual? <br>

Case study: Brendan Eich as head of the Mozilla Corporation. He privately espoused intolerance, even after it got publicity. I see this as contradicting a core value of Mozilla, namely, freedom to be left alone.<br>
<p>
So, he resigned, rightfully claiming that, "under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader." And I supported this move. I still do.<br>

Brendan Eich endorsed intolerance, enforced not through a CoC, but rather with the force of law. I have no problem with his endorsement, but I can't reconcile that with any Free Software leadership position.<br>

I'm not really sure if there's a fundamental conflict with Free Software leadership with someone taking the position Brendan Eich took.  I say this as someone who was *very* directly affected by Prop 8, and very angry about it and those who supported it.<br>
<p>
I just am unsure that there's a fundamental conflict, despite how much I am not excited about interacting as peers or leaders with someone who is willing to take such a drastic step.<br>
<p>
As far as being a leader of a company, I feel rather differently.  Company executives hold a great deal more power over their employees than free software project leaders do over contributors.  I think it's totally reasonable that a leader who takes actions that strongly clash with the values of a company is questioned and possibly rejected by the employees.<br>

I don't know if you intend that last paragraph to apply to Brendan, but in case people aren't aware: AFAIK not a single Mozilla Corporation employee openly advocated (internally or externally) for Brendan to step down. A few Mozilla Foundation employees famously did, but they never reported to Brendan. Their actions were ... not popular within MoCo.<br>

That famous opal thread. The complaint was rejected, the person who was the subject of the complaint has continued to be a top contributor to the project. A CoC doesn't fail because someone raises a complaint. As far as I can, the complaint did not even proceed to a formal process of investigation.<br>

One major issue here is that Linus dropped this bomb, and then disappeared.<br>
<p>
I think there would be far less drama if he had stuck around to explain what exactly it means, how it will be enforced, how the different parts will be interpreted, and perhaps to make amendments and clarifications in response to feedback.<br>
<p>
Without some authority to explain things, wild guesses and paranoia are starting to proliferate. Perhaps it would have been better to leave this matter until his return.<br>

      The thing is, that stuff isn't up to Linus in the first place; as far as I can tell, he doesn't want to have to deal with it.  It's up to the community to figure out and the TAB to implement.  We <i>will</i> figure it out in a way that doesn't trash our community.  We have spent almost three decades building it, and we're not going anywhere.
<p>
Whenever you see "wild guesses and paranoia", it's good to look at the source and ask yourself if this stuff is really coming from inside the community.  There is an awful lot coming from people who otherwise have nothing to do with the kernel.

If it were up to the community to figure out, there would have been a community discussion before the Code of Conduct was in Linus' tree.  It seems *only* the TAB knew this was coming, many maintainers with large subsystems and communities didn't - they don't know where they stand.<br>
<p>
This isn't the type of thing that should be rushed, so I think a lot of the reason there is so much concern is because it *has* been rushed.<br>
<p>
In any case, if anyone wants to lose some hope for humanity, take a look at the comments on GitHub, where Linux development does not take place, by a bunch of people largely unaware of that.<br>

Totally agree concerning the role model part. <br>
<p>
I think it was a good thing that Linus announced that he intends to improve his "conduct", even though in reality, and especially in recent years, it has rarely been a problem (most of those pointing out his "poor conduct" keep repeating the same handful of cases - most of them years old).<br>
<p>
However saying "I've been rude in the past, sorry,  and will improve now" is one thing, as it only *directly* concerns Linus himself, though hopefully it will have beneficial trickle down effects.<br>
Whereas introducing a CoC that creates new rules and responsibilities (especially for maintainers) and raises a lot of issues is quite a different thing.<br>
That it was done in a rush, without discussion, apparently even among maintainers who are the most impacted, seems very strange and contrary to the way the kernel development process normally works.<br>
<p>
Especially as the kernel *already* had a CoC, in the form of the "code of conflict".<br>
Normally when some old code is removed and replaced by something else there is always an explanation in the changelog of *why* it was done.<br>
<p>
Of course Linus *can* commit anything he likes to his tree but that's not the way things normally work so I think it's quite normal that people are surprised and a little concerned when that happens.<br>

Yes, +1 to you and Neil. But good conduct doesn't just happen, it requires individual effort. It is not something we are born with, at least, not most of us, but rather it is something we learn. Maybe it would be helpful to understand the Code of Conduct as less of a rule book and more of a teaching aid.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; and more of a teaching aid.</font><br>
<p>
I'm in favour of a document which serves as a teaching aid.  I don't think the current CoC looks much like one.<br>
<p>
I sometimes do volunteer work with children. The organizers include lots of training (some of it is a legal requirement) relating to providing a safe environment.<br>
This is training for people who's intentions are good, but may have limited experience.<br>
Things that stick in my mind are:<br>
 - "a side hug is a safe hug"<br>
 - "never be alone with a child"<br>
<p>
These things may seem overly cautious, but when you don't know what another person's background is, it really is better to have simple rules like this than you always think it is safe to rely on your own judgement.<br>
<p>
In the kernel community we might easily be interacting with people who have very different experiences and expectations and values that we do.  Just saying that doesn't help a lot.  Giving practical wisdom, like the above, can.<br>
This is why I like "Address the code, not the coder".  It is certainly no guarantee, and sometimes it might seem excessively cautious.  But like the above, it is simple, and it is safe.<br>
A CoC that give practical advise like this - a bit like checkpatch, but for human interactions - could be very valuable.<br>

Link to kernel code of conduct for convenience: <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/code-of-conduct.rst">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/li...</a><br>
<p>
I think the Debian code of conduct is a better document than the kernel code of conduct. However, the latter is far superior to the (flippantly named) code of conflict. It's progress.<br>
<p>
In concrete terms, the Debian code of conduct describes specific desirable behavior under each generic heading. The kernel code of conduct only provides generic headings. On the other hand, the kernel code of conduct gives equal prominence to desirable and undesirable behavior, a point in its favor. For some reason not clear to me, the kernel code of conduct describes undesirable behavior more specifically than desirable behavior. It would be a stronger document if the language was more consistent.<br>
<p>
So as an English composition or a teaching aid, I only give the code of conduct a C+. But as a positive statement of intent to promote a collegial working environment, A+.<br>

Here's an idea I had yesterday. State publicly what standard of conduct, you would like to be held to. That is, encourage others to let you know, when you haven't met your own standard. Write down this standard of conduct, or reuse an existing one, and link to it in your e-mail signature, Twitter profile, or other places, where people can easily find it. For example:<br>
<p>
"I attempt to hold myself in all interactions on this medium to the &lt;a href="<a rel="nofollow" href="https://example.com/codeofconduct.html">https://example.com/codeofconduct.html</a>"&gt;Example Standard Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;."<br>
<p>
As long as it's not in conflict with community standards, I think this could be an even more powerful way to signal intent, especially if this standard is higher than the community one.<br>
<p>
What do you think?<br>

      <blockquote>I personally don't think we need a good "code of conduct" nearly as much as we need good "conduct".</blockquote>

<p>I think it's helpful to have both.  It's obvious that the people at the top of an organization serve as role models for the people further down, so good conduct by Linus will have a tremendously beneficial effect.  But it's also useful for everyone to know what conduct is good and what is bad beyond that.  Explicitly spelling out what is expected of community members should help to reinforce the leaders' modeling that behavior-- provided, at least, that the leaders actually follow their own rules.

As the process evolves within the Linux dev community and other projects, I think putting the projects' own leaders as authority (ie: TAB) will turn out to be suboptimal. <br>
<p>
The leaders might be the problem, many high-functioning technical folks are not high-functioning in empathy (including me!), and they just lack experience in dealing with such situations. It's not a recipe for success.<br>
<p>
Instead, I picture a board setup by Software Freedom Conservancy or similar non-profit, offering to have an advisory role to FOSS projects that agree to delegate CoC conflict resolution to them. We do something similar already for accounting and bank accounts for donations and money for sponsorships...<br>

      Some people have suggested that, in the long term, the TAB is not the right body to be handling CoC issues; it may be that a separate group is set up at some point.  But I think that outsourcing such things to a group outside the kernel community entirely would be a fraught exercise; honestly, I don't see that happening.  As a community, we are not so challenged that we can't figure this out, IMO...

I don't disagree with you, but doing it within the community is also fraught... differently :-)<br>
<p>
For example, SFC keeps money and does accounting on behalf of FOSS projects that _could_ do it themselves. But I remember the era of conflict in FOSS projects over $150 in money for DNS and hosting. That's mostly gone - in part thanks to sourceforge/github/gitlab, and in part thanks to SLC. <br>
<p>
Today, many projects have slightly more interesting amounts of money, and disburse it in sponsorships for conference attendance, etc; and there's almost no problem.<br>
<p>
Could they do their own accounting -- probably? Is it best left to professionals who are less invested? <br>
<p>
To be clear, let me emphasize the _advisory_ aspect of the role I am suggesting, and that such an organization would have to earn its trust (as SLC has done) over time, with even-handed solutions to actual conflicts brought to its inbox.<br>
<p>
Anyway, just an interesting tool, for more than interesting times.<br>

As far as I can tell from brief research, it's an obscure derogatory term with similar meaning to "SJW" or "feminist", occasionally used in such upstanding places as 4chan, referring to a stereotypical young woman with purple hair and a Tumblr account and socially liberal views. It's hard to trace the etymology but I guess the connection might have been reinforced by Vice Admiral Holdo in The Last Jedi (which upset many people because it has competent women in it). And in this specific case the primary author of the Contributor Covenant sometimes has purple hair, so the term has some literal accuracy. It's still incredibly stupid though.<br>

LWN does not need a code of conduct because people largely moderate their own behavior here. In the rare cases that breaks down, Jon will step in with a comment. In extreme cases, he will moderate. That system works well here, but for the kernel community in general, no such benevolent dictator watches over us.<br>

      <blockquote>After 27 years, we still haven't finished bashing the kernel into shape; the code of conduct and its associated processes should come together rather more quickly than that</blockquote>
<p>Because the way that humans behave is less complex and easier to debug than the way computers behave? :-)</p>

Maybe it's "should" used to indicate obligation/duty, rather than "should" used to indicate a probably outcome?<br>

no, because computers require precision commonly not necessary with interactions between humans – a lot more may be left unsaid and the meaning will still come across<br>

Nice try, Corbet.<br>
<p>
Here's your plea:<br>
<p>
"Reading some of those emails (not to mention some of the unpleasant stuff found on the wider Internet), it's hard not to feel that our community is under attack from the outside. Hopefully those people will soon get bored and go back to trying to stir up trouble elsewhere. To the extent that we can encourage their departure by not responding to obvious trolling emails, the better off we will be. As a community, we are far stronger than those who would seek to tear us apart."<br>
<p>
So, engaging in conspiracy theories, are we?<br>
<p>
Your "community" is indeed "under attack from the outside."  It's the SJW warriors that are attacking, not the loyalists like me.<br>
<p>
It's well apparent now that Linux is dead.  This is a corporate takeover, plain and simple.  Good riddance to you, Sir.  I will NEVER support this.<br>
<p>
Let's see if this post stays more than 5 minutes.<br>

Whomever is posting repeated crap to lkml about the GPL under sock puppet email addresses doesn't seem to fit the SJW profile you've created of attackers, but that person is clearly attacking the Linux kernel, and is doing it from the shadows.<br>
<p>
If this is a corporate takeover, please demonstrate the people you think will end up in charge?<br>
<p>
though just go buy a tinfoil at and live the life you clearly dream about, also are you an active kernel contributor? how can you be a loyalist if not?<br>

To use "SJW" is to attack sanity by forcing the dialogue to be about a fictional combatant.  <br>

You really need to review who you're associating yourself with and what ideas you're supporting, becuase they're not good.<br>

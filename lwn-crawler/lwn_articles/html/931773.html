The use of huge pages can make memory management more efficient in a number
of ways, but it can also impose costs in the form of internal fragmentation and
I/O amplification.  At the <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, James Houghton
ran a session on a scheme to get the best of both worlds: using huge pages
while maintaining base-page mappings within them.
<p>
The problem to be solved, Houghton began, is that performance requirements
argue for the use of huge pages to back virtual machines.  So far, so good;
the hugetlbfs system can be used to implement such a policy.  But providers
also want to be able to migrate virtual machines using <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>.
Typical migration schemes will pre-copy the machine to be moved, then use
<tt>userfaultfd()</tt> to catch any post-copy writes and re-copy the
changed pages before committing the moved machine to the new host.  But, if
huge pages are in use, the only information available is that an entire (huge)
page has been touched.  It would be nice to just copy the 4KB base page
that the process changed, but there is no way to know where within a 1GB
huge page that change was made.

To address this problem, he posted <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20230218002819.1486479-1-jthoughton@google.com/">a patch
set</a> in February implementing high-granularity mapping for 1GB hugetlbfs
pages.  This series allows huge pages to be mapped at the PTE (base-page)
level without splitting them.  For now, this work only supports x86
systems, but there is an arm64 version written that has not yet been posted
to the lists.
<p>
There are some challenges in implementing a mechanism like this, he said,
starting with the user-space ABI to control it.  The approach taken was to
<a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20230218002819.1486479-10-jthoughton@google.com/">implement
an <tt>MADV_SPLIT</tt> operation</a> for <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
â€” an approach that David Hildenbrand described as "confusing".  This ABI
seems likely to change in the future if this work proceeds.  There are some
implementation challenges as well, Houghton said; keeping track of the
page-table entries for high-granularity-mapped pages requires access to the
page middle directory (PMD) level of the page-table hierarchy, but the
internal APIs do not always pass that in.  A number of other internal
changes are needed to implement this feature as well, making the
implementation of high-granularity mappings into a 46-part patch set.
<p>
Michal Hocko suggested that, perhaps, the real problem is that this use
case should not be using hugetlbfs as its backing store.  Instead, a
different way of accessing huge pages that does not bring hugetlbfs's
baggage should be found, he said.  If the desire is to keep the huge pages
from being reclaimed, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html"><tt>mlock()</tt></a>
can be used.  Houghton answered that hugetlbfs can guarantee that huge
pages will be available, which is a necessary feature; trying to solve the
problem without hugetlbfs would also require copying many of its quirks
into the core memory-management code.  Hocko said that, perhaps, the right
approach would be to create a driver to obtain huge pages from the <a
href="/Articles/486301/">CMA</a> pool; Houghton thought that might work.
<p>
Another audience member asked whether the transparent hugepage mechanism,
which already supports high-granularity mappings, could be enhanced to
provide guaranteed allocations for this use case.  Another attendee said
that the memory-management subsystem should, eventually at least, be
prepared to handle folios of any size, so the need for special-purpose code
for huge pages should go away.  If this work could get the kernel closer to
that point, that would be a good thing.
<p>
Houghton felt, though, that implementing the needed functionality in the
core memory-management code would be a lot of work, while containing it in a
separate implementation simplifies the task considerably.  That
implementation shows the core changes that would eventually be needed, and
is thus a step in the right direction.  It is not clear that the rest of
the room was in agreement with this position, though; this feature may not
be headed for the mainline in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

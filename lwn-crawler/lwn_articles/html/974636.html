<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
The original Linux kernel, posted in 1991, ran on a system with a 4KB page
size.  Over 30&nbsp;years later, most of us are still running on systems
with 4KB pages, even though the amount of installed memory has grown by a
few orders of magnitude.  It is generally accepted that using large page
sizes results in better performance for most applications, but allocating
larger pages is often difficult.  During a memory-management session at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Yu Zhao presented his
ideas on improving the allocation of huge pages in the kernel.
<p>
It is worth noting that this session was focused on a patch set that was <a
href="/Articles/964239/">examined here in March</a>.  Zhao did not go
deeply into the details of how his improved allocator works in the session;
reading that article now could provide some useful background.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/974642/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/lsfmm/YuZhao-sm.png" alt="[Yu Zhao]"
title="Yu Zhao" class="rthumb"></a>

Zhao started by saying that "some CPU vendor" is planning to drop 4KB pages
entirely within the next decade.  MacOS on Arm systems uses 16KB pages now,
and Google is experimenting with 16KB pages on Android.  He made the
proposition that 4KB pages are suboptimal for modern user space, but the
problem remains that some architectures do not support any other size.
Additionally, changing the base-page size is an ABI break that can cause
problems for some applications.
<p>
Thus, he said, "a forward-looking operating system would offer the
opportunity to favor larger logical pages".  That system would treat 4KB
pages as a legacy feature, but would not require a larger base-page size or
break existing ABIs.  Favoring huge pages over 4KB pages, he said, brings
better performance and lower metadata overhead; that will be even more true
once <a href="/Articles/973565/">the plan to switch to memory
descriptors</a> becomes reality.
<p>
The problem is that the ability to allocate 4KB pages fragments system
memory; defragmentation imposes a cost, and may be impossible.  That
results in an economy where 4KB pages are cheap, and huge pages are
expensive.  The cornerstone of his THP allocation optimization (TAO)
proposal is turning that situation around, making huge pages cheap, and 4KB
pages expensive.
<p>
The ability to assemble huge pages depends partly on the ability to move
small pages out of the way.  The kernel provides allocation-time hints like
<tt>__GFP_MOVABLE</tt> now so that allocations that can (hopefully) be
moved are located together.  Unmovable allocations are a problem, though;
they block assembly of huge pages, and their lifetime is not predictable.
There is a research project at Google (called "Tetris") that is aimed at
determining that lifetime, using statistical sampling and estimation, with
the goal of grouping unmovable allocations by lifetime.
<p>
Low-priority tasks, Zhao said, can fragment memory, impacting the
performance of higher-priority tasks.  It would be nice to be able to
isolate those low-priority tasks, but that needs support from the memory
controller and, perhaps, cooperation from user space.  But another key
component (and a key part of the TAO patches) is memory partitioning.
Fragmentation can be irreversible, he said, so it is best to avoid it by
isolating the smaller allocations in a separate memory partition.  A
well-chosen partitioning scheme, he said, can readily provide huge pages
while applying a higher level of memory pressure to applications that are
making a lot of small allocations.
<p>
Shakeel Butt asked whether the zone for 4KB allocations would be limited to
movable allocations or not.  Zhao replied that it depends on the fallback
order that is chosen.  If, as he suggests, the kernel attempts to allocate
compound (huge) pages before falling back to 4KB pages, then there can be
unmovable objects in the 4KB zone.
<p>
Setting up partitions raises the issue of sizing.  Zhao's proposal sets 
global minimum and maximum limits on the size of the huge-page partition,
but that is only part of the problem.  Low-priority tasks could still hog
the huge pages, so there will have to be a limit, enforced by a control
group, on use of the huge-page partition.  It will be possible to resize
the partitions based on the workload, but that requires memory hotplugging.
Shrinking the huge-page partition should be guaranteed, since those
allocations are all movable; moving in the other direction would be a
best-effort affair.
<p>
A participant asked where the line would be drawn between good (large) and
bad (small) allocations.  Zhao answered that it depends on the system.  For
many, it would be the CPU's continuous-PTE size (often 16KB or 64KB); on
servers it would be the PMD size, which (at 2MB typically) is rather
larger.  There was some inconclusive discussion on what the best size to
use might be.
<p>
Zhao continued, saying that automatic resizing of the partitions will be
needed, based on their relative memory pressure.  The 4KB partition would
be allowed to have a higher pressure as a way of fighting fragmentation.
He suggested that memory pressure in the 4KB partition could invoke
the out-of-memory (OOM) killer, even if the huge-page partition is not
having problems.  There are a number of platforms that use OOM kills as
part of their ordinary operation; Android, ChromeOS, and cloud providers (to
manage batch jobs) are all examples, so bringing in the OOM killer is not
necessarily a bad thing.  The alternative, he said, would be to watch the
huge-page partition fade away due to fragmentation over time.
<p>
Zhao presented some plots showing that systems running with the TAO patches
benefit from improvements in both huge-page allocation rates and web-browser
responsiveness.
<p>
David Hildenbrand asked whether the partition resizing could be done using the
memory-management subsystem's page-block abstraction rather than
hotplugging; Vlastimil Babka replied that page blocks do not have separate
free lists, so they cannot be used to direct allocations in the same way.
Hildenbrand suggested that perhaps extending page blocks might be the right
approach; on big systems, he said, nobody is able to cope with the
complexity of hotplugging.  He would not be able to convince RHEL users to
use the TAO feature.  Configuring phones, which run a single workload, is
easy; servers are rather harder.
<p>
Johannes Weiner pointed out that he had posted <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20230418191313.268131-1-hannes@cmpxchg.org/">a patch
set</a> for reliable huge-page allocation last year.  Reviewers asked
him to split the work apart; some of it is staged to go into the 6.10
release.  He was able to get a success rate of 99% for 2MB huge-page
allocations; that is good enough, he said.  Larger allocations are only of
interest to a small group of users.
<p>
Zhao concluded the session by speaking briefly about the longer-term goals
of his work.  They include using TAO to provide huge pages to back up
hugetlbfs, and the ability to reliably allocate 1GB huge pages.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Especially page tables (and many more things) are unmovable and 4k. Instead of refusing to allocate them, we should do a better job at grouping them to restrict fragmentation locally (what pageblocks already do, and there is work in progress to improve the situation).<br>

I looked at this once (migration of leaf page tables only) and it turned into complexity. It can be done I think, given sufficient brain power and time.<br>
<p>
But it‘s only the tip of the iceberg I’m afraid. Many/most allocations in the kernel are unmovable, only selected (pagecache, anonymous memory, zsmallloc) are movable. We see a lot more unmovable allocations lately, the trend is going into the wrong direction: secretmem and guest_memfd don‘t support page migration at all.<br>

We can try to vmalloc everything in kernel and not use direct mapping at all. That means a kernel data access can trigger a page fault, when the page is under migration. That could cause recursive page faults, if kernel is handling a user page fault or a kernel page fault.<br>

Assuming no memory hot swapping, aren't page tables basically a fixed size for the entire lifetime of a system (as in between two reboots)? Wouldn't they be ideally allocated as huge pages themselves?<br>

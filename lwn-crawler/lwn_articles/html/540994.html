By the time that Linus <a href="/Articles/540993/">released</a> the 3.9-rc1
kernel prepatch and closed the merge window for this cycle, he had pulled a
total of 10,265 non-merge changesets into the mainline repository.  That is
just over 2,000 changes since <a href="/Articles/539892/">last week's
summary</a>.  The most significant user-visible changes merged at the end
of the merge window include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The block I/O controller now has full hierarchical control group
     support.
<p>
<li> The NFS code has gained network namespace support, allowing the
     operation of per-container NFS servers.
<p>
<li> The Intel <a href="/Articles/528124/">PowerClamp driver</a> has been
     merged; PowerClamp allows the regulation of a CPU's power consumption
     through the injection of forced idle states.
<p>
<li> The device mapper has gained support for a new "dm-cache" target that
     is able to use a fast drive (like a solid-state device) as a cache in
     front of slower storage devices.  See <a
     href="/Articles/540996/">Documentation/device-mapper/cache.txt</a> for
     details. 
<p>
<li> RAID 5 and 6 support for the Btrfs filesystem has been merged at last.
<p>
<li> Btrfs defragmentation code has gained snapshot awareness, meaning that
     sharing of data between snapshots will no longer be lost when
     defragmentation runs.
<p>
<li> Architecture support for the Synopsys ARC and ImgTec Meta
     architectures has been added.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> <b>Systems and processors</b>:
     	  Marvell Armada XP development boards,
	  Ralink MIPS-based system-on-chip processors,
	  Atheros AP136 reference boards, and
	  Google Pixel laptops.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Block</b>:
     	  IBM RamSam PCIe Flash SSD devices and
	  Broadcom BCM2835 SD/MMC controllers.

     <p>
     <li> <b>Display</b>: 
     	  TI LP8788 backlight controllers.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     	  Kirkwood 88F6282 and 88F6283 thermal sensors,
	  Marvell Dove thermal sensors, and
	  Nokia "Retu" watchdog devices.
     </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <tt>menuconfig</tt> configuration tool now has proper "save" and
     "load" buttons.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/536293/">rework of the IDR API</a> has been
     merged, simplifying code that uses IDR to generate unique integer
     identifiers.  Users throughout the kernel tree have been updated to
     the new API.
<p>
<li> The <tt>hlist_for_each_entry()</tt> iterator has lost the unused
     "<tt>pos</tt>" parameter.
</ul>
<p>

At this point, the stabilization period for the 3.9 kernel has begun.  If
the usual pattern holds, the final 3.9 release can be expected sometime
around the beginning of May.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

They spontaneously die to firmware glitches sometimes. This is unusual for a hard drive (never had any of my rotating rust do this in 20+ years), but you get used to it after a while. The media isn't actually damaged, just the firmware has stopped talking to you. If removed and re-inserted they will typically wake up and suddenly they're OK again until next time.<br>

Half of the drive is purely for cache. It's 64GB, but it's only 32GB when mounted (the rest being cache). There's no device for the "other half". I'd like to use that part of the drive in dm-cache, not the part I can use.<br>

The rest is intended to be used as the NAND cells wear out. The device has twice as much silicon as it needs so that it can be useful for longer, given the high read-erase patterns of scratch caches. The rest is not cache.<br>

Yeah, I suspected something like this.  So the drive exposes only half of its advertised capacity to the host.  Assuming the touted "intelligent caching algorithms" are implemented in the drive and not the Windows-only software that OCZ provides, maybe it would compare favorably in a dm-cache configuration to conventional SSDs.  Maybe not.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the drives in the link seem to be EOL.<br>

      The small print on that page says it has 50% over-provisioning, so not visible outside of the SSD firmware. That must be there to compensate for the dataplex caching driver doing something not SSD-friendly, like heavy in-place rewriting (which would otherwise prevent the FTL from doing its work refreshing cells and spreading writes). bcache at least only writes whole erase blocks (1MB default bucket size), so it doesn't need that kind of overprovisioning.

I've read that it was planned that flicker-free suspend and resume (i.e. no vt switching for S3) for the Intel KMS driver was planned for this release. Short of going through huge git log, does anybody know off-hand if this change-set made it in? <br>

It might be in 3.9-rc1 already.  I didn't see any vt switching when resuming from suspend (but I never noticed it before either)<br>

Nope, missed the 3.9 cycle. Originally I've merged the core pm/fbdev patches for 3.9, but due to too much config madness and broken compilations I've taken them out again. The drm/i915 part itself wasn't ready in time, we still have outstanding issues. Should all land in 3.10.<br>

Well if you look in kernel/power/suspend.c, in suspend_prepare(), you can see an unconditional call to pm_prepare_console(), and in kernel/power/console.c pm_prepare_console() always calls vt_move_to_console(SUSPEND_CONSOLE, 1), where <br>
#define SUSPEND_CONSOLE (MAX_NR_CONSOLES-1)<br>
<p>
This will always switch console unless disable_vt_switch is set, and that only gets set by a call to pm_set_vt_switch(0).<br>
<p>
This is only called by drivers/video/geode/gxfb_core.c and drivers/video/geode/gxfb_core.c, which defaults it to 0 unless it is set by a module parameter:<br>
<p>
module_param(vt_switch, int, 0);<br>
MODULE_PARM_DESC(vt_switch, "enable VT switch during suspend/resume");<br>
<p>
<p>
So it looks like, with 3.9-rc1, you always get a vt switch at suspend/resume unless you have a GEODE video controller.<br>
<p>
(note to self:  I really should use that pm_set_vt_switch() call for my omap3 display on the GTA04 instead of commenting out the call to pm_prepare_console())<br>

      I don't use it myself, but Phoronix <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTI3MjM">mentioned</a> that this merge has part of intel's "fastboot" work, which seems to be about reusing bios-allocated frame buffers.

      Also, here is <a href="http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1302.3/00558.html">airlied's pull request</a>. It doesn't name fastboot, but does give a shootout to “the worst news site ever”, the one I've just linked to :P

Getting fastboot merged is a long road, we've pulled in preparatory infrastructure since 3.7. Currently I'm optimistic that 3.10 will have something which can actually avoid the initial modeset in some configurations. But there are still a lot of loose pieces to nail down.<br>

Thanks all for the answers, that's exactly what I wanted to know.<br>
<p>
Looking forward to flicker-free suspend/resume. Because I do that approximately a 100 times more often than rebooting, so not sure why everybody cares so much about flicker-free boot, with suspend states working stable and fast.I also hope to get a nice speedup from this, as the vt switch takes a long time here and is quite blocking.<br>
<p>
Now if I only could convince networkmanager to not drop the wifi connection purposefully, on suspend/resume, because that's apparently not necessary anymore with this nice ultrabook hardware. Using ifup/ifdown, it does not and is immediately online. Did anybody try that?<br>

The "immediately" online behaviour isn't really immediate, you will typically have been disconnected from the AP. In fact, this disconnection is now going to be enforced for 3.10 because the other behaviour doesn't gain a whole lot (you still need to reconnect etc.) and trying to keep the connection causes a huge amount of issues, particularly with USB hardware (that can be unplugged while suspended.)<br>
<p>
The "ultrabook" behaviour you refer to can be achieved with WoWLAN (<a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/WoWLAN">http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/WoWLAN</a>) and network scanning offload (while in suspend), but this doesn't exist in Linux yet.<br>
<p>
However, a much easier solution could be implemented in NetworkManager: instead of scanning on all channels when resuming, it could scan just the channel that it was previously connected on. If that finds the previously connected AP, it would be able to reconnect almost immediately (delay of less than half a second), vs. a full scan that can take up to 10-15 seconds. This should be a fairly simple NetworkManager change.<br>

It's also not as if this kind of problem is unique to Linux or NetworkManager, I experience very similar behavior on my MacOSX laptop when resuming from suspend, so this is a common problem with wireless.  The stated solution probably won't speed up connection when changing location but keeping the same SSID as you will likely be connecting to a different AP on a different channel and it'll have to scan anyway.<br>

Well, yes. Although you could scan the channels in the right order, i.e. the ones that you'd expect the same network (SSID) on first. Say your corporate installation -- it's probably only going to use a handful of channels (1,6,11,36,149 or so), so if you know from "experience" that (almost) all of the APs for the network are there, you can scan those first.<br>
<p>
But ultimately you're right, in the general case you have to scan all channels and that simply takes a while. It shouldn't be more than a few seconds since you're not connected; here it takes ~3.5 seconds to scan all the channels my card supports, but I know that it can be (much) slower depending on the device.<br>

well, you should first check the channel you were last using, and then do the normal scan you would do if someone just gave the SSID and told you to connect to it.<br>

Yeah, that's what I suggested first (and indeed Dan has now opened a bug for to implement it in NM), however it is possible to break it down further like I was trying to describe later:<br>
<p>
 1) scan the last channel<br>
 2) scan the known channels for the last SSID<br>
 3) scan all (remaining) channels<br>
<p>
The intermediate step only makes sense if those known channels are a relatively small subset of all channels, but with typical installations they will be. In fact, for many networks like your home network 1) and 2) will be exactly the same because you only have a single AP, but for typical enterprise networks 2) will still be better than 3).<br>

      Somewhat tangentially there's a very interesting article about <a href="http://cafbit.com/entry/rapid_dhcp_or_how_do">DHCP tricks that MacOS X</a> does to reconnect faster.
<p>
I'd love to see Network Manager pick up something from that.
</p>
Instead, currently when I suspend a laptop via ssh -t foo sudo pm-suspend, I get to enjoy a lapsed DHCP lease on resume, for a few hours.  According to strace that's because dhcpd expiration timer (i.e. select() with a timeout) simply stops while the laptop is suspended.  Connection still works, but the  wifi router doesn't resolve the laptop's hostname until dhcpd finally wakes up.

      <p>If CLOCK_MONOTONIC in Linux actually worked according to POSIX spec, then a timer based on this clock could be used to fix this problem.</p>

<p>(POSIX says that CLOCK_MONOTONIC measures time elapsed since <i>"an unspecified point in the past"</i>, and further <i>"This point does not change after system start-up time."</i>.  On Linux however, CLOCK_MONOTONIC stops while the system is suspended, which is clearly nonconforming).</p>

      I think "dm-cache" is more similar to <a href="http://visa.cs.fiu.edu/tiki/dm-cache">"dm-cache"</a>, first posted to LKML in 2006. Both are dm targets with pluggable tiering policies. EnhanceIO has some older dm-cache code by way of Flashcache, but it doesn't have the pluggable policies (I don't know if Flashcache slashed it or if there was some convergent evolution later).

      It seems to be the fastest of the lot, and an earlier version is in use at Google. Currently the maintainer is spoon-feeding some BIO and AIO rework through maintainer reviews, and I have no idea how much of the supporting infrastructure is left to merge at this point. It's not terribly user-friendly at the moment: no dm target that would allow in-place migration, and you have to stick to a maintainer tree for continued data access (even though a pass-through shim would be sufficient for non-writeback uses).

Have you benchmarked bcache vs dm-cache vs enhanceio?  If so I'd love to see what you found.  We have an "all-caches" branch here:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/jthornber/linux-2.6/tree/all-caches">https://github.com/jthornber/linux-2.6/tree/all-caches</a><br>
<p>
But we definitely need to definitely update the bcache and enhanceio code.<br>
<p>
Also, please note that there are some dm-cache fixes that will likely be sent to Linus for 3.9-rc2 that Alasdair (DM maintainer) has staged here: <a href="http://people.redhat.com/agk/patches/linux/editing/series.html">http://people.redhat.com/agk/patches/linux/editing/series...</a><br>

The user unfriendliness exists to protect your data when using write-back.<br>
<p>
It is kinda annoying, I know.<br>
<p>
But if a normal block device would be used as a backing store there is nothing to preventing accidental use even though there might be dirty data on the cache device.<br>
<p>
The EnhanceIO developers use some udev scripts to prevent this, I haven't looked at how they do it. I guess that could work, the EnhanceIO developers said they haven't seen any problems yet. But I can definitely see why the bcache developer made his choice.<br>
<p>
If a cachesystem would have be integrated in the filesystem the filesystem could have something recorded which would prevent it from being mounted without the user forcing it in some way when the cache device is never coming back.<br>
<p>
It is kinda interesting to see there are 6 ways/ideas floating around to do caching or caching related things now for the Linux kernel:<br>
- dm-cache, now in the kernel I guess<br>
- Facebook Flashcache<br>
- Google bcache<br>
- EnhanceIO was based on Flashcache I believe<br>
- If I'm not mistake in recent kernels there is code in the VFS which keeps track of which data is hot<br>
- btrfs developers are looking at doing something in btrfs, if I remember correctly they have expressed some interest in the VFS solution<br>
<p>
The dm-cache, EnhanceIO and bcache have 'spoken' on the mailinglist and one even mentioned he didn't see any problem in having several implementations in the mainline kernel.<br>
<p>
I'm not so sure Linus would even accept those patches. :-)<br>
<p>
It is interesting and maybe sometimes seems a bit painful to see that many different efforts. They obviously all have their strengths and weaknesses of course.<br>

If the module is added to the kernel the porting will be done for you. Plus the various kernel versions automatically will either have or won't have that parameter.<br>
<p>
Or in other words: pretty well known that there is no stability guarantee and the developers prefer to include your module/driver in the kernel. Seems that this often also gets you a good review (thus better quality).<br>

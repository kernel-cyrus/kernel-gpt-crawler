<h1>Virtually mapped stacks 2: thread_info strikes back</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 29, 2016</br>
           </div>
In <a href="/Articles/692208/">last week's episode</a>, Andy Lutomirski had
posted a set of patches moving kernel stacks to the kernel's
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> area.  There are a number of advantages to doing so,
including elimination of some high-order memory allocations, improved
security, and better diagnostic output when a stack overflow occurs.  There
was just one little problem: an additional 1.5µs of kernel overhead during
process creation, a cost that Linus was unwilling to accept.  The first
attempt to address that cost ran afoul of an obscure kernel data structure,
but the end result looks to be a substantial cleanup of the kernel's
management of process information.
<p>
The performance regression comes from using <tt>vmalloc()</tt> to allocate
kernel stacks; <tt>vmalloc()</tt> is a relatively expensive way to allocate
memory and has not been subjected to the same sort of optimization work
that the slab allocators have seen.  One suggestion that had been made was
to cache a small number of kernel stacks, allowing the quick reuse of
cache-hot stacks after processes exit.  The hope was that, by eliminating
<tt>vmalloc()</tt> calls, the code could be made faster in general.
<p>
<h4>A useless cache</h4>
<p>
Andy went off to implement this idea and <a
href="/Articles/692955/">reported</a> a discouraging result: "<q>I
implemented a 
percpu cache, and it's useless.</q>"  The problem, in short, is that a
process's resources (including its kernel stack) are not cleaned up
immediately when the process exits.  Instead, the read-copy-update (RCU)
mechanism is used to ensure that no references to those resources remain
before they are freed.  That means (1)&nbsp;the freeing of the kernel
stack will be delayed until the end of the next RCU grace period, and
(2)&nbsp;the resources for <i>all</i> processes that exited during that
grace period will be freed together.  So the cache for kernel stacks will
almost always be empty, then will occasionally be hit with large numbers of
released stacks, most of which will not fit into the cache and, thus, will
be simply 
freed.  In other words, the cache hit rate, especially with fork-heavy
loads, will be close to zero.

<p>
In theory there should be no need for a process's kernel stack after that
process has died, so one might think that the stack could be released
immediately, even if the other data structures need to stay around.  The
problem is that the core information the kernel maintains about processes
lives in two different places:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The massive <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/sched.h#n1457"><tt>task_struct</tt></a>
     structure, found in <tt>&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</tt>.  This structure,
     which is (modulo a disturbing number of <tt>#ifdef</tt> blocks)
     architecture-independent, contains most of the information the kernel
     needs to know about a running process.
<p>
<li> The small <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#n45"><tt>thread_info</tt></a>
     structure, which is architecture-specific.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>task_struct</tt> structure is allocated from the heap like most
other kernel data structures.  The <tt>thread_info</tt> structure, though,
lives at the bottom of the kernel stack, making it impossible
to reuse the kernel stack as long as something might try to reference that
structure.  For a brief period, Linus pursued changes
that would allow the <tt>thread_info</tt> structure to be freed quickly,
even while the 
<tt>task_struct</tt> structure persisted, but it quickly became clear that
no easy solutions were to be found in that direction.  Some information in
<tt>thread_info</tt>, the <tt>flags</tt> field in particular, can be
accessed at surprising times and needs to remain available as long as the
kernel has any record of the associated process at all.
<p>
The existence of these two structures is something of a historical
artifact.  In the early days of Linux, only the <tt>task_struct</tt>
existed, and the whole thing lived on
the kernel stack; as that structure grew, though, it became too large to
store there.  But placement on the kernel stack conferred a significant
advantage: the structure could be quickly located by masking some bits out
of the stack pointer, meaning there was no need to dedicate a scarce
register to storing its location.  For certain heavily used fields, this
was not an optimization that the kernel developers wanted to lose.
So, when the <tt>task_struct</tt> was moved out of the kernel-stack area, 
a handful of important structure fields were left there,
in the newly created <tt>thread_info</tt> structure.  The resulting
two-structure solution is still present in current kernels, but it doesn't
necessarily have to be that way.
<p>
<h4>Getting rid of thread_info</h4>
<p>
In relatively recent times, the kernel has moved to using per-CPU variables
to store many types of frequently-needed information.  The scheduler caches
some crucial 
process-related information about the currently running process in the
per-CPU area; that turns out to be faster than looking at the bottom of the
kernel stack.  So the amount of useful data stored in <tt>struct
thread_info</tt> has decreased over time.  Given that, an obvious question
comes to mind: could the <tt>thread_info</tt> structure be removed
altogether?  The question is not exactly new; moving <tt>struct
thread_info</tt> away from the kernel stack was one of Andy's objectives
from the beginning.  But the performance issue gave this question a higher
level of urgency.
<p>
Linus quickly <a href="/Articles/692957/">discovered</a> that some users of
the <tt>thread_info</tt> structure have no need of it, even with no other
changes.  Mostly they used it to find the <tt>task_struct</tt> structure —
which, typically, they already had a pointer to.  He fixed those, and
committed the result for the <a href="/Articles/692762/">4.7-rc5</a>
release.  This kind of change might not qualify as the sort of bug fix that
late-cycle patches are normally restricted to, but he <a
href="/Articles/692958/">made it clear</a> that he thought they were an
acceptable change: "<q>Those are the 'purely legacy reasons for a bad
calling convention', and I'm ok with those during the rc series to make it
easier for people to play around with this.</q>"
<p>
He pushed the work further, getting to a point where he could move the
(somewhat reduced) <tt>thread_info</tt> structure off the stack, and embed
it within the <tt>task_struct</tt> instead.  That work progressed to
where it would boot on a test system; Andy then picked it up and integrated it
into his larger patch series.
<p>
As of this writing, that series is in <a href="/Articles/693026/">its
fourth revision</a>.  It moves many <tt>thread_info</tt> fields into
<tt>task_struct</tt>, changing the users of those fields along the way.  At
the end, the 
<tt>thread_info</tt> structure, now containing only the <tt>flags</tt>
field, is moved over to the <tt>task_struct</tt> as well.  Getting there
requires a number of changes to the low-level architecture code, so it is
an x86-only change at the moment.  It seems likely that other architectures
will follow along, though; getting rid of the separate <tt>thread_info</tt>
structure is a useful cleanup and security enhancement, even without the
rest of the work.
<p>
With regard to the real objective of the patch set (moving kernel stacks to
the <tt>vmalloc()</tt> area): the removal of the
<tt>thread_info</tt> structure makes it possible to free the kernel stack
as soon as the owning process exits — no RCU grace period required.  That,
in turn, makes it sensible to add a small per-CPU cache holding up to two
free kernel stacks.  With the cache, Andy says, the 1.5µs performance
regression becomes a 0.5&ndash;1µs performance gain.
<p>
So, at this point, Andy has a patch series that simplifies some core code,
provides immediate detection of kernel-stack overruns, gives better
diagnostics when that occurs, improves the security of the kernel, and even
makes things run faster.  Unsurprisingly, objections are now becoming
difficult to find.  The only remaining question might be when to merge this
code, and the answer appears to be during the 4.8 merge window.  That is
arguably aggressive, given the fundamental nature of the changes and the
fact that there must certainly be a surprise or two still lurking there;
indeed, <a href="/Articles/693021/">one such surprise</a> is still being
worked out as of this writing.
But the 4.8 cycle should give time to work through those surprises, and the
end result should be worth having.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I've seen no talk of increasing the stack size, but allocating them from the <tt>vmalloc()</tt> area would certainly remove the biggest impediment to doing so.

Indeed we could possibly do things the way userspace does, and have small initial stacks which use a guard page to expand at need, with a high sanity check to kill things if it gets huge. If that works (and it might not, since the kernel stack can presumably expand at times when vmalloc() is hard to do), hello recursive algorithms, deep recursion of nested filesystems, etc etc... it's probably hard to impossible but it sounds like a good place to aim for.<br>

This would be difficult for a different reason on x86: page faults use the stack.  This means that a stack overflow gets a double fault, and the manual warns against trying to recover.<br>

Ug! OK, that's a deal breaker. A real shame, but stacks are "very hardware" and limitations like this often turn up. (Also, double faults are extra-slow: you don't want to incur those unless you really have to.)<br>
<p>
I do suspect that recovery from double faults is, at best, very lightly tested, if at all, so even if it works on one CPU it might well fail on another. Ah well :(<br>
<p>
(On allocation failure, you obviously kill the process just like you would on a detected stack overflow in the soon-to-be-current world. That's no different from userspace.)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; On allocation failure, you obviously kill the process just like you would on a detected stack overflow in the soon-to-be-current world. That's no different from userspace.</font><br>
<p>
Userspace has the kernel to clean up things like locks that were held at the time the process was killed. Who cleans up when a kernel thread dies unexpectedly due to an asynchronous out-of-memory condition? You can't just terminate a kernel thread at any arbitrary point, but you can't resume the thread either without extending the stack.<br>
<p>
Stack overflow is a programming error; you know how much stack you allocated and—barring unbounded recursion, variable-length arrays, or alloca()—can statically calculate how much you need (in the worst case) to complete a given function call. Stack overflow in a kernel thread could thus be treated as a bug with the potential to halt the system. An out-of-memory condition resulting from delayed allocation of stack pages is an entirely different matter. That can occur at any time, depending on the amount of memory available.<br>

I wasn't thinking kernel threads for this, I was thinking user threads in kernel mode -- but these have the same problem because they're not killable at arbitrary points, only when schedule()d or when returning to userspace. So yes, indeed, this is a doomed idea (like most of my ideas!)<br>
<p>
I was hoping we could *get*, not unbounded, but arbitrarily deep recursion: in complex situations like stacks of filesystems it can be very hard to compute how much space might be needed in advance, and possibly impractical to allocate it for every task just in case. What you're saying here is that system administrators can cause kernel bugs by stacking filesystems. That's the situation we have now, but it's very far from ideal: there is no conceptual reason why you shouldn't be able to stack the things fifty or five million deep (though obviously performance would start to suck!)<br>

There are other ways to achieve the same result. One approach would be to employ "trampoline" functions; this only works if one filesystem can hand off to another without any further involvement. Rather than call the other filesystem directly you return a transformed version of the request, unwinding the stack, and a top-level iterative function passes the transformed request on to the other filesystem. When applicable, this approach can handle any number of nested filesystems in constant space.<br>
<p>
Another approach which is more compatible with existing code would be to explicitly extend the stack before calling into the other filesystem. Allocation failure at this point could be handled safely like any other out-of-memory condition:<br>
<p>
if (!ensure_minimum_stack(8192)) return -ENOMEM;<br>
nested_filesystem_call();<br>
<p>
The problem was in extending the stack implicitly through page faults, where allocation cannot be allowed to fail, not the basic concept of having an extendable stack.<br>

Nice one Linus, by not accepting the trade off with performance, the result is in end much better!<br>

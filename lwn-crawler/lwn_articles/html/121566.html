<h1>NETIF_F_LLTX and race conditions</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted February 1, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Network drivers must provide a function (<tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt>) for
the networking layer to call whenever it decides the time has come to send
out a packet.  Normally, calls to <tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> are serialized
with a spinlock (<tt>xmit_lock</tt>) in the <tt>net_device</tt> structure.
In this way, the networking subsystem guarantees that it will not attempt
to send multiple packets simultaneously on the same interface.
<p>

This method works, but it is not quite ideal, especially for
high-performance network adaptors.  Most drivers already implement
their own internal locking, rendering <tt>xmit_lock</tt> redundant.  The
<tt>xmit_lock</tt> can also cause a certain amount of cache line bouncing
on SMP systems with a lot of networking traffic.  To work around these
problems, the <tt>NETIF_F_LLTX</tt> "feature" flag was added in 2.6.9.  If
a driver sets <tt>NETIF_F_LLTX</tt> on its interface, it is declaring that
it performs its own locking, and its <tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> function
will be called without the <tt>xmit_lock</tt> held.

<p>
All seemed well for a while, but, back in December, Roland Dreier <a
href="/Articles/121569/">noticed a problem</a>.  When a network driver
notices that an interface's transmit buffers are too full to accept any
more packets, it calls <tt>netif_stop_queue()</tt> to inform the networking
layer.  Its <tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> method should then not be called
until the driver (with a call to <tt>netif_wake_queue()</tt>) indicates
that new packets can, once again be accepted.  Network drivers thus can
count on not being asked to transmit packets when they have stopped the
queue.

<p>
Unless, as it turns out, they have set <tt>NETIF_F_LLTX</tt>.  The lack of
transmit locking in the networking layer itself leads to a situation where
<tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> can be called simultaneously on multiple
processors; <tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> is supposed to handle that situation
with its own locking.  But, if one <tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> call fills
the transmit buffer and stops the queue, the second call will proceed in a
state it had not expected: it has a packet to transmit but no place to put
it.  In most cases, this race leads to a strange error message in the
system logs.  In a poorly-written driver, worse things could happen.

<p>
Roland's initial problem report included a patch which silenced the log
message.  The networking hackers <a href="/Articles/121581/">did not like
that solution</a>, however; they feared that it could hide serious
(unrelated) bugs.  So they set out to come up with a better solution.  The
result was a lengthy patch which made some significant changes to how
network driver locking works.  Uses of <tt>xmit_lock</tt> were changed to
disable interrupts, so that lock could be used in interrupt handlers as
well.  Drivers could then use <tt>xmit_lock</tt> (rather than their own
lock) for internal locking.  The <tt>NETIF_F_LLTX</tt> flag was redefined
to indicate that the transmit routine was completely lockless, a condition
which only applies to certain types of software device.  The end result was
most of the advantages of <tt>NETIF_F_LLTX</tt> but with the race condition
solved.  A version of this patch was merged as part of 2.6.11-rc2.
<p>

Unfortunately, there were some difficulties.  The locking changes led to
deadlocks in certain situations where the driver would try to grab a lock
already held by the networking code which called it.  Network drivers had
to be careful not to do anything (such as <tt>spin_unlock_irq()</tt>) which
would enable interrupts while <tt>xmit_lock</tt> was held.
<tt>dev_kfree_skb()</tt> could no longer be called in any place where
<tt>xmit_lock</tt> was held, since its use is not legal when interrupts are
disabled.  Overall, there were enough problems with this approach that the
patch was backed out after the -rc2 release, and the developers started
over.
<p>

The current approach, as <a href="/Articles/121585/">proposed</a> by David
Miller, is to leave things as they are and silence the log message.  The
patch has been tweaked a bit since first proposed by Roland in December; it
now tries to distinguish the <tt>NETIF_F_LLTX</tt> race from other (more
serious) calls to <tt>hard_start_xmit()</tt> with the transmit buffer
full.  This is done by checking to see if the queue has been stopped; if
so, it is a harmless race and transmission of the packet is silently
deferred.  If the queue is still running, however, then something has gone
wrong somewhere.  This change must be made in all drivers which use
<tt>NETIF_F_LLTX</tt> - a relatively small set.  It's a small change, but
it is a change in the rules for network drivers and worth being aware of.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The definition of "stable kernel" has changed.  The latest kernel release in an even-numbered series is not the "stable kernel" anymore.  Now that releases which just fix bugs (e.g. security holes) and releases which add features have been thoroughly conflated, that's the way it's gotta be.  The latest kernel release from your disto or hardware vendor is the "stable kernel" now.  Presumably it's an older kernel with backported bugfixes.<br>

Not if you're running any of the following distributions (and some others too):<br>
<p>
Fedora Core 2 or 3<br>
(once it comes out) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (or recompiled clones thereof)<br>
SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 9<br>
SuSE Linux 9.1 or 9.2<br>
Ubuntu<br>
Mandrake 10.x<br>
<p>
2.6 is slowly but steadily taking over...<br>

      I presume you're saying that the distributions mentioned are providing stabilized 2.6-based kernels, or recommending them, or abandonning support of 2.4-based kernels.
<p>
But I still maintain that if you find a stable Linux kernel, it's more likely to be based on 2.4, because these 2.6-based ones simply aren't stable in the way we got used to in the 2.4 days.  The code in 2.6-based kernels is substantially newer and less exposed than in the 2.4-based ones.
<p>
I'm still hopeful that the distributions will stick with an old 2.6 level and let it stabilize, but so far I haven't seen the evidence that they will.  If they frequently "upgrade" by grabbing all of Linus's recent changes, we'll still have to look to something 2.4-based for any kind of stability.

      If you need to run the absolute latest kernel, and care about stability, then you need to set up a test environment and test each release before putting it into production. This is true no matter what pre-release testing procedure is built into the kernel release cycle - chances are no kernel developer has your production environment as a desktop machine!<br>
<p>
If you're lazy, you wait for a kernel to age, like a fine wine.<br>
<p>
Or you can do what most people do, and use the kernel that comes with your distribution.<br>

<p>Aging doesn't make the bugs go away.  And bugs are always there.

<p>The kind of aging you're talking about happens to a series of kernels, not a particular one, and is more precisely called "stabilizing."  That doesn't happen any more in kernel.org kernel series, but does in some Linux distribution kernel series.

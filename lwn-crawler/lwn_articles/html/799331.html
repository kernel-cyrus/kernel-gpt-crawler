           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 19, 2019</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2019-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">LPC</a>
</div>
The GNU C Library has long had a reputation for being hostile to the
addition of wrappers for new Linux system calls; that has resulted in many
system calls being unsupported by the library for years.  That situation is
changing, though.  During the Toolchain microconference at the 2019 Linux
Plumbers Conference, Maciej Rozycki talked about glibc's new attitude
toward system-call wrappers, but also served notice that there is still
significant work to do for the addition of any new system call.
<p>
Rozycki, who put together the talk with Dmitry Levin, is not the person
doing most of this work.  He was, instead, "delivering a message from
Florian Weimer", who was unable to attend the event.
<p>
For those who might appreciate a bit of background:
applications running in user space do not call directly into the kernel;
instead, they will call a wrapper function that knows how to invoke the
system call of interest.  If nothing else, the wrapper will place the
system-call arguments in the right locations and do whatever is necessary
to invoke a trap into kernel mode.  In some cases, the interface
implemented by the wrapper can be significantly different from what the
kernel provides.
<p>
The provision of a specialized wrapper is not strictly necessary; an
application can always gain access to an unsupported system call by way of
the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html"><tt>syscall()</tt></a>
function.  But, as Rozycki began, there are good reasons to not require
applications to do that.  There is no type-checking of arguments with
<tt>syscall()</tt>, for example.  System-call numbers vary from one
architecture to the next, even if a Linux kernel is running in both cases,
and there can be other ABI differences as well; that makes writing portable

<a href="/Articles/799336/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lpc/MaciejRozycki-sm.jpg" alt="[Maciej Rozycki]"
title="Maciej Rozycki" class="rthumb"></a>

code with <tt>syscall()</tt> difficult.  Then, there are the difficulties
that come with POSIX threads and thread cancellation in particular.  It is
just better to have proper C-library support for the system calls that
applications need to use.
<p>
So the intention in the glibc project has shifted from blocking system-call
wrappers to accepting them.  They can't all come in at once, though; each
must clear some obstacles first.  These include proper documentation in the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/">glibc manual</a> and,
since glibc is a Free Software Foundation project, copyright-assignment
paperwork in place.  That last requirement led to a discussion on whether
requiring copyright on system-call wrappers amounts to a recognition of ABI
copyrights in general — surprisingly, no useful conclusions came from that
part of the conversation.  The final problem with getting wrappers merged,
Rozycki said, is common to all free-software projects: a lack of reviewers
to look them over.
<p>
The project has adopted a policy of not emulating system calls in almost
all circumstances.  If a given system call is not available, the library
will return <tt>ENOSYS</tt> and be done with it.  System-call emulation has
proved to be error-prone, so it will only be done in the most trivial of
cases.  Glibc also requires that wrapper names be
architecture-independent, the alternative being a "maintenance nightmare".
If possible, the glibc developers want to add support for all architectures
in a single release; otherwise keeping track of things gets difficult.
<p>
Glibc developers have also learned a lesson that has been felt in kernel
circles, even if that lesson is still not always taken to heart: multiplexing
system calls are painful to support.  They make the checking of argument
types difficult or impossible, and the situation is even worse for variadic
calls (those which take different numbers of arguments for different
operations).    One result of this aversion to multiplexing system calls may well be
that calls like <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html">futex()</a></tt>
and <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html">bpf()</a></tt> will
probably be implemented in glibc as a set of independent wrappers, one for
each operation.
<p>
There are some specific ABI rules that have been adopted for system-call
wrappers.  For example, <tt>ssize_t</tt> or <tt>size_t</tt> should be used
for all buffer sizes, regardless of the type the kernel uses; that helps to
make the purpose of the argument clear.  Flags should not have a
<tt>long</tt> type, since it's often unclear how the upper 32&nbsp;bits
should be handled on 32-bit machines.  Errors should always be returned via
<tt>errno</tt>, except for the POSIX threads calls, which are a perennial
exception.  The glibc developers also feel that their lives would be easier
if each new system call had a separate kernel UAPI header file for its
associated types and constants.  That allows them to include the required
information without bringing in any unrelated declarations.
<p>
Rozycki concluded by asking for better cooperation with the C-library
projects in general.  They should be copied on patches containing ABI
changes, for example.  I noted that there are often times where C-library
developers wish the kernel community had done things differently; how could
those be avoided in the future?  Members of the audience suggested that
more glibc developers should perhaps join the linux-api list.  The other
suggestion was to "copy Florian on everything".
<p>

Levin added that
sometimes documentation can be a limiting issue, ironically it can be worse
if a new system call comes out of the kernel community with documentation
already written.  If the author will not
assign copyright for that documentation to the FSF for inclusion in the
manual, progress 
can be blocked; the glibc developers will have to find a way to recreate it
without copying the original.  This struck some in the audience as a
self-imposed problem.
<p>
At the end of session, Christian Brauner said that getting changes into
glibc used to be a painful process, but that has changed in recent years.
Even the infamous <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gettid.2.html">gettid()</a></tt>
system call, the subject of a <a
href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6399">years-long,
acrimonious enhancement request</a>, has now been merged, to the amazement
of many.  The glibc community is now interacting much more with the kernel
community, a change that, hopefully, will continue over time and
be echoed on the kernel side.

If the multiplex call is wrapped by the C library then you can have a separate C function for each mode, each one with a sane and type-safe interface. System calls are a finite resource but C library interfaces are not. However, if you take the view that the C library should provide exactly the interface given by the kernel, a messy system call will result in messy user code. <br>

I would say the kernel and the glibc developers should work together *before* new syscalls are set in stone to, as far as possible, come up with a design that suites everyone and makes the wrappers simpler.<br>
<p>
That may not be possible in every case for technical reasons but I think up to recently it was more of lack of communication between the kernel and glibc developers that caused most problems rather than specific technical issues.<br>

I suspect that it's a side-effect that wiring up even completely architecture-independent system calls across all architectures used to be very complicated, so that system call additions tended to be spread across many kernel releases. With a multiplexer, you only have to go through the process once. Likewise for adding the system call wrapper to glibc.<br>
<p>
Truly problematic are only system calls for which the intended implementation uses va_list in some way. The increased type safety may be worthwhile for separate functions, and it generally increases source portability once rarely used types change (e.g. file offsets with fcntl, times with futex). But that seems to be difficult to predict.<br>

      If you want to see how different system call numbers can be you can take a look at my <a href="https://fedora.juszkiewicz.com.pl/syscalls.html">syscalls table</a>.

<p>I generate it around every -rc1 kernel release and often at final one.

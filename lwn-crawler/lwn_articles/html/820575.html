<a href="/Articles/820337/">OSPM</a>
</div>
Over the years, the kernel's CPU scheduler has become increasingly aware of
how much load every task is putting on the system; this information is used
to make smarter task placement decisions.  Sometimes, though, this logic
can go wrong, leading to a situation that Valentin Schneider describes as
"utilization inversion". At the 2020 <a
href="http://retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit/">Power Management and Scheduling
in the Linux Kernel summit</a> (OSPM), he described the problem and some
approaches that are being considered to address it.
<p>
Utilization tracking, initially conceived as <a
href="/Articles/531853/">per-entity load-tracking</a> or PELT, gives the
scheduler information about what the impact of running a task on a given
CPU will be.  It is used in the schedutil CPU-frequency governor to select
a frequency appropriate to the current workload.  On Arm <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE">big.LITTLE</a> 
systems, where some processors are faster and more power-hungry than
others, the utilization-tracking signal is also used to decide which type
of CPU a task should run on.  The situation is complicated a bit by <a
href="/Articles/762043/">utilization clamping</a>, which allows an
administrator to make a task's utilization appear larger or smaller than it
really is.  Clamping is used to bias the placement of specific tasks and
influences CPU-frequency selection as well.
<p>
Imagine, Schneider said, a large task (one with a high utilization) and a
small task, both of which are contending for the same lock.  The large task
may have a high minimum clamp, so it looks like an even bigger load even
when it is not doing much; the small task, instead, may have a low maximum,
ensuring that it always looks small.  One would expect the large task to

<a href="/Articles/820586/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2020/ospm/Lelli-Schneider-sm.png" alt="[Valentin
Schneider]" title="Valentin Schneider" width=229 height=172 hspace=3
vspace=3 border=0 align="right"></a>

run on a big CPU at a high frequency while the small task is consigned to a
small CPU at a low frequency.  If the small task grabs the lock, the large
task's progress suddenly depends on how quickly the small task can
progress.
<p>
This situation is similar to priority inversion, though the problem is not
as severe.  Even so, it would be better if the small task could inherit
some of the large task's resources while it holds the lock.
<p>
The kernel's realtime mutexes can handle priority inheritance now; if a
high-priority task contends for a lock held by a low-priority task, the
latter will have its priority boosted until it drops the lock.  Priority
inheritance can help, but it only affects process priority; it can force
preemption, but it does not really change task placement or CPU frequency.
Perhaps the kernel could gain a similar mechanism for utilization that
would help for placement, at least, if not CPU frequency.  Schneider
expressed skepticism that such an approach could work well, though.
<p>
An alternative he has been working on is proxy execution: giving the
lock-holding task the waiting task's execution parameters until it lets go
of the lock.  This is a work in progress, he said, that doesn't survive for
more than 20 seconds on real hardware, and it has no provision for futexes
(user-space locks), but it still has some interesting properties, he said.
<p>
With proxy execution, a task that blocks on a mutex is not removed from the
run queue as it would be in a mainline kernel.  It can thus be picked to run by
the scheduler in the usual way if it's the highest-priority task in the
queue.  When 
that happens, though, the lock-holding task inherits the blocked task's
scheduling context.  The blocked task is also migrated to the run queue of
the lock holder, which brings its utilization information over; that will
cause the CPU frequency to be increased, helping the lock holder to get its
work done and release the lock.
<p>
That solves the problem reasonably well on <i>symmetric</i> multiprocessor
systems, but it still falls short on asymmetric systems like big.LITTLE.
To address such systems, Schneider would like to put the
utilization-tracking information into the scheduling context, where it can
be passed more directly to a lock holder.  This has to be done carefully,
though, or it could create priority inversions of its own; if a
low-utilization task is picked to run, it could end up slowing a
high-utilization task.  Making a smart choice is hard, though, since the
utilization signals are highly variable and hard to track in the
proxy-execution code.  The solution might be to ignore the utilization
values and just look at the clamps.
<p>
Juri Lelli asked why this mattered, since the clamp values are already
aggregated on each run queue.  That works for frequency selection,
Schneider answered, but it has no influence on task selection, so it
doesn't help to ensure that the lock-holding task actually runs.
<p>
Then, there is the perennial problem of load balancing.  Utilization
signals are highly useful here, since they let the scheduler ensure that
the load on each CPU is about the same.  But what should be done in the
proxy execution case?  Currently, load-balancing decisions will use the
scheduling context of the donor task (the one waiting for the lock), which
could lead to interesting decisions.  Since contending tasks remain on the
run queue, the apparent load on the CPU increases, which can throw things
off as well.  Peter Zijlstra said that this isn't necessarily a big
problem; one does not expect locks to be held for long periods, so things
should straighten themselves out relatively quickly.
<p>
Patrick Bellasi asked whether just relying on clamp values is sufficient,
or whether the load-tracking signal should be used too.  Schneider
responded that using the clamps really is the best that can be done; there
is no choice.  Utilization values simply change too quickly to be useful.

<p>
Heading toward a conclusion, Schneider said that getting proxy execution
working right is his first priority; presumably rebooting after 20 seconds
of uptime is getting a little tiresome.  He asked whether other developers
were interested in proxy execution as well.  Zijlstra said that he has been
trying to get it to the top of his list for a long time, but has been
"failing miserably".
<p>
Qais Youssef asked how quickly this work might be done.  The next Android
release will not be happening for some time, so it would be nice if there
were some way to fix this problem in the short term.  Could the realtime
mutex code help?  Zijlstra responded that realtime mutexes are really for
realtime processes and won't help with tasks in the completely fair
scheduling class, as most Android tasks are.  We will get the problem
solved when we do, he said.
<p>
The session concluded with numerous developers saying that they would like
to have a working proxy execution mechanism in the kernel, but nobody has
found the time to work on it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hey Jon,<br>
<p>
Thanks a lot for the write-up! One thing perhaps worth clearing up is that I'm only a newcomer to Proxy Execution - for now it's mostly been Peter and Juri's baby.<br>
Juri talked about it at OPSM19 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlu9pC5IL2g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlu9pC5IL2g</a>) and at LPC18 (<a href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/62/">https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/62/</a>).<br>
<p>
Just making sure credit goes where credit is due!<br>

Wow, so with proxy execution, if A sleeps holding a lock and B needs it, A can be scheduled on B's timeslice? (Can it just context-switch directly to B?) That sounds really neat; so neat that I can't immediately understand why it hasn't been done before. Maybe it's because you just shouldn't be sleeping while holding a lock in the first place :-) I wonder if you one could do similar things for condition variables or the likes.<br>

This all seems to suggest that priority should often be a property of the data, not the process. <br>
I don't know if it has been ever tested (a quick googling didn't turn up anything), but it would be interesting to assign priorities to sockets, files, queues or semaphores in addition to/instead of processses.<br>

Assigning priority to data would be equivalent to assigning priority to a critical section.  Data and critical section can both be viewed as a resource with an assigned priority.  The priority ceiling locking protocol (PCP) assigns priorities to mutexes, and hence critical sections.  I believe this was the inspiration for the pthread mutex attr PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT.<br>
<p>
I think a looser coupling of priority from thread of execution makes more sense.  Think of each thread of execution being put in a bucket*, and the CPU scheduler schedules buckets instead of threads.  By default, a new thread/process is put in a new bucket.  When the CPU schedules a bucket, it delegates to the bucket which thread to schedule.  I think this scheme can simplify priority inheritance implementation: a thread inherits a priority by being moved to the bucket of the blocked higher-priority task from which it inherits.  The CPU scheduler doesn't need to know about inheritance, because it only schedules buckets.**<br>
<p>
I believe both MPI/UNC's LitmusRT and CMU's Linux/RK kernels supports these concepts.<br>
<p>
* Literature will call these buckets "servers," but I feel like this term has gotten too overloaded over the years.  Speaking of renaming classic terms, I think proxy execution is simply "bandwidth inheritance."  Is this right?<br>
<p>
** Things can get really crazy when you consider deadline-scheduling.  A bucket that looses CPU time due to donating its CPU time to a thread of another bucket is reciprocated with lower-priority budget of the inheriting thread in exchange.  Because we're talking about deadline-scheduling, this lower-priority budget _may_ become valuable in the future.  The availability of this budget may reduce the need for inheritance actions in the future.  I'm not aware of any implementations of this budget-exchange system.  I think maintaining a ledger of past budget exchanges could be quite complicated.  (I can't find a reference to the academic paper that proposed this scheme.)<br>

<p>
Sounds great, but I guess in practice that's impossible. Especially if it's user space locking resources it needs. Locks are just a nightmare, full stop, but you need them to stop processes trampling over each other.<br>
<p>
That's why they have things like the deadlock killer - if I'm holding a lock you want, and then I try and claim a lock you're holding, one of us is going to get killed ... there's just no easy way to manage locks.<br>

It is, IMO, very neat. The problem is that it's not trivial to decide what to do, on an SMP systems... And, believe me, we thought about just turning CONFIG_SMP off, but we've been told that wouldn't end up well. :-)<br>
<p>
So, imagine that A owns a lock, and that both B and C want it, so they both block on A.<br>
<p>
At this point, A can run:<br>
1) in its own timeslice, and<br>
2) in B's timeslice, and<br>
3) in C's timeslice.<br>
<p>
Which is cool, because being able to run for sooo long, guarantees that A will be quick with the critical section on the lock! So far so good then, we just have to leave both B and C in the runqueue, and when the scheduler picks A, we ran A (of course) but also when the scheduler pick B, we run A and when it picks C, we run A.<br>
<p>
Now, what about we are on a 4 CPUs system and, the scheduler, all at the same time:<br>
- picks A on CPU 0<br>
- picks B on CPU 2<br>
- picks C on CPU 3<br>
<p>
There. We obviously can run A on 3 CPUs at the same time (that would be _really_funny_!! :-D )... And hence you have to deal with a bunch of special cases and the "neatness" rapidly sinks. :-(<br>
<p>
There are solutions, from a theoretical (as in, academic papers) point of view, but they're not the most beautiful to implement in real-world Linux kernel.<br>
<p>
Smart people are looking into solutions, and I'm confident they'll find a way to get around the problems. But yeah, there it is why we're not there yet :-)<br>

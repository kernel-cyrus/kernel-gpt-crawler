Mike Rapoport has put a considerable amount of effort into solving the
problem of direct-map fragmentation over the years; this has resulted in
proposals like <a href="/Articles/926020/"><tt>__GFP_UNMAPPED</tt></a> and
<a href="/Articles/894557/">a session</a> at the 2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit.  Rapoport returned at the <a
href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Summit</a> to revisit this issue, but he
started with a somewhat surprising spoiler.
<p>
The kernel's direct map makes all of the system's physical memory
accessible in the kernel's virtual address space (on 64-bit systems, at
least).  As a performance optimization, huge pages are used to construct
this mapping; by keeping the kernel's use of the translation lookaside
buffer (TLB) down, using huge pages for the direct map will speed memory
access in general.  When the permissions for specific pages in the direct
map must be changed (to hide memory from the kernel or to remove write
permission from executable code, for example), though, those huge pages
must be split into smaller "base" pages, hurting system performance.  This
type of direct-map fragmentation is thus worth working hard to avoid.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/931429/"><img

title="Mike Rapoport" class="lthumb"></a>

Or, at least, that is what everybody has assumed for years.  Rapoport
started his 2023 session with the statement that he is no longer convinced
that the kernel needs to make any changes to its memory allocators to avoid
direct-map fragmentation.  It is, he said, no longer an issue that the
kernel community needs to be concerned about.  "End of the talk".
<p>
The talk didn't actually end there, though.  Instead, he reviewed the
causes of direct-map fragmentation, including the allocation of memory for
executable code (such as a loadable module or a BPF program) or for <a
href="/Articles/865256/">secret-memory features</a>.  Proposed future
changes, such as <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210405203711.1095940-1-rick.p.edgecombe@intel.com/">a
version of <tt>vmalloc()</tt> with memory permissions</a> or using <a
href="/Articles/894531/">protection keys supervisor</a> for page tables,
may also require splitting huge pages and, as a result,  create
fragmentation in the direct map.
<p>
The <tt>__GFP_UNMAPPED</tt> patches tried to reduce this problem by setting
aside an area for allocations that should be removed from the direct
map.  Once those were working, he went looking for numbers to justify the
change.  He ran a whole series of benchmarks to show how the reduced
fragmentation made the system run faster, but got results that he described
as "peculiar".  The results (which he has <a
href="https://rppt.io/gfp-unmapped-bench/">made available</a> for the
curious) showed improvements that were, at best, far smaller than the noise
in the measurements.  There was little sign that any of the changes would
translate into performance improvements for real workloads.
<p>
Vlastimil Babka pointed out that all of the performance tests were done on
AMD CPUs and wondered whether Intel systems would behave differently;
Rapoport answered that he has run the tests on Intel as well with similar
results.  Michal Hocko asked whether Rapoport had run the tests using only
base pages for the direct map — the fully fragmented case, in other words;
that test, too, has been run and showed a "single-digit" degradation in
performance.
<p>
The conclusion from all of this, Rapoport continued, was that direct-map
fragmentation just does not matter — for data access, at least.  Using
huge-page mappings does still appear to make a difference for memory
containing the kernel code, so allocator changes should focus on code
allocations — improving the layout of allocations for loadable modules, for
example, or allowing <tt>vmalloc()</tt> to allocate huge pages for code.
But, for kernel-data allocations, direct-map fragmentation simply
appears to not be worth worrying about.
<p>
James Bottomley said that these results might show that, on current CPUs,
the TLB doesn't work the way developers think it does.  Perhaps improved
speculative execution is reducing the cost of TLB misses; much of the
memory-management subsystem might be built for a world that no longer
exists. Rapoport answered that most of the TLB is occupied by user space
in any case, so the kernel will almost certainly incur a TLB miss on each
entry regardless of the state of the direct map.  Trying
to prevent that miss with large-page mappings may not be doing any good.
<p>
Direct-map fragmentation concerns have led to Rapoport's secret-memory
features to be disabled by default.  Having concluded that those concerns
are not actually concerning, he is now proposing to enable the feature in
all kernels, making <tt>memfd_secret()</tt> available by default.  As the
session ran out of time, Babka worried that fragmentation could still
increase the kernel's memory usage by requiring more page tables, but
Rapoport answered that the cost was not enough to worry about.  Secret
memory is controlled by the system resource limits, so there is only so
much damage that a malicious user can do.
<p>
The proof is likely to be when the configuration change is proposed; if
users can demonstrate real performance regressions, direct-map
fragmentation may have to be reconsidered yet again.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

On arm64, we started mapping the kernel direct map down to pages by default around 5 years ago, and I don't remember seeing any complaints. This was necessary as otherwise, the kernel direct map will have writable aliases of the pages that back module text and rodata regions, which clearly defeats the purpose somewhat of mapping code read-only in the first place.<br>

While huge pages is a noticeable performance improvement in general, it may also slightly decrease performance for some 100% bandwidth bound use-cases, at least on older platforms.  Here's some data about that from enabling THP for Intel iGPUs to compensate performance loss from enabling IOMMU:<br>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/430#note_1042057">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/430#not...</a><br>
<p>
Many years ago I've also seen up to 10% changes in CPU side memory bandwidth test results from just rebooting the machine, which I think have been due to process memory getting allocated at a different address.  Huge pages being split can mean the resulting addresses being less aligned. Maybe that could could improve e.g. cache page coloring (on older platforms)?<br>

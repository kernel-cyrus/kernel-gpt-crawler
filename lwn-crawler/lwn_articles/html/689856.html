<p>
Mount namespaces are a powerful and flexible tool for creating
per-user and per-container filesystem trees.
They are also a surprisingly complex feature;
in this continuation of our series on namespaces
we unravel some of that complexity.
In particular, we will take a close look at the shared subtrees feature,
which allows mount and unmount events to be propagated
between mount namespaces in an automatic, controlled fashion.

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
Mount namespaces were the first namespace type added to Linux,
appearing in 2002 in Linux 2.4.19.
They isolate the list of mount points seen by the processes in a namespace.
Or, to put things another way,
each mount namespace has its own list of mount points,
meaning that processes in different namespaces
see and are able to manipulate
different views of the single directory hierarchy.

<p>
When the system is first booted, there is a single mount namespace,
the so-called "initial namespace".
New mount namespaces are created by using the <tt>CLONE_NEWNS</tt>
flag with either the
<tt><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone()</a></tt>
system call (to create a new child process in the new namespace) or the
<tt><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare()</a></tt>
system call (to move the caller into the new namespace).
When a new mount namespace is created, it receives a copy
of the mount point list replicated from the namespace of the caller of
<tt>clone()</tt>
or
<tt>unshare()</tt>.

<p>
Following the <tt>clone()</tt> or <tt>unshare()</tt> call,
mount points can be independently added and removed in each namespace
(via
<tt><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html">mount()</a></tt>
and
<tt><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umount.2.html">umount()</a></tt>).
Changes to the mount point list are (by default)
visible only to processes in the mount namespace where the process resides;
the changes are not visible in other mount namespaces.

<p>
Mount namespaces serve a variety of purposes.
For example, they can be used to provide
per-user views of the filesystem.
Other uses include
<a href="/Articles/531419/#proc_pid">mounting a <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem for a new PID namespace</a>
without causing side effects for other process
and
<tt>chroot()</tt>-style isolation of a process to a portion of the
single directory hierarchy.
In some use cases, mount namespaces are combined with bind mounts.

<h4>Shared subtrees</h4>

<p>
Once the implementation of mount namespaces was completed,
user-space programmers encountered a usability problem:
mount namespaces provided <em>too much</em>
isolation between namespaces.
Suppose, for example, that a new disk is loaded into an optical disk drive.
In the original implementation, the only way to make that disk
visible in all mount namespaces was to mount the disk separately in each
namespace. 
In many cases, it would instead be preferable to perform
a single mount operation that makes the disk visible in all
(or perhaps some subset) of the mount namespaces on the system.

<p>
Because of the problem just described,
the <a href="/Articles/159077/">shared subtrees feature</a> was added in
Linux 2.6.15 
(in early 2006, around three years after
the initial implementation of mount namespaces).
The key benefit of shared subtrees is to allow automatic,
controlled propagation of mount and unmount events between namespaces.
This means, for example,
that mounting an optical disk in one mount namespace can trigger
a mount of that disk in all other namespaces.

<p>
Under the shared subtrees feature, each mount point is marked
with a "propagation type",
which determines whether mount points
created and removed under this mount point
are propagated to other mount points.
There are four different propagation types:

<ul>
    <p>
    <li>
        <tt>MS_SHARED</tt>:
        This mount point shares mount and unmount events
        with other mount points that are members of its
        "peer group" (which is described in more detail below).
        When a mount point is added or removed
       
        under this mount point,
        this change will propagate to the peer group,
        so that the mount or unmount will also take place under
        each of the peer mount points.
        Propagation also occurs in the reverse direction,
        so that mount and unmount events on a peer mount
        will also propagate to this mount point.
    <p>
    <li>
        <tt>MS_PRIVATE</tt>:
        This is the converse of a shared mount point.
        The mount point does not propagate events to any peers,
        and does not receive propagation events from any peers.
    <p>
    <li>
        <tt>MS_SLAVE</tt>:
        This propagation type sits midway between shared and private.
        A slave mount has a master&mdash;a shared peer group
        whose members propagate mount and unmount events
        to the slave mount.
        However, the slave mount does not propagate events 
        to the master peer group.

    <p>
    <li>
        <tt>MS_UNBINDABLE</tt>: 
        This mount point is unbindable.
        Like a private mount point,
        this mount point does not propagate events to or from peers.
        In addition, this mount point can't be the source for
        a bind mount operation.
</ul>

<p>
It's worth expanding on a few points that were glossed over above.
The first is that the propagation type is a per-mount-point setting.
Within a namespace, some mount points might be marked shared,
while others are marked private (or slave or unbindable).

<p>
The second point to emphasize is that the propagation type determines
the propagation of mount and unmount events <em>immediately under</em>
the mount point.
Thus, if, under a shared mount, X, we create a child mount, Y,
that child mount will propagate to other mount points in the peer group.
However, the propagation type of X would have no effect for mount
points created and removed under Y; whether or not events under Y
are propagated would depend on the propagation type that is defined for Y.
Analogously, whether an unmount event would be propagated when X itself
is unmounted would depend on the propagation type of the parent mount of X.

<p>
In passing, it is perhaps worth clarifying that the word "event"
is used here as an abstract term, in the sense of "something happened".
The notion of event propagation does not imply some sort of message
passing between mount points. Rather, it carries the idea that some
mount or unmount operation on one mount point triggered a matching
operation one or more other mount points.

<p>
Finally, it is possible for a mount to be both the slave
of a master peer group as well as sharing events with a set of peers
of its own&mdash;a so-called slave-and-shared mount.
In this case,
the mount might receive propagation events from the master,
and those events would then be propagated to its peers.

<h4>Peer groups</h4>

<p>
A peer group is a set of mount points that propagate
mount and unmount events to one another.
A peer group acquires new members when a mount point whose propagation
type is shared is either replicated during the creation of
a new namespace or is used as the source for a bind mount.
(For a bind mount, the details are more complex than we describe here;
details can be found in the kernel source file
<tt><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt">Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt</a></tt>.)
In both cases, the new mount point is made a member
of the same peer group as the existing mount point.
Conversely, a mount point ceases to be a member of a peer group when
it is unmounted, either explicitly, or implicitly when a mount namespace
is torn down because the last member process terminates or
moves to another namespace.

<p>
For example, suppose that in a shell running in the initial mount namespace,
we make the root mount point private and create two shared mount points:

<pre>
    sh1# <strong>mount --make-private /</strong>
    sh1# <strong>mount --make-shared /dev/sda3 /X</strong>
    sh1# <strong>mount --make-shared /dev/sda5 /Y</strong>
</pre>

<p>
As indicated by the "<tt>#</tt>" in the shell prompts,
privilege is required for the various
<tt>mount</tt> commands that we employ in
the example shell sessions to create mount points and change
their propagation types.

<p>
Then, on a second terminal,
we use the <tt>unshare</tt> command to
create a new mount namespace where we run a shell:

<pre>
    sh2# <strong>unshare -m --propagation unchanged sh</strong>
</pre>

<p>
(The <tt>-m</tt> option creates a new mount namespace; the purpose of the
<tt>--propagation&nbsp;unchanged</tt> 
option is explained later.)

<p>
Returning to the first terminal, we then create a bind mount from the
<tt>/X</tt> mount point:

<pre>
    sh1# <strong>mkdir /Z</strong>
    sh1# <strong>mount --bind /X /Z</strong>
</pre>

<p>
Following these steps, we have the situation shown in the diagram below.

<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2016/mountns_peer_groups.svg" alt="[Shared mount point
peer groups example]" width=480 height=240> 
</center>

<p>
In this scenario, there are two peer groups:

<ul>
    <p>
    <li>
        The first peer group contains the mount points X,
        X' (the duplicate of mount point X that was created when
        the second namespace was created), and Z (the bind mount
        created from the source mount point X in the initial namespace).
    <p>
    <li>
        The second peer group contains the mount points Y and
        Y' (the duplicate of mount point Y that was created when
        the second namespace was created).
</ul>
<p>
Note that the bind mount Z, which was created in the initial namespace
        <em>after</em> the second namespace was created,
        was not replicated in the second namespace because the parent mount
        (<tt>/</tt>) was marked private.

<h4>Examining propagation types and peer groups via <tt>/proc/PID/mountinfo</tt></h4>

<p>
The <tt>/proc/PID/mountinfo</tt> file (documented in the
<tt><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a></tt>
manual page) displays a range of information
about the mount points for the mount namespace in which the
process <tt>PID</tt> resides.
All processes that reside in the same mount namespace
will see the same view in this file.
This file was designed to provide more information about mount points
than was possible with the older, non-extensible
<tt>/proc/PID/mounts</tt> file.
Included in each record in this file is a (possibly empty) set
of so-called "optional fields", which display information about the
propagation type and peer group (for shared mounts) of each mount.

<p>
For a shared mount, the optional fields in
the corresponding record in <tt>/proc/PID/mountinfo</tt>
will contain a tag of the form <tt>shared:N</tt>.
Here, the <tt>shared</tt> tag indicates that the mount is
sharing propagation events with a peer group.
The peer group is identified by <tt>N</tt>, an integer value
that uniquely identifies the peer group.
These IDs are numbered starting at 1,
and may be recycled when a peer group ceases to exist
because all of its members departed the group.
All mount points that are members of the same peer group
will show a <tt>shared:N</tt> tag with the same <tt>N</tt>
in the <tt>/proc/PID/mountinfo</tt> file.

<p>
Thus for example, if we list the contents of <tt>/proc/self/mountinfo</tt>
in the first of the shells discussed in the example above,
we see the following (with a little bit of <tt>sed</tt> filtering
to trim some irrelevant information from the output):

<pre>
    sh1# <strong>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | sed 's/ - .*//'</strong>
    61 0 8:2 / / rw,relatime
    81 61 8:3 / /X rw,relatime shared:1
    124 61 8:5 / /Y rw,relatime shared:2
    228 61 8:3 / /Z rw,relatime shared:1
</pre>

<p>
From this output, we first see that the root mount point is private.
This is indicated by the absence of any tags in the optional fields.
We also see that the mount points <tt>/X</tt> and <tt>/Z</tt>
are shared mount points in the same peer group (with ID 1),
which means that mount and unmount events under either
of these two mounts will propagate to the other.
The mount <tt>/Y</tt> is a shared mount in a different peer group (ID 2),
which, by definition, does not propagate events to or from
the mounts in peer group 1.

<p>
The <tt>/proc/PID/mountinfo</tt> file also enables us to see the
parental relationship between mount points.
The first field in each record is a unique ID for each mount point.
The second field is the ID for the parent mount.
From the above output, we can see that the mount points
<tt>/X</tt>, <tt>/Y</tt>, and <tt>/Z</tt>
are all children of the root mount because their parent IDs are all 61.

<p>
Running the same command
in the second shell (in the second namespace), we see:

<pre>
    sh2# <strong>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | sed 's/ - .*//'</strong>
    147 146 8:2 / / rw,relatime
    221 147 8:3 / /X rw,relatime shared:1
    224 147 8:5 / /Y rw,relatime shared:2
</pre>

<p>
Again, we see that the root mount point is private.
Then we see that <tt>/X</tt> is a shared mount in peer group 1,
the same peer group as the mounts <tt>/X</tt> and <tt>/Z</tt>
in the initial mount namespace.
Finally, we see that <tt>/Y</tt> is a shared mount in peer group 2,
the same peer group as the mount <tt>/Y</tt>
in the initial mount namespace.
One final point to note is that the mount points that were
replicated in the second namespace have their own unique IDs
that differ from the IDs of the corresponding mounts in the
initial namespace.

<h4>Debating defaults</h4>

<p>
Because the situation is a little complex, we have so far avoided
discussing what the default propagation type is for a new mount point.
From the kernel's perspective,
the default when a new device mount is created is as follows:

<ul>
    <p>
    <li>
        If the mount point has a parent
        (i.e., it is a non-root mount point)
        and the propagation type of the parent is <tt>MS_SHARED</tt>,
        then the propagation type of the new mount is also
        <tt>MS_SHARED</tt>.
    <p>
    <li>
        Otherwise, the propagation type of the new mount
        is <tt>MS_PRIVATE</tt>.
</ul>

<p>
According to these rules, the root mount would be <tt>MS_PRIVATE</tt>,
and all descendant mounts would by default also be <tt>MS_PRIVATE</tt>.
However, <tt>MS_SHARED</tt> would arguably have been a better default,
since it is the more commonly employed propagation type.
For that reason, <tt>systemd</tt> sets the propagation type
of all mount points to <tt>MS_SHARED</tt>.
Thus, on most modern Linux distributions,
the default propagation type is effectively <tt>MS_SHARED</tt>.
This is not the final word on the subject, however,
since the util-linux <tt>unshare</tt> utility also has something to say.
When creating a new mount namespace,
<tt>unshare</tt>
assumes that the user wants a fully isolated namespace,
and makes all mount points private by performing the equivalent
of the following command (which
recursively marks all mounts under the root directory as private):

<pre>
    mount --make-rprivate /
</pre>

<p>
To prevent this, we can use an additional option when creating the new
namespace:

<pre>
    unshare -m --propagation unchanged &lt;cmd&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Concluding remarks</h4>

<p>
In this article, we introduced the "theory" of mount namespaces
and shared subtrees.
We now have enough information to demonstrate and
understand the semantics of the various propagation types;
that will be the subject of a follow-on article.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The "shared" mode is probably a nicer default but it breaks <code>mount --move</code> as a side effect, so I've seen a few complaints when this was first added to systemd.

It took me forever to debug this problem, and only after reading this LWN article did I finally figure out why my computer would crash whenever I enabled "systemd".<br>
<p>
I have a cron job that uses "bup" to create regular snapshots of the entire filesystem. I then mount the most recent backup on "/backup". This way, I can easily recover from accidentally deleting important files or from accidentally breaking things when I make poorly conceived changes to configuration files.<br>

For additional convenience, I also bind-mount things like "/proc" and "/dev" into this snapshot. This allows me to "chroot" into "/backup", whenever I want to see how things changed with my edits. It's been working like this for years, and the extra safety net gives great peace of mind.<br>
<p>
Turns out, the new "systemd" policy for shared mounts means that umounting "/backup/dev/pts" also automatically unmounts the global "/dev/pts". And that has devastating effects. The system only survives very briefly afterwards.<br>
<p>
I have a really hard time seeing how this behavior can ever be desirable for bind mounts (most notably for the "rbind" variety).<br>

So, I got into this article because it was linked from &quot;unprivileged chroot&quot; as allegedly covering most of its usecases. Sounds nice to me: at work I&#x27;m just trying to solve the problem of root required to build a system image (specifically it is running `chroot` from non-root that&#x27;s causing the problem).<br>
<p>
Okay, so I read through this article, and it even has this mention:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Other uses include […] chroot()-style isolation of a process to a portion of the single directory hierarchy</font><br>
<p>
How? I read through the whole article, and not only I don&#x27;t get how to do it unpriveleged (all commands here explicitly mention root) — in fact, I don&#x27;t even see an example of isolating a command to a new root.<br>

      Oh, I found in the other article, the command I was searching for is:
<pre><code>
unshare -mr chroot ~/Projects/an-alternative-root-dir /bin/bash
</code></pre>

This article prefixes the <code>unshare</code> command with <code>#</code> making it look as if you need root priviledges, but actually you don't need to run it as root. Running the above command as a usual user worked for me.

Actually, the -r command in your command will create a new user namespace, and map your user ID to 0 (root) in this user namespace. That is why you can run chroot &quot;without&quot; root.<br>
<p>
As mentioned in this article (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/">https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/</a>), starting with Linux 3.8, no privilege is required to create a new user namespace.<br>

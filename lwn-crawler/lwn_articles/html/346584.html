<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>August 12, 2009</br>
           </div>
<p>
As part of the changes to support application <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/293575/">checkpoint and restart</a> in the
kernel, Sukadev Bhattiprolu has <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/345843/">proposed</a> a new system call:
<tt>clone_with_pids()</tt>.  When a process that was checkpointed gets
restarted, having the same process id (PID) as it had when the checkpoint
was done is important to some kinds of applications. Normally, the kernel
assigns an unused PID 
when a new task is started (via <tt>clone()</tt>), but, for checkpointed
processes, that could lead to 
processes' PIDs changing during their lifetime, which could be an
undesirable side effect.  So, Bhattiprolu is looking for a way to avoid
that by allowing <tt>clone()</tt> callers to specify the
PID&mdash;or PIDs for processes in nested
namespaces&mdash;of the child.
</p>

<p>
The actual system call is fairly straightforward.  It adds an additional
<tt>pid_set</tt> parameter to <tt>clone()</tt>, to contain a list of
process ids; <tt>pid_set</tt> has the obvious definition:
<pre>
    struct pid_set {
	   int num_pids;
	   pid_t *pids;
    };
</pre>
A pointer to a <tt>pid_set</tt> is passed as the last parameter to
<tt>clone_with_pids()</tt>.  Each of the PIDs is used to specify
which PID should be assigned at each level of namespace nesting.
The patch that actually implements <tt>clone_with_pids()</tt> (as opposed
to the earlier patches in the patchset that prepare the way)
<a href="/Articles/346627/">illustrates</a> this with an example (slightly
edited for clarity):
<div class="BigQuote">
<pre>
	pid_t pids[] = { 0, 77, 99 };
	struct pid_set pid_set;

	pid_set.num_pids = sizeof(pids) / sizeof(int);
	pid_set.pids = &amp;pids;

	clone_with_pids(flags, stack, NULL, NULL, NULL, &amp;pid_set);
</pre>
If a target-pid is 0, the kernel continues to assign a pid for the process in
that namespace. In the above example, pids[0] is 0, meaning the kernel will
assign next available pid to the process in init_pid_ns. But kernel will assign
pid 77 in the child pid namespace 1 and pid 99 in pid namespace 2. If either
77 or 99 are taken, the system call fails with -EBUSY.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The patchset assumes that being able to set PIDs is desirable, but
  Linus Torvalds was
not particularly in favor of that approach when it was first <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324254/">discussed</a> on linux-kernel back
in March.  His complaint was that there are far too many stateful
attributes of processes to ever be able to handle checkpointing in the
general case.  His suggestion: "<q>just teach the damn program 
     you're checkpointing that pids will change, and admit to everybody 
     that people who want to be checkpointed need to do work</q>".
</p>

<p> Others disagreed&mdash;no surprise&mdash;but it is unclear that
Torvalds has changed his mind.  He was also concerned about the security
implications of processes being able to request PID assignments:
"<q>But it also sounds like a _wonderful_ attack vector against badly
written user-land software that sends signals and has small races.</q>"
That particular concern should be alleviated by the requirement that a
process have the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability (essentially root
privileges) in order to use <tt>clone_with_pids()</tt>.  

<p>
Requiring root to
handle restarts, which in practice means that root must manage the checkpoint
process as well, makes checkpoint/restart less useful, overall.  But there
are a whole host of problems to solve before allowing users to arbitrarily
checkpoint and restore from their own, quite possibly maliciously crafted,
checkpoint images.  Even with root handling the process, there are a number
of interesting applications.</p>

<p>
There is an additional wrinkle that Bhattiprolu notes in the patch.
Currently, all of the available <tt>clone()</tt> flags are allocated.  That
doesn't affect <tt>clone_with_pids()</tt> directly, as the flags it needs
are already present, but, when adding a system call, it is good to look
to the future.  To that end, there are two proposed implementations of
a <tt>clone_extended()</tt> system call, which could be added instead of
<tt>clone_with_pids()</tt>, that would allow for more
<tt>clone()</tt> flags, while still supporting the restart case.
</p>

<p>
The first possibility is to turn the <tt>flags</tt> argument into a pointer
to an array of flag entries, that would be treated like <tt>signal()</tt>
sets, including operations to test, set, and clear flags <i>a la</i>
<tt>sigsetops()</tt>:
<pre>
    typedef struct {
	    unsigned long flags[CLONE_FLAGS_WORDS];
    } clone_flags_t;

    int clone_extended(clone_flags_t *flags, void *child_stack, int *unused,
	    int *parent_tid, int *child_tid, struct pid_set *pid_set);
</pre>

In the proposal, <tt>CLONE_FLAGS_WORDS</tt> would be set to 1 for 64-bit
architectures, 
while on 32-bit architectures, it would be set to 2, thus doubling the
number of available flags to 64.  Should the number of clone flags needed
grow, that could be expanded as required, though doing so in a
backward-compatible manner is not really possible.
</p>

<p>
Another option is to split the flags into two parameters, keeping the
current <tt>flags</tt> parameter as it is, and adding a new
<tt>clone_info</tt> parameter that contains new flags along with the
<tt>pid_set</tt>: 
<pre>
    struct clone_info {
	    int num_clone_high_words;
	    int *flags_high;
	    struct pid_set pid_set;
    }

    int clone_extended(int flags_low, void *child_stack, void *unused,
	    int *parent_tid, int *child_tid, struct clone_info *clone_info);
</pre>

There are pros and cons to each approach, as Bhattiprolu points out.  The
first requires a <tt>copy_from_user()</tt> for the flags in all cases
(though 64-bit architectures might be able to avoid that for now), while
the second requires the awkward splitting of the flags, but avoids the
<tt>copy_from_user()</tt> for calls that don't use the new flags or
<tt>pid_set</tt>s.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to imagine that copying a bit of data from user space will
measurably impact a system call that is creating a process, though, so some
derivative of the first option would seem to be the better choice.  It's
also a bit hard to see the need for more than 64 <tt>clone()</tt> flags,
but if that is truly desired, something with a path for compatibility is
needed. 
</p>

<p> There has been no objection to the implementation of
<tt>clone_with_pids()</tt>, but there have been few comments overall.
Pavel Machek <a href="/Articles/346677/">wondered</a> about the need for
setting the PID of anything but the inner-most namespace, but
Serge E. Hallyn <a href="/Articles/346678/">noted</a> that nested
namespaces require that ability: "<q>we might be restarting an app
using a nested pid namespace, in which case restart would specify pids for
2 (or more) of the innermost containers</q>".</p>

<p>
Machek also thought there should be a documentation file that described the
new system call, and Bhattiprolu agreed, but is waiting to see what kind of
consensus on either <tt>clone_with_pids()</tt> or <tt>clone_extended()</tt>
(and which of the two interfaces for the latter) would emerge.  So far, no
one has commented on that particular aspect.
<p>

<p>
This
is version 4 of the patchset, and the history shows that earlier comments
have been addressed.  It is still at the RFC stage, or, as
Bhattiprolu puts it: "<q>Its mostly an exploratory patch seeking
feedback on the interface</q>".  That feedback has yet to emerge,
however, and one might wonder whether Torvalds will still object to the
whole approach.  It would seem, though, that there are too many important
applications for checkpoint and restart&mdash;including process migration
and the ability to upgrade kernels underneath long-running
processes&mdash;for some kind of solution not to make its way into the
kernel eventually.

<p>Doesn't that make the (possibly wrong) assumption that <code>pid_t</code> is an <code>int</code> in setting <code>pid_set.num_pids</code>? Or perhaps I'm being naive and it's been too long since I did this kind of stuff.</p>

IMHO you are right. sizeof(pids) / sizeof(pid_t) would be the right thing, or better yet sizeof(pids) / sizeof(*pids), or with the appropriate macro: ARRAY_SIZE(pids).<br>

      Yes, but that is not a problem of <tt>ARRAY_SIZE</tt> or <tt>sizeof</tt> itself, but a PEBKAC. Using fct(<b>unsigned int *</b>array) instead of fct(<b>unsigned int</b> array<b>[</b>4<b>]</b>), preferably consistently, should give yourself a reminder how C works.

<p>
Sure it is.  It's just a matter of perspective.  That ARRAY_SIZE(array) doesn't do what the user thinks it does can just as easily be called a problem with ARRAY_SIZE (I said problem, not bug) as with the user.  In a <em>nice</em> language, array sizes would work the way a coder who hasn't already been bitten by this a few times would expect.  Degeneration of an array to a pointer, though quite traditional in C, is a problem.

The BSD sockets API are the best example of extensible syscall interfaces.  In fact, only the name resolution stuff (separate from the sockets itself) have needed to be replaced since the official inception of sockets.<br>
<p>
Basically, instead of defining a ton of parameters, define a structure that is passed in.  Either pass in a version of the structure or the structure size (which grows with additions).  Then adding new data never requires breaking the syscall interface itself.<br>
<p>
There is a performance hit for small syscalls, but then one doesn't have to do all or nothing.  A syscall can include the common bits as regular parameters and just use the structure for extension data.<br>

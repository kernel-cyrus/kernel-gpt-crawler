LWN's <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2009/">2009 Kernel Summit coverage</a>
</div>
At last year's kernel summit, the perf events subsystem did not yet exist,
even in out-of-tree form.  Now, this subsystem (initially called "perf
counters") is in the mainline and rapidly gaining new capabilities.  Paul
Mackerras led a discussion on recent and future developments for this code.
<p>
The perf counters code brought with it the <tt>perf_counter_open()</tt>
system call.  Unlike previous work in this area, perf counters deals with
single counters at a time, rather than presenting a view of the entire
performance measurement unit (PMU) in the processor.  Since being merged, this
code has gained the ability to treat tracepoints as software events, 
collect user stack chains, perform filtering with C-like expressions, and
work with kprobes.  It also has been rebranded "perf events" to highlight
its expanding scope.
<p>
What does the future hold?  One is better scheduling of counters.  A
typical hardware PMU can only measure a subset of all the possible events
at any given time.  If an application asks for more events than the PMU can
handle, the kernel will simulate a larger PMU by having it count
different events at different times.  This scheduling of the PMU works, but
it would be nice to have better control.  User space should be able to
attach priorities to counters, indicating which ones it really cares
about.  It would also be nice to be able to modify the scheduling interval
used.
<p>
Internally, there needs to be a well-defined API for users of the perf
events subsystem.  Support for more architectures is in the works;
currently recent x86, server PowerPC, and SPARC64 processors are
supported.  Also desired is the ability to combine multiple counters to
create abstract events.
<p>
Currently the kernel has a number of ways to report events to user space.
It seems that at least some of the developers working in this area would
like perf events to subsume the others and become the one true event
counting and reporting infrastructure.  If this happens, ftrace would lose
its ring buffer implementation and report its data through the (different)
ring buffer used by perf events.  There was no real opposition to this
idea; nobody was willing to take the position that having duplicated ring
buffer implementations in the kernel was a good idea.  The fact that the
author of the ftrace ring buffer was not present may also have contributed
to the silence on this issue.
<p>
There was some talk of working with user-space tracepoints.  How should
data from these tracepoints be integrated with kernel tracing data?  One
idea was to make some sort of <tt>inject_tracepoint()</tt> system call, but
that was dismissed as being too slow.  If user-space tracing data needs to
go through the kernel, some sort of inbound ring buffer needs to be
implemented.
<p>
An alternative would be to record user-space trace data separately, then
integrate it during postprocessing.  The problem here is that it is
surprisingly difficult to timestamp this data in a way that allows it to be
reliably merged with kernel trace data.  In the end, it may be necessary to
just record trace information with CPU numbers and time stamp counter
contents.
<p>
There are also issues with the collection of backtrace information from
user space.  That is apparently hard to do if user space has not been built
with frame pointers.  But, on some architectures, using frame pointers has
a serious performance cost, so most distributors are unwilling to build
their systems that way.  There was some debate over whether it's possible
to reliably generate backtraces without frame pointer information, but no
clear conclusion.
<p>
The following session covered the related issue of tracepoints and
user-space ABI issues.  Tracepoint documentation was covered; all of those
tracepoints are not as useful as they could be if they are not properly
documented.  There is an effort underway to document tracepoints in the
kerneldoc system, but that was criticized as being the wrong approach.
What is really needed, people said, was self-documenting tracepoints.  The
documentation could be put into a special kernel section, in the same way
as module author and parameter information is stored now.  The
documentation could be extracted by tools when needed.  That would require
keeping an uncompressed kernel image around, but that is often necessary
anyway.
<p>
What about tracepoint stability?  As developers discover tracepoints, they
will create tools that rely on them; changing the tracepoints will then
break the tools.  Arjan van de Ven made the point that, without some sort
of tracepoint stability, these tools would quickly become useless.  So, at
some level, tracepoints need to be seen as part of the kernel ABI.
<p>
There is little appetite for casting every kernel tracepoint in cement,
though; many (or most) of them are really just debugging aids for
developers.  So what is needed is a way to mark some tracepoints as being
part of the stable ABI.  It was asserted that this marking must be done in
the code itself; that way developers will see the ABI status of a given
tracepoint and avoid changing it.  Presumably something like Arjan's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/354865/">TRACE_EVENT_ABI</a> patch would be
used.
<p>
These sessions also included a quick demonstration of the <tt>ftrace</tt>,
<tt>perf</tt>, and timechart tools.  The demonstrations were interesting
but not really amenable to a writeup here.  The best thing for interested
developers to do is to read the documentation and LWN articles about these
tools and play with them for a while.

Note, as the author of the ftrace ring buffer, there's no reason that perf can not use the ftrace ring buffer as well. I hate calling it the "ftrace ring buffer" since it was made specifically as a separate entity.<br>
<p>
I guess it is time to write up some patches and make perf use it ;-)<br>

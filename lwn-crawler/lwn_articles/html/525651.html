At any level of the system, from the hardware to high-level applications,
performance often depends on keeping frequently-used data in a place
where it can be accessed quickly.  That is the principle behind hardware
caches, virtual memory, and web-browser image caches, for example.  The
kernel already tries to 
keep useful filesystem data in the page cache for quick access, but there
can also be advantages to keeping track of "hot" data at the filesystem
level and treating it specially.  In 2010, a <a
href="/Articles/398503/">data temperature tracking patch set</a>
for the Btrfs filesystem was posted, but then faded from view.  Now the
idea has returned as a more general solution.

The current form of the patch set, posted by Zhi Yong Wu, is called <a
href="/Articles/525425/">hot-data tracking</a>.  It works at the virtual
filesystem (VFS) level, tracking accesses to data and making the resulting
information available to user space via a couple of mechanisms.  

<p>
The first step is the instrumentation of the VFS to obtain the needed
information.  To that
end, Zhi Yong's patch set adds hooks to a number of core VFS functions
(<tt>__blockdev_direct_IO()</tt>, <tt>readpage()</tt>,
<tt>read_pages()</tt>, and <tt>do_writepages()</tt>) to record specific
access operations.  It is worth noting that hooking at this level means
that this subsystem is not tracking data accesses as such; instead, it is
tracking operations that cause actual file I/O.  The two are not quite
the same thing: a frequently-read page that remains in the page cache will
generate no I/O; it could look quite cold to the hot-data tracking code.
<p>
The patch set uses these hooks to maintain a surprisingly complicated data
structure, involving a couple of red-black trees, that is hooked into a
filesystem's <tt>superblock</tt> structure.  Zhi Yong used this bit of
impressive ASCII art to describe it in the <a
href="/Articles/525652/">documentation file</a> included with the patch
set:

<p>
In short, the idea is to track which inodes are seeing the most I/O
traffic, along with the hottest data ranges within those inodes.  The
subsystem can produce a sorted list on demand.  Unsurprisingly, this data
structure can end up using a lot of memory on a busy system, so Zhi Yong
has added a shrinker to clean things up when space gets tight.  Specific
file information is also dropped after five minutes (by default) with no
activity.
<p>
There is a new <tt>ioctl()</tt> command (<tt>FS_IOC_GET_HEAT_INFO</tt>)
that can be used to obtain the relevant information for a specific file.
The structure it uses shows the information that is available:
<p>
<pre>
    struct hot_heat_info {
	__u64 avg_delta_reads;
	__u64 avg_delta_writes;
	__u64 last_read_time;
	__u64 last_write_time;
	__u32 num_reads;
	__u32 num_writes;
	__u32 temp;
	__u8 live;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The hot-data tracking subsystem monitors the number of read and write
operations, when the 
last operations occurred, and the average period between operations.  A
<a href="/Articles/525843/">complicated calculation</a> boils all that
information down to a single 
temperature value, stored in <tt>temp</tt>.  The <tt>live</tt> field is an
input parameter to the <tt>ioctl()</tt> call: if it is non-zero, the
temperature will be recalculated at the time of the call; otherwise a
cached, previously-calculated value will be returned.
<p>
The <tt>ioctl()</tt> call does not provide a way to query which parts of
the file are the hottest, or to get a list of the hottest files.  Instead,
the debugfs interface must be used.  Once debugfs is mounted, each 
device or partition with a mounted filesystem will be represented by a
directory under <tt>hot_track/</tt> 
containing two files.  The most active files can be found by reading
<tt>rt_stats_inode</tt>, while the hottest file ranges can be read from
<tt>rt_stats_range</tt>.  These are the interfaces that user-space
utilities are expected to use to make decisions about, for example, which
files (or portions of files) should be stored on a fast, solid-state drive.
<p>
Should a filesystem want to influence how the calculations are done, the
patch set provides a structure (called <tt>hot_func_ops</tt>) as a place for
filesystem-provided functions to calculate access frequencies,
temperatures, and when information should be aged out of the system.  In
the posted patch set, though, only Btrfs uses the hot-data tracking
feature, and it does not override any of those operations, so it is not
entirely clear why they exist.  The changelog states that support for ext4
and xfs has been implemented; perhaps one of those filesystems needed that
capability.
<p>
The patch set has been through several review cycles and a lot of changes
have been made in response to comments.  The list of things still to be
done includes scalability 
testing, a simpler temperature calculation function, and the ability to
save file temperature data across an unmount.  If nothing else, some solid
performance information will be required before this patch set can be
merged into the core VFS code.  So hot-data tracking is not 3.8 material,
but it may be ready for one of the subsequent development cycles.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The kernel's <a href="/Articles/604609/">control-group mechanism</a> allows
processes to be divided into groups for the purposes of tracking and
resource control.  Both the API and underlying implementation of this
mechanism have been going through considerable
change in recent years.  As part of that change, the newer
control-group API has lost the ability to separately manage threads within
a process, a loss that is not welcome in some quarters.  Current work to
replace that functionality is not finding an entirely warm reception
either, though.
<p>
<h4>No threads need apply</h4>
<p>
Within the kernel, the distinction between a "thread" and a "process" is
not entirely clear; for the most part, everything that can run is just a
thread.  At the user level, though, the two are seen as separate, with
processes having their own address space while threads share a single
address space (to oversimplify things slightly).  Within the kernel, the
"everything is a thread" notion led to the first version of the
control-group interface (the "v1 API") managing everything at the thread level.
<p>
When control-group maintainer Tejun Heo designed the new (v2)
control-group interface, one of the key changes he made is that the 
individual threads that make up a process cannot be assigned to different
groups; the entire process is assigned (or moved) as a unit.  This
restriction comes about for a couple of reasons:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Many of the resources managed by control groups belong to the process
     as a whole; think about memory usage in a setting where all threads
     share the same address space, for example.  Putting different threads
     into different control groups makes it impossible to say what the
     memory-usage policy actually is.  Bringing in multiple controllers
     with overlapping responsibilities — memory and I/O bandwidth, for
     example — muddies the picture even further.  By keeping threads
     together (and in a single group hierarchy as well, another change made
     by the v2 API) the new mechanism
     makes a coherent resource-management policy possible.
<p>
<li> Control groups are seen to be a mechanism by which the system
     administrator can manage resources, and the API is designed around
     that use case.  Resource management for threads, though, is more of a
     concern for an application itself rather than the administrator.
     Using the same interface for both is seen as conflating two use cases,
     creating possible security issues, and leading to possible performance
     problems — an API designed for occasional use by administrators may
     not perform well if an application uses it to make frequent changes.
     <p>
     Additionally, in the v1 API,
     giving a process access to a portion of the virtual filesystem tree
     used to manage control groups requires the intervention of an outside
     process, possibly leading to a situation where applications have to be
     written for any management scheme that distributions may adopt.  Tejun
     sees that as a cost imposed by the kernel's failure to provide a
     proper interface for this type of control.
</ul>
<p>
Limiting control groups to processes steps around all of these problems
without, it was thought, creating any new ones.  But there are indeed use
cases for managing resources at the thread level.  Most of those use cases
seem to be oriented around scheduling; an application may well want to use
control groups to manage the division of its available CPU time among its
component threads.  In the v2 API, that ability has been lost.
<p>
<h4>Enter resource groups</h4>
<p>
Tejun has been pondering the thread-level control problem for
a while now.  In early January he posted <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cgroups/15225">a lengthy
writeup</a> of what he intended to do, but got no responses.  That is often
the case in kernel development; developers would rather see the code than a
lot of words about what somebody intends to do.  Besides, many were
probably still recovering from their new-year hangovers on January&nbsp;5.
So the real discussion had to wait for the posting of Tejun's <a
href="/Articles/679774/">"resource group" mechanism patch set</a> in
March.
<p>
A "resource group" can be thought of as a special kind of control group
designed for use within a process to control its own threads.  They are
thus distinct from "system groups," which are control groups as implemented
in current kernels.  Tejun uses the terms "rgroup" and "sgroup" for those
two types of groups, but that leads to language like "<q>a top-level
rgroup of a process is a rgroup whose parent cgroup is a sgroup,</q>" so
it might be better to spell things out.
<p>
Unlike control groups, resource groups are essentially invisible; they
cannot be managed with the regular control-group API.  That is done, in
part, to separate the management interfaces, but it is also done because
there is quite a bit less management to be done with resource groups.  A
process may be moved from one control group (system group) to another at
any time, but resource-group membership for threads is forever.  Among
other things, 
that addresses the performance issues that can come from frequent group
changes: if such changes cannot be done, the performance problems go away.
<p>
Resource-group membership is managed, instead, at process-creation time via
a new flag (<tt>CLONE_NEWRGRP</tt>) to the <tt>clone()</tt> system call.  A
thread thus can never change its own resource-group membership, but it can
create new threads in a different group.  Thus resource groups, unlike
system groups, can only cover specific subtrees of the process tree.
<p>
Controllers ordinarily operate on system groups only, but they can be made
available at the resource-group level as well.  Tejun's patch set does that
for only one controller: the CPU (scheduling) controller.  This controller
is enabled on a specific resource group by calling <tt>setpriority()</tt>
with the new <tt>PRIO_RGRP</tt> flag.  For the top-level resource groups
within a process, the priority can only be set as high as the priority of
the process itself.  Lower-level resource groups can have any priority,
since they only affect the relative scheduling within the group itself.
<p>
Scheduling of resource groups works the same way it does with system
groups.  If a given system group contains two processes and a resource
group with a few processes of its own, the CPU time given to the system
group will, by default, be divided in three and split equally among those
two processes and that one resource group.  All of the threads within the
resource group will then contend for that one-third of the available CPU
time allotted to the group.
<p>
Another area of interest for thread-level control is the "cpuset" mechanism
that allows threads to be restricted to specific CPUs.  Tejun has chosen
not to address this problem quite yet; as he said in January:
"<q>cpuset can also benefit from thread granularity; however,
the situation around cpuset is murkier, so let's stay away from it for
now.</q>"  A dive into the murk will eventually become necessary, but
there are enough thorny issues to deal with even without addressing the
cpuset problem.
<p>
<h4>On the existence of processes</h4>
<p>
Like many other aspects of the control-group refactoring, the
resource-group patches are going to have to overcome some resistance before
getting into the mainline kernel.  Mike Galbraith <a
href="/Articles/679958/">led the resistance</a> in this case by complaining
that the scheduler has no notion of processes.  Everything there is just a
<tt>sched_entity</tt> structure that can represent either a thread or a
(system) control group.  According to Mike, pushing the "process" concept
into the scheduler is not a good idea.  He is particularly concerned about
the inability to move threads between resource groups, citing the
thread-pool use case where threads do work for different users (and thus
should run in different groups) over their lifetime.  Ingo Molnar <a
href="/Articles/679959/">took the criticism further</a>, accusing Tejun of
ignoring concerns that have been expressed in the past and pushing forward
with a problematic design.
<p>
Tejun <a href="/Articles/679960/">responded</a> that the resource-group
patch set is his attempt to address the concerns that have been raised,
most of which had to do with the loss of thread-level management.  The
scheduler may not recognize processes as such, but users do.  So, he said,
a process is a good place to separate system-level administration from
user-level control:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Decoupling system management and in-application operations makes
  	hierarchical resource grouping and control easily accessible to
  	individual applications without worrying about how the system is
  	managed in larger scope.  Process is a fairly good approximation of
  	this boundary.
</div>
<p>
Beyond that, he said, for some resources it makes no sense to go below the
process level.
<p>
For the thread-group use case, he said, the best solution remains to put
the CPU controller on a separate system-group hierarchy.  That remains
possible with the v1 API, and that capability is not going away
anytime soon.  But, he noted, doing so sacrifices the ability to manage all
resources in a unified manner.  In <a href="/Articles/679961/">another
response</a> he described this organization as "<q>completely alien to
how the rest of the system is organized</q>"; such modes can be useful,
and they will remain supported, but there will be costs to using them.
<p>

Part of Mike's disagreement <a href="/Articles/679963/">appears</a> to be a
desire to not allow processes to control resource management on his systems
at all.  As he put it: "<q>That's what happens when control freak meets
control freak, one of them ends up in pieces.  There can be only one, and
that one is me, the administrator.</q>"  That view clearly runs contrary
to what other users would like, though; there are constituencies out there
for process-level resource-management control.

<p>
That is where the conversation stands as of this writing, but it seems
certain that the discussion is not yet done.  There is a fundamental
disagreement here over how control groups should work, especially with
regard to how they interact with the CPU scheduler.  Tejun remains
confident, though, that his design meets the requirements of those who are
making real use of control groups now, and who need thread-level
scheduling.  Thus far, there have not been any well-developed alternatives
proposed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One part of the disagreement here is programs making use of control groups vs the administrator doing so.  Or in some cases the distribution's default behavior, which is influenced by the administrator.<br>
<p>
I have to say this is incredibly murky at hte moment, with the various patterns of use that have been in play since control groups were introduced.  Some systems may have an optional management interface, some systems may expect SystemD to be the point of control for control groups.  All of it is sort of half-documented.<br>
<p>
I work on a program that manages its own children, lots of them.  I'd like to use kernel features to limit the memory these children can use individually and collectively, if possible.  Control Groups can do this, but the path to a safe implementation that will work with the system as deployed and will not interfere with the administrator isn't clear at all.  One escape hatch I have, of course, is the ability to let the application administrator turn off all cgroup functionality within the program if he or she wants to control it via other means.  But I really need the software to do this by default as the vast majority of the people using the software aren't clever enough to know what a control group is.<br>

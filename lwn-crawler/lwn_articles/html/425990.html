<p>
Monitoring a system for "reliability, availability, and serviceability"
(RAS) is an important part of keeping that system, or a cluster of such
computers, up and running.  There is a
wide variety of things that could be monitored for RAS
purposes&mdash;memory errors, CPU 
temperature, RAID and filesystem health, and so on&mdash;but Borislav
Petkov's <a href="/Articles/424071/">RAS daemon</a> is just targeted at
gathering information on any machine check exceptions (MCEs) that occur.
The daemon uses trace events and the perf infrastructure, which
requires a fair amount of restructuring of that code to make it available
not only to the RAS daemon, but also for other kinds of tools.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to create persistent perf events, which are events that
are always enabled, and will have event buffers allocated, even if there is
no process currently looking at the data.  That allows the MCE trace event to be
enabled at boot time, 
before there is any task monitoring the perf buffer.  Once the boot has
completed, the RAS daemon (or some other program) can <tt>mmap()</tt> the
event buffers and start
monitoring the event.  This will allow the RAS daemon to pick up any MCE
events that happened during the boot process.
</p>

<p>
To do that, the <tt>struct&nbsp;perf_event_attr</tt> gets a new
<tt>persistent</tt> bitfield that is used to determine whether or not to
destroy the event buffers when they are unmapped.  In addition, persistent
events can be shared by multiple monitoring programs because they can be
mapped as shared and read-only. Once the persistent events are added, the
next patch then changes the MCE event
to become a 
persistent event.
</p>

<p>
With that stage set, Petkov then starts to rearrange the perf code so that the
RAS daemon and other tools can access some of the code that is currently
buried in the <tt>tools/perf</tt> directory.  That includes things like the
trace event utilities, which move from <tt>tools/perf/util</tt> to
<tt>tools/lib/trace</tt> and some helper functions for debugfs that move to
<tt>tools/lib/lk</tt>.  These were obviously things that were needed when
creating the RAS daemon, but not easily accessible. 
</p>

<p>
A similar patch moves the <tt>mmap()</tt> helper functions from the
<tt>tools/perf</tt> directory to another new library:
<tt>tools/lib/perf</tt>. These functions handle things like reading the
head of the event buffer queue, writing at the tail of the queue, and
reading and summing all of the per-cpu event counters for a given event.
</p>

<p> In <a href="/Articles/426027/">response</a> to the patch moving the
<tt>mmap()</tt> helpers, Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo pointed out that he had
already done some work to rework that code, and that it would reduce the
size of Petkov's patch set once it gets merged into the -tip tree.  He also
noted that he had created a set of Python bindings and a simple
perf-event-consuming 
<tt>twatch</tt> daemon using those bindings.  While Petkov had <a
href="/Articles/426030/">some reasons</a> for writing the RAS daemon in C
rather than Python, mostly so that it would work on systems without Python
or with outdated versions, he did seem impressed: "<q>twatch looks
almost like a child's play and even my grandma can profile her system now
:).</q>" </p>

<p>
But the Python bindings aren't necessarily meant for production code, as
Carvalho de Melo <a href="/Articles/426032/">describes</a>.  Because the
Python bindings are quite similar to their C counterparts, they can be used
to ensure that the kernel interfaces are right: 
<div class="BigQuote">
I.e. one can go on introducing the kernel interfaces and testing them
using python, where you can, for instance, from the python interpreter
command line, create counters, read its values, i.e. test the kernel
stuff quickly and easily.
<p>
Moving to a C version then becomes easy after the testing phase is over
and the kernel bits are set in stone.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are some additional patches that move things around within the
<tt>tools</tt> tree before the final patch actually adds the RAS daemon.
The daemon is fairly straightforward, with the bulk of it being
boilerplate daemon-izing code.  The rest parses the MCE event format (from
<tt>mce/mce_record/format</tt> file in debugfs), then opens
and maps the debugfs <tt>mce/mce_recordN</tt> files (where N is the CPU
number).  The main program sits in a loop checking for MCE events every
30 seconds, printing the CPU, MCE status, and address for any events that
have occurred to a log file.  Petkov mentions decoding of the MCE status as
something that he is currently working on.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the RAS daemon itself is not the end result Petkov is aiming
for.  Rather, it is just a proof-of-concept for persistent events and
demonstrates one way to rearrange the perf code so that other tools can use
it.  There may be disagreements about the way the libraries were arranged,
or the specific location of various helpers, but the overall goal seems
like a good one.  Whether tools like <tt>ras</tt> actually end up in the
kernel tree is, perhaps, questionable&mdash;the kernel hackers may not want to
maintain a bunch of tools of this kind&mdash;but by making the utility code
more accessible, it will make it much easier for others build these tools
on their own.

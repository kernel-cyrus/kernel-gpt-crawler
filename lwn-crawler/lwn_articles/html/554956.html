           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 19, 2013</br>
           </div>
Earlier this month, LWN <a href="/Articles/552885/">reported</a> on the
"line in the sand" drawn by Ingo Molnar with regard to power-aware
scheduling.  The fragmentation of CPU power management responsibilities
between the 
scheduler, CPU frequency governors, and CPUidle subsystem had to be
replaced, he said, by an integrated solution that put power management
decisions where the most information existed: in the scheduler itself.
An energetic conversation followed from that decree, and a possible way
forward is beginning to emerge.  But the problem remains difficult.
<p>
Putting the CPU scheduler in charge of CPU power management decisions has a
certain elegance; the scheduler is arguably in the best position to know
what the system's needs for processing power will be in the near future.
But this idea 
immediately runs afoul of another trend in the kernel: actual power
management decisions are moving away from the scheduler toward low-level
hardware driver code.  As Arjan van de Ven <a
href="https://plus.google.com/117091380454742934025/posts/2vEekAsG2QT">noted</a>
in a May Google+ discussion, power management policies for Intel CPUs are
being handled by CPU-specific code in recent kernels:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We also, and I realize this might be controversial, combine the
	control algorithm with the cpu driver in one. The reality is that
	such control algorithms are CPU specific, the notion of a generic
	"for all cpus" governors is just outright flawed; hardware behavior
	is key to the algorithm in the first place. 
</div>
<p>
Arjan suggests that any discussion that is based on control of CPU
frequencies and voltages misses an important point: current processors have
a more complex notion of power management, and they vary considerably from
one hardware generation to the next.  The scheduler is not the right place
for all that low-level information; instead, it belongs in low-level,
hardware-specific code.
<p>
There is, however, fairly widespread agreement that passing more
information between the scheduler and the low-level power management code
would be helpful.  In particular, there is a fair amount of interest in
better integration of the scheduler's load-balancing code (which decides
how to distribute processes across the available CPUs) and the power
management logic.  The load balancer knows what the current needs are and
can make some guesses about the near future; it makes sense that the same
code could take part in deciding which CPU resources should be available to
handle that load.
<p>
Based on these thoughts and more, Morten Rasmussen has posted <a
href="/Articles/554981/">a design proposal</a> for a reworked, power-aware
scheduler.  The current scheduler would be split into two separate modules:
<p>
<ol>
<li> The CPU scheduler, which is charged with making the best use of the 
     CPU resources that are currently available to it.
<p>
<li> The "power scheduler," which takes the responsibility of adjusting the
     currently available CPU resources to match the load seen by the CPU
     scheduler.
</ol>
<p>
The CPU scheduler will handle scheduling as it is done now.  The power
scheduler, instead, takes load information from the CPU scheduler and, if
necessary, makes changes to the system's power configuration to better suit
that load.  These changes can include moving CPUs from one power state to
another or idling (or waking) CPUs.  The power scheduler would
talk with the current frequency and idle drivers, but those drivers would
remain as separate, hardware-dependent code.  In this design, load
balancing would remain with the CPU scheduler; it would not move to the
power scheduler.
<p>
Of course, there are plenty of problems to be solved beyond the simple
implementation of the power scheduler and the definition of the interface
with the CPU scheduler.  The CPU scheduler still needs to
learn how to deal with processors with varying computing capacities; the
big.LITTLE architecture requires this, but more flexible power state
management does too.  Currently, processes are charged by the amount of
time they spend executing in a CPU; that is clearly unfair to processes
that are scheduled onto a slower processor.  So charging will eventually
have to change to a unit other than time; instructions executed, for
example.  The CPU scheduler will need to become more aware of the power
management policies in force.  Scheduling processes to enable the use of
"turbo boost" mode (where a single CPU can be overclocked if all other CPUs
are idle) remains an open problem.  Thermal limits will throw more
variables into the equation.  And so on.
<p>
It is also possible that the separation of CPU and power scheduling will
not work out; as Morten put it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'm aware that the scheduler and power scheduler decisions may be
	inextricably linked so we may decide to merge them. However, I think it
	is worth trying to keep the power scheduling decisions out of the
	scheduler until we have proven it infeasible.
</div>
<p>
Even with these uncertainties, the "power scheduler" approach should prove
to be a useful starting point; Morten and his colleagues plan to post a
preliminary power scheduler implementation in the near future.  At that
point we may hear how Ingo feels about this design relative to the
requirements he put forward; he (along with the other core scheduler
developers) has been notably absent from the recent discussion.
Regardless, it seems clear that the development community will be working
on power-aware scheduling for quite some time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
The problem with saying that the scheduler shouldn't care about this is that if it has no idea how fast a core is, or is going to be, how can it possibly attempt to put the right amount of load on it, or charge the process for the time it spent on that core?<br>
<p>
According to Arian, the only way to find out how fast a core is running is to measure it, and the speed that a core is running may vary by a factor of 2 without any notice to the OS.<br>
<p>
How can any system possibly make reasonable decisions if the hardware is so unpredictable?<br>

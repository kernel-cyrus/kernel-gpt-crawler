           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 5, 2014</br>
           </div>
System call design is never easy; there are often surprising edge cases
that developers fail to consider as they settle on an interface.  System
calls involving filesystems seem to be especially prone to this kind of
problem, since the complexity and variety of filesystem implementations means
that there may be any number of surprises waiting for a developer who wants
to create a new file-oriented operation.  Some of these surprises can be
seen in the discussion of a proposed addition to the <tt>fallocate()</tt>
system call.
<p>
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html"><tt>fallocate()</tt></a>
is concerned with the allocation of space within a file; its initial
purpose was to allow an application to allocate blocks to a file prior to
writing them.  This type of preallocation ensures that the needed space is
available before trying to write the data that goes there; it can also help
filesystem implementations lay out the allocated space more efficiently on
disk.  Later on, the 
<tt>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE</tt> operation was added to deallocate blocks
within a file, leaving a hole in the file.
<p>
In February, Namjae Jeon proposed <a href="/Articles/589262/">a new
<tt>fallocate()</tt> operation</a> called
<tt>FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE</tt>; this proposal included implementations
for the ext4 and xfs filesystems.  Like the hole-punching operation, it
removes data from a file, but there is a difference: rather than leaving a
hole in the file, this operation moves all data beyond the affected range
to the beginning of that range, shortening the file as a whole.  The
immediate user for this
operation would appear to be video editing applications, which could use it
to quickly and efficiently remove a segment of a video file.  If the
removed range is block-aligned (which would be a requirement, at least for
some filesystems), the removal could be effected by changing the file's
extent maps, with no actual copying of data required.  Given that files
containing video data can be large, it is not hard to understand why an
efficient "cut" operation would be attractive.
<p>
So what kinds of questions arise with an operation like this?  One could
start with the interaction with the <tt>mmap()</tt> system call, which
maps a file into a process's address space.  The proposed implementation
works by removing all pages from the affected range to the end of the file
from the page cache; dirty pages are written back to disk first.  That will
prevent the 
immediate loss of data that may have been written via a mapping, and will
get rid of any memory pages that will be after the end of the file once the
operation is complete.  But it could be a surprise for a process that does
not expect the contents of a file to shift around underneath its mapping.
That is not expected to be a huge problem; as Dave Chinner <a
href="/Articles/589267/">pointed out</a>, the types of applications that
would use the collapse operation do not generally access their files via
<tt>mmap()</tt>.  Beyond that, applications that are surprised by a
collapsed file may well be unable to deal with other modifications even in
the absence of a collapse operation.
<p>
But, as Hugh Dickins <a href="/Articles/589268/">noted</a>, there is a
related problem: in the tmpfs filesystem, all files live in the page cache
and look a lot like a memory mapping.  Since the page cache <i>is</i> the backing
store, removing file pages from the page cache is unlikely to lead to a
happy ending.  So, before tmpfs could support the collapse
operation, a lot more effort 
would have to go into making things play well with the page cache.  Hugh
was not sure that there would ever be a need for this operation in tmpfs,
but, he said, solving the page cache issues for tmpfs would likely lead to
a more robust implementation for other filesystems as well.
<p>
Hugh also wondered whether the uni-directional collapse operation should,
instead, be designed to work in both directions:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 I'm a little sad at the name COLLAPSE, but probably seven months
	 too late to object.  It surprises me that you're doing all this
	 work to deflate a part of the file, without the obvious
	 complementary work to inflate it - presumably all those
	 advertisers whose ads you're cutting out, will come back to us
	 soon to ask for inflation, so that they have somewhere to reinsert
	 them.
</div>
<p>
Andrew Morton went a little further, <a
href="/Articles/589303/">suggesting</a> that a simple "<q>move these
blocks from here to there</q>" system call might be the best idea.  But
Dave <a href="/Articles/589304/">took a dim view</a> of that suggestion,
worrying that it would introduce a great deal of complexity and difficult
corner cases:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	IOWs, collapse range is a simple operation, "move arbitrary blocks
	from here to there" is a nightmare both from the specification and
	the implementation points of view.
</div>
<p>
Andrew <a href="/Articles/589503/">disagreed</a>, claiming that a more
general interface was preferable and 
that the problems could be overcome, but nobody else supported him on this
point.  So, chances are, the operation will remain confined to collapsing
chunks out of files; a separate "insert" operation may be added in the
future, should an interesting use case for it be found.
<p>
Meanwhile, there is one other behavioral question to answer; what happens
if the region to be removed from the file reaches to the end of the file?
The current patch set returns <tt>EINVAL</tt> in that situation, with the
idea that a call to <tt>truncate()</tt> should be used instead.  Ted Ts'o
<a href="/Articles/589308/">asked</a> whether such operations should just
be turned directly into <tt>truncate()</tt> calls, but Dave is <a
href="/Articles/589309/">set against</a> that idea.  A collapse operation
that includes the end of the file, he said, is almost certainly buggy; it
is better to return an error in that case.
<p>
There are also, evidently, some interesting security issues that could come
up if a collapse operation were allowed to include the end of the file.
Filesystems can allocate blocks beyond the end of the file; indeed,
<tt>fallocate()</tt> can be used to explicitly request that behavior.  Those blocks
are typically not zeroed out by the filesystem; instead, they are kept
inaccessible so that whatever stale data is contained there cannot be
read.  Without a great deal of care, a collapse implementation that allowed
the range to go beyond the end of the file could end up exposing that data,
especially if the operation were to be interrupted (by a system crash,
perhaps) in the middle.  Rather than set that sort of trap for filesystem
developers, Dave would prefer to disallow the risky operations from the
beginning, especially since there does not appear to be any real need to
support them.
<p>
So the end result of all this discussion is that the
<tt>FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE</tt> operation is likely to go into the kernel
essentially unchanged.  It will not have all the capabilities that some
developers would have liked to see, but it will support one useful feature
that should help to accelerate a useful class of applications.  Whether
this will be enough for the long term remains to be seen; system call API
design is hard.  But, should additional features be needed in the future,
new <tt>FALLOC_FL</tt> commands can be created to make them available in a
compatible way.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm a bit confused by the use case - which video file formats have frames aligned on 4K boundaries and so could make use of this?<br>
<p>
Surely a video editor maintains a separate file with references into various source materials, and then renders the whole when done.... but maybe I have an overly simplistic understanding of video editing.<br>

In my view, this is a general problem - programs want to be able to insert, delete and move data around anywhere inside a file.  This is a standard mode of operation for any editor - video, audio, text, graphics, metadata, binary data, database, etc.  And not just 4k blocks, or sector blocks - arbitrary quantities.<br>
<p>
It's just that operating systems traditionally have not supported this, because it's easier to take the problem of mapping data in the file to data on the disk and pass it straight on to the user-space program - especially when you're trying to write an operating system to fit in the kinds of memory spaces we had thirty years ago.<br>
<p>
So every program tries to implement this differently, based on its own different requirements.  And each one makes compromises, and reinvents the wheel, and makes the same mistakes, and doesn't try to solve the whole problem.<br>
<p>
Now, to support arbitrary chunk sizes requires considerable work anywhere you implement it.  Maybe it requires significant rethinking of the file system itself.  Maybe this won't even be available in older filesystems.  It doesn't mean that it isn't a useful thing to do.<br>
<p>
Maybe a good way to start is to write a new library that provides these functions, as well as the traditional operations, as a file handle.  If it's running on a traditional file system without support for arbitrary range operations, then it implements its own using internal metadata.  The file on disk won't be exactly the same as the raw data, but at this stage it's really more for internal operations - in the same way as Audacity's internal save format is not really useable as a playback format in other programs.<br>
<p>
Hmmmmmm - libnewfile - another project for me to try... :-)<br>
<p>
Then the library would recognise the features of the file system it was writing to and use these for greater efficiency.  And in the rainbow unicorn chocolate pony future, when the file system supported these operations natively, the implementation in libnewfile would simply pass them straight through to the file system.<br>
<p>
But IMO saying "we can't implement this - we've been doing it this way for the last thirty years" is never a convincing argument.<br>
<p>
Have fun,<br>
<p>

Maybe it will be done as soon as the hard disk and its DMA subsystem support arbitrary chunk sizes? Some video format are in blocks of 188 bytes.<br>
I am not saying that ultimately the page cache shall not support reasonable multiple power-of-two block sizes.<br>

I actually wrote something like that a few years ago, when I was a little kid. I called it offset_fs, instead of libnewfile. If a filename ended in -desc, it would be interpreted as<br>
   #comments<br>
   /path/to/file1: offset,length<br>
   /path/to/file2: offset,length<br>
   #etc<br>
and the concatentation of the specified file slices would be obtained upon reading it back.<br>
<p>
It's been useful occassionally. <br>

However, it's been so long, I forgot how to compile it. -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 and -lpthread and maybe one or two other options. Sorry.<br>

Most video formats have framing and I imagine they have some kind of comment frame. So you could use fallocate() to get rid of any 4k aligned blocks you want to get of, and write in a comment frame for the remaining bytes.<br>

I've got the sneaking suspicion that btrfs may already be able to do everything that's required, since it has an ioctl for cloning a range of data in a file, that can work on the same file.<br>
<p>
I don't know if it'll handle moving nicely, but even if it doesn't, you can create a new copy of the file without the required range, by just cloning the data before and after into it, then replace your old file with the new one.<br>

I would think Andrew's proposal is doable...<br>
<p>
Insert range:<br>
- add sufficient data to end of file using fallocate()<br>
- move range into position<br>
<p>
Remove range:<br>
- move range to end of file<br>
- truncate()<br>
<p>
With regards to mmap(), tmpfs, etc. you don't need to care about writeback of dirty data, mmap resize, etc. You just swap the mapping of pages around and have truncate() and fallocate() do the hard stuff.<br>
<p>
But then again, I'm not hindered by any knowledge on the subject...<br>

I seems that the basic code is already there. Why not just add a syscall to shuffle blocks around?<br>

      <p>I very much like Andrews approach:<ul>
<li>The mmap() interpretation becomes very trivial since the blocks now appear in the new location as if by magic, while the former blocks are still available until you do the truncate().</li>
<li>There is no issue with allocated but unused blocks at the end of the file since you haven't changed the file size and the truncate() is already handling the issue</li>
<li>You have no issue with collapse extending to the end of the file since trucate() handles this issue.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>With so many issues with the interface as proposed, and a very simple alternative, it's not clear to me why you'd do anything else.</p>

This functionality DEFINITELY needs to be generalized to move data between two arbitrary files and ranges (of course it can fail if there specific arrangement is not supported).<br>
<p>
It's absurd to just have an ad-hoc "insert hole".<br>

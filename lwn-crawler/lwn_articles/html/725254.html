Network acceleration has always been a subject that naturally attracts the
interest of network device vendors and developers.  Kernel network
acceleration techniques that require, for example, the caching of kernel
networking data structures inside the network driver (or maintaining a
private modified kernel for a specific device) are naturally frowned upon
and bound to be rejected by the kernel networking community. There are
also user-space kernel-bypass solutions, including the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/">Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)</a>.

<p>
Among the most popular open-source projects providing user-space network
acceleration are  
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/713918/">Snabb</a>,
<a href="http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/">netmap</a>,
and DPDK.  With the recent 
<a
href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/announcements/networking-industry-leaders-join-forces-to-expand-new-open-source-community-to-drive">announcement</a>
by Jim Zemlin this April that DPDK project has moved to the Linux Foundation, 
it seems that this is a good time to get an overview of the current status
of this project and its roadmap. 

<p>
<h4>The DPDK project</h4>
<p>
DPDK was created by Intel in 2010 as a suite of tools that enable the
efficient transfer of packets through a server. In 2013, the project
web site, www.dpdk.org, was created by 6Wind and, recently, it moved to the
Linux Foundation. DPDK is a set of
libraries and drivers written in C providing I/O 
acceleration for network and cryptographic devices. It is a fully open-source
(BSD-licensed) project, and it runs on Linux and FreeBSD.  The project
maintainer is Thomas Monjalon.
<p>
DPDK is used by more than 20 open-source projects, including
<a href="https://www.opnfv.org/">OPNFV</a>,
<a
href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/open-vswitch-with-dpdk-overview">OvS-DPDK</a>,
the Fast Data project (<a href="https://fd.io/">FD.io</a>),
<a href="https://github.com/rumpkernel/drv-netif-dpdk">Rump</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ansyun/dpdk-nginx">dpdk-nginx</a>,
<a href="https://www.opendaylight.org/">OpenDaylight</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-vrouter">Contrail Virtual Router</a>,
and more. It supports a wide variety of platforms and 
<a href="http://dpdk.org/doc/nics">over 20 types of interface cards</a>; it runs
on a variety of CPU architectures.

It includes
contributions from over 400 individuals from 70
different organizations. Starting April 2016, it adopted the Ubuntu
numbering scheme, where each release is tagged as YY.MM; so the last DPDK
release is DPDK 17.05, from May 2017, and the next release will be DPDK
17.08, which will be released in August 2017, reflecting the project's
quarterly release cadence.

<p>

Among
the interesting new features added in DPDK 17.05 is
the new event-driven programming model library
(<tt>rte_eventdev</tt>). In this model, as opposed to the polling model,
the cores 
call the DPDK scheduler, which selects packets for them.  This model adds
support 
for dynamic load balancing, automatic multi-core scaling, and more. 
Until 17.05, the DPDK cryptodev API 
had supported only Intel hardware accelerators; a new poll
mode driver was added by NXP for its <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/nics/dpaa2.html">Data Path Acceleration 
Architecture Gen2</a> cryptographic accelerators.

<p>
One of the more interesting features introduced in the previous release,
DPDK 17.02, is the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/prog_guide/rte_flow.html">generic flow API
(rte_flow)</a>, which provides a generic 
means to configure hardware to match specific ingress or egress traffic. In
<a href="http://dpdk.org/dev/roadmap">the upcoming 17.08 release</a>, one
can 
expect to see features like support for a generic quality-of-service API,
<a href="/Articles/358910/">generic receive offload</a> support, and more.



<p>
<h4>A simple DPDK application</h4>
<p>

Before delving into the details, let's
take a look at a simple <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer">layer&nbsp;2 (L2)</a>
forwarding DPDK application; becoming familiar
with it will help to understand and develop more advanced DPDK
applications.  With this program, packets arriving at one port will be
forwarded back via a second port after switching the source and destination
MAC addresses.
<p>
After initializations of ports, queues, and other settings via generic calls
like <tt><a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/api/rte__ethdev_8h.html#ac30d075b4b206c7122e200164ce69893">rte_eth_dev_configure()</a></tt>,
the program enters the following loop:
<p>
<pre>
    struct rte_mbuf *m;
    /* ... */
    while (!force_quit) {
	/* ... */
	nb_rx = rte_eth_rx_burst((uint8_t) portid, 0, pkts_burst, MAX_PKT_BURST);
	port_statistics[portid].rx += nb_rx;
	for (j = 0; j &lt; nb_rx; j++) {
  	    m = pkts_burst[j];
	    /* ... */
	    l2fwd_simple_forward(m, portid);
	}
</pre>
<p>

In this loop, we read received packets (represented by the
<tt>rte_mbuf</tt> structure) from
the incoming port in a burst of size <tt>MAX_PKT_BURST</tt>, update the
stats, and 
then each packet is processed by 
<tt>l2fwd_simple_forward()</tt>, which switches the source and the
destination MAC addresses of this packet and transmits it via the outgoing
port by invoking <tt><a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/api/rte__ethdev_8h.html#a1b95c114276a21717b20be4cbf112223">rte_eth_tx_buffer()</a></tt>.
<p>

This example, (like other DPDK applications) uses a high-level DPDK API,
which does not depend on 
the implementation details of any specific DPDK network driver.
Those who want to delve into the full source code  for this example can find it
<a href="http://dpdk.org/browse/dpdk/tree/examples/l2fwd/main.c">here</a>. 
More information can also be found in the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/sample_app_ug/">Sample Applications User
Guides</a>. 
<p>

<h4>DPDK components</h4>
<p>

Those who want to start learning and exploring DPDK could
start with the many sample applications on the
<a href="http://dpdk.org/browse/dpdk/tree/examples/">examples page</a>.
There are over 40 of them, starting from a simple 
"hello world" and proceeding to more complex applications like IP
pipelining and an IPSec gateway. 
All these examples are well documented.  It
is also recommended learning to use the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/testpmd_app_ug/index.html"><tt>testpmd</tt></a>
tool, which enables you to start and stop packet forwarding,
display statistics, configure various settings, and more.
<p>

For those who want to become familiar with the DPDK API, it is recommended
to explore the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/prog_guide">Programmer's Guide</a> 
and the fundamental data structures.  Those structures include
the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/api/structrte__mbuf.html"><tt>rte_mbuf</tt>
structure</a> (representing a packet) and the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/api/rte__ethdev_8h.html#details"><tt>rte_ethdev</tt>  
structure</a> (representing a network device).  One should also learn the <a href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/prog_guide/env_abstraction_layer.html">Environment
Abstraction Layer</a> API.
<p>
For more advanced DPDK knowledge,
it is worth learning the memory pools implementation (the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/api/structrte__mempool.html"><tt>rte_mempool</tt></a> 
object and the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/prog_guide/mempool_lib.html"><tt>librte_mempool</tt>
library</a>). Those who are seeking 
familiarity with the cryptographic layer can explore the
<a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/api/structrte__cryptodev.html"><tt>rte_cryptodev</tt></a>
structure, representing a cryptographic device.
See also the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides-16.04/prog_guide/cryptodev_lib.html">cryptodev
API</a>,
which provides cryptographic poll-mode drivers as well as
a standard API that supports all these drivers and can be used to perform
cipher, authentication, and symmetric cryptographic operations.
The library also enables migration
between hardware and software cryptographic accelerators.  One should
become familiar with the <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/tools/devbind.html"><tt>dpdk-devbind</tt>
script</a> in order to 
bind and unbind devices and in order to view the status of the NICs.
<p>

The DPDK web site contains a set of open-source tools such as
the <a href="http://dpdk.org/browse/tools/dpdk-ci/">dpdk-ci</a>
continuous-integration suite
and the <a href="http://dpdk.org/doc/dts/gsg/">DPDK test suite (DTS)</a>,
which is a Python-based testing framework.  DTS works with software
traffic generators like <a
href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">Scapy</a> and
<a href="http://dpdk.org/browse/apps/pktgen-dpdk/">pktgen-dpdk</a>;
it can also be used with the IXIA hardware traffic generator.

DTS is easy to set up and run; it contains over 90 test modules for
various networking scenarios.  Here, again, one can start with a simple "hello
world" test, and end up with complex tests including <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization">SR-IOV</a>
and live
migration. Currently DTS supports Intel and Mellanox NICs, and patches for
Cavium Networks NICs are circulating on the DTS mailing list. DTS provides both
functional tests as well as benchmarking tests.
<p>
The DPDK site also hosts
pktgen-dpdk, which is a DPDK-based traffic generator.
There are more DPDK-based, open-source traffic generators, including
<a href="https://wiki.fd.io/view/TRex">TRex</a>,
which has both a stateful mode (which
can be helpful when testing load balancers and NATs for example) and a
stateless mode, and the LuaJIT-based <a
href="https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen">MoonGen project</a>. 
<p>

Work has been done to add DPDK plugins to <a
href="https://collectd.org/">collectd</a>, which is 
a popular system statistics collection daemon.  Two DPDK plugins have been
merged into collectd: <a
href="https://github.com/collectd/collectd/blob/master/src/dpdkevents.c">dpdkevents</a> 
and
<a
href="https://github.com/collectd/collectd/blob/master/src/dpdkstat.c">dpdkstat</a>.
The
dpdkevents plugin retrieves the DPDK link status and the DPDK forwarding core's
status.  The dpdkstat plugin polls statistics from DPDK drivers.
<p>

<h4>DPDK at higher layers</h4>
<p>

While DPDK applications are focused mostly on layer 2, there are several
interesting  
projects under FD.io that use DPDK as their primary I/O layer, including 
<a href="https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP">VPP</a>.
Also worth a mention is the <a
href="https://wiki.fd.io/view/TLDK">Transport Layer Development Kit 
(TLDK)</a> project, implementing a set of libraries for Layer-4 protocol
processing.  
For those who are interested to learn
more about TLDK, we suggest watching Ray Kinsella's talk at FOSDEM 2017: 
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/tldk/">Accelerating TCP
with TLDK</a>.
<p>

<h4>DPDK and the community</h4>
<p>

All DPDK development is done over the public <a
href="http://dpdk.org/ml/archives/dev/">dev@dpdk.org</a> mailing
list. 
The guidelines for contributing code to DPDK are described <a
href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/contributing/patches.html">here</a>.
Long-term
support releases are available, with support for two years. Governance
for DPDK is provided by <a href="http://dpdk.org/about/charter">two
boards</a>: a Governing Board (budget, marketing,
etc.) and a Technical Board (technical issues including approval of new
sub-projects, deprecating old sub-projects, etc).
<p>
The DPDK project is a community-driven project and, as such, there are
several DPDK events across the globe.  The last DPDK Summits
were held in Bangalore in April 2017 (the
first DPDK Summit to be held in India) and
<a href="https://dpdksummit.com/">the Shanghai summit</a>, which ws
held in June.  
Many <a href="https://dpdksummit.com/us/en/past-events">videos from past
events are available</a>; 
there is also more information in the <a
href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/networking/dpdk">Intel Developer
Zone</a> and in the <a
href="https://builders.intel.com/university/networkbuilders">Intel Network
Builders University Program</a>.
 
<p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>

The DPDK project has become a popular open-source, user-space network and
cryptographic acceleration solution based on bypassing the kernel.  This
project is gaining momentum, especially with the recent move to the Linux
Foundation; it is worth following, experimenting with, and contributing to.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

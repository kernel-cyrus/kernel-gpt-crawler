           </div>
<p>
One of the requests in the recently posted "<a
href="/Articles/462076/">Plumber's Wish List</a>" was for a way for a
process to reliably detect that it isn't in the root PID namespace (i.e. is
in a "container", at least by some definition).  That wish sparked an
interesting discussion on linux-kernel about the nature of containers and
what people might use them for.  Some would like to be able to run standard
Linux distributions inside a container, but others are not so sure that is
a useful goal.  
</p>

<p>
A container is a way to isolate a group of processes from the rest of a
running Linux system.  By using namespaces, that group can have its own
private view of the OS&mdash;though, crucially, sharing the same kernel
with whatever else is running&mdash;with its own PID space, filesystems,
networking devices, and so on.  Containers are, in some ways, conceptually
similar to virtualization, with the separate vs. shared kernel being the
obvious user-visible difference between the two.  But there are
straightforward ways to detect that you are running under virtualization
and that is not true for containers/namespaces.
</p>

<p>
Lennart Poettering&mdash;one of the wishing plumbers&mdash;<a
href="/Articles/462725/">outlined</a> the need for detecting whether a
process is running in a child PID namespace:
<div class="BigQuote">
To make a standard distribution run nicely in a Linux container you
usually have to make quite a number of modifications to it and disable
certain things from the boot process. Ideally however, one could simply
boot the same image on a real machine and in a container and would just
do the right thing, fully stateless. And for that you need to be able to
detect containers, and currently you can't.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He goes on to list a number of different things that are not "virtualized"
by namespaces, including sysfs, <tt>/proc/sys</tt>, SELinux, udev, and
more.  Standard Linux distributions currently assume that they have full
control of the system and the init process will do a wide variety of
unpleasant things when it runs inside a container.  
Distributions could
make use of a reliable way of detecting containerization to avoid (or
change) actions with effects outside the container.
  Poettering went on to point out that
"<q>having a way to detect execution in a container is 
a minimum requirement to get general purpose distribution makers to
officially support and care for execution in container environments</q>".
</p>

<p>
Eric W. Biederman, who is one of the namespace developers, <a
href="/Articles/462741/">agreed</a> with the idea: "<q>I agree getting to the point where we can run a standard distribution
unmodified in a container sounds like a reasonable goal.</q>" He
suggested two possible solutions for a straightforward detection scheme
(either putting a file into the container's root directory or modifying the
output of <tt>uname</tt>), but also started looking at all of the different
areas that will need to be addressed to make it possible to run
distributions inside containers.  Much of that depends on finishing up the
work on <a href="/Articles/420624/">user (i.e. UID) namespaces</a>.
</p>

<p>
But Ted Ts'o is a bit <a href="/Articles/462743/">skeptical</a> of the need
to run full distributions inside a container.  The advantage that
containers have over virtual machines (VMs) is that they are lighter weight, he
said, and adding multiple copies of system services (he mentions udev and
D-Bus) starts to remove that advantage.  He wonders if it makes more sense
to just use a VM:
<div class="BigQuote">
If you end up [with] so much overhead to provide the desired security and/or
performance isolation, then it becomes fair to ask the question
whether you might as well pay a tad bit more and get even better
security and isolation by using a VM solution....
</div>
</p>

<p>
In a <a href="/Articles/462756/">second message</a>, Ts'o expands on his
thinking, particularly regarding security.  He is not optimistic about
using containers that way: "<q>given that kernel is shared, trying to use
containers to provide better security isolation between mutually
suspicious users is hopeless</q>". The likelihood that an "isolated"
user can find a local privilege escalation is just too high, and that will
allow the user to escape the container and compromise the system as a whole. He is concerned that adding in more kernel complexity to allow
distributions to run unchanged in containers may be wasted effort:
<div class="BigQuote">
So if you want that kind of security isolation, you shouldn't be using
containers in the first place.  You should be using KVM or Xen, and
then only after spending a huge amount of effort fuzz testing the
KVM/Xen paravirtualization interfaces.  So at least in my mind, adding
vast amounts of complexities to try to provide security isolation via
containers is really not worth it. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
Biederman, though, <a href="/Articles/462775/">thinks</a> that there are
situations where it would be convenient to be able to run distribution
images "<q>just
like I find it [convenient] to loopback mount an iso image to see
what is on a disk image</q>". But, firing up KVM to run the distribution
may be just as easy, and works today, as Ts'o <a href="/Articles/462788/">pointed out</a>.
There are more platforms out there than just those that KVM supports, however,
so Biederman <a href="/Articles/462789/">believes</a> there is a place for
supporting containerized distributions:
<div class="BigQuote">
You can test a lot more logical machines interacting
with containers than you can with vms.  And you can test on all the
[architectures] and platforms linux supports not just the handful that are
well supported by hardware virtualization.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In the end, Biederman is not convinced that there is a "<q>good reason to have a design that doesn't allow you to run a full
userspace</q>". He also notes that with the current implementation of
containers (i.e. without UID namespaces), all users in the container are
the same as their counterparts outside the container, and that includes the
root user.  Adding UID namespaces would allow a container to partition its
users from those of the "external" system, so that root inside the
container can't make changes that affect the entire system:
<div class="BigQuote">
With user namespaces what we get is that the global root user is not the
container root user and we have been working our way through the
permission checks in the kernel to ensure we get them right in the
context of the user namespace.  This trivially means that the things
that we allow the global root user to do in /proc/ and /sysfs and
the like simply won't be allowed as a container root user.  Which
makes doing something stupid and affecting other people much more
difficult.
</div>
</p>

<p>
UID namespaces are still a ways out, Biederman said, so problems with
global sysctl settings from within containers can still cause weirdness,
but "<q>once the
user namespaces are in place accessing a truly global sysctl will
result in EPERM when you are in a container and everyone will be
happy. ;)</q>". There are some interesting implications of UID
namespaces that may 
eventually need to be addressed, he said, including persistent UIDs in
filesystems:
<div class="BigQuote">
So
once we have all of the permission checks in the kernel tweaked to care
about user namespaces we next look at the filesystems.   The easy
initial implementation is going to be just associating a user namespace
with a super block.  But farther out being able to store uids from
different user namespaces on the same filesystem becomes an interesting
problem.
<p>
We already have things like user mapping in 9p and nfsv4 so it isn't
wholly uncharted territory.  But it could get interesting. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
Interesting indeed.  One might wonder whether there will be some pushback
from other kernel hackers about adding mapping layers to filesystems
(presumably in the VFS code so that it works for all of them).  Since
virtualization can solve many of the problems that are still being worked
on in containers (at least for some hardware platforms), there may be
questions about adding further kernel complexity to support full-scale
containerization as envisioned by Biederman (and others).  That is
essentially the 
argument that Ts'o is making, and one might guess that others have
similar feelings.
</p>

<p>
In any case, no patches have yet appeared for detecting that a process is
running in a container, but it may not require any changes to the kernel.
Poettering <a 
href="/Articles/462800/">mentioned</a> that LXC containers set an
environment variable that processes can use for that purpose, and Biederman
seemed to think that might be a reasonable solution (and wouldn't require
kernel changes as it is just a user-space convention). Making a new UTS
namespace (and changing the output of <tt>uname</tt>) as Biederman
suggested would be another way to handle the problem from user space.  That
part seems like it will get solved in short order, but the more general
questions of containers and security isolation are likely to be with us for
some time to come.

The short version. 99% of the code has been written and merged already.<br>
<p>
The reason the question of running a distribution in a container even comes up is that people are already doing that today.<br>
<p>
At the level of a distribution there are still a few rough patches in the coverage so it was worth having the discussion.  The big piece left in my opinion is finishing the user namespace and that work at this point is a few small patches and review review review.  It is the permission checks we are touching and it is important to look very carefully so you don't fat finger something.<br>

A few years ago we wrote this design for a method to load a SELinux policy through a simple translation layer to have it protect a chroot container as if it were an independent system.  It basically attaches a per-container namespace to SELinux context names, fs labels, perhaps a fuse-like per-container /selinux translation layer, and relies upon the host kernel to enforce in the way it usually does.  The benefit to this approach is you can use almost unmodified SELinux policies.  SELinux is of course only part of the container isolation requirements.
<P />
I'm surprised this article didn't mention VServer or OpenVZ.  Don't those container methods have some kind of virtualized /sys and /proc?  I might be wrong.

Me too (hi Warren), and I find it amusing to tweak init not to do bad things to the poor system instead of tweaking the system to thwart bad things that init, and some less well-bred processes, might inflict on it -- incidentally or not.  OpenVZ does pretty decent job at being actually useful (I run it on every server I'm responsible for, and I've worked with LXC as well).<br>

OTOH upon reading the CPU modaliases snippet I've been jumpin' and crying "yes, yes, this one" :)<br>

Is the idea to actually run a full, unmodified distribution in a container, or to have an unmodified distribution know that it is running in a container and run only those services that are not provided from outside? It seems like people are arguing against the former, but the wishlist item wouldn't even make sense for that goal: a distro running everything wouldn't need to know it was in a container.<br>
<p>
I think it would actually be quite neat to do something like run Oracle on RHEL in a container on Debian, where Oracle doesn't notice that RHEL isn't actually doing a bunch of things it normally does, because the RHEL libraries and executables are in the usual places, things are installed from RPMs with an accurate database of packages installed that might be dependencies, init scripts appropriate to the runlevel get run, /dev contains the expected devices, and so forth. Meanwhile, the user whose workstation this is runs programs packaged in debs and doesn't have to be in a RHEL environment aside from for messing with the database installation.<br>

what you describe (running Oracle on RHEL inside a container on Debian) is already possible, and pretty easy today.<br>
<p>
the 'problem' is that to start it up you don't run init and have it walk through all the /etc/rc2.d/* scripts, instead you have some other script (probably outside the container) that does the work of mounting whatever you need inside the container (including with bind mounts as appropriate) and then starts up the needed things in /etc/init.d/ via chroot commands.<br>
<p>
It works well, and has worked well for many years with just chroot. 'container' features add additional isolation to this, but this isolation also needs to be setup outside of the container itself (as this isolation piece needs to know about the global system, that will also need to be done outside of the container)<br>

Same here: When I've migrated some old live systems to a new distro or distro version (especially if it's a big leap), I've sometimes kept the old distro running as a chroot inside the new one, so that services can be migrated one by one afterwards, and they have access to the same unix and inet sockets, and the same filesystems with "local" filesystem semantics, and the system's overall memory usage stays much the same.<br>
<p>
(Unfortunately network filesystems aren't drop-in equivalent to local ones, the iptables needed isn't always trivial when the new and old need to share the same IP to avoid disruptive elsewhere, and sometimes you get hardware that doesn't support hardware virtualisation anyway (ironically one of those was running in a VM itself), so KVM hasn't always been a good choice.)<br>
<p>
It works pretty well, but the script outside that you have to cobble together to replace whatever /etc/rc.* and/or /etc/init*/* does is always a pain, very distro and installation specific, and needs manually updating after changes to the inner distro.  Just being able to run init would be really handy.<br>

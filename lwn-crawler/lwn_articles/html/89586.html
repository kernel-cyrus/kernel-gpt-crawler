<h1>A nasty FPU bug</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted June 15, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The problem was initially <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15905">reported as a gcc
bug</a>.  If you execute this code:
<p>
<pre>
    static void Handler(int ignore)
    {
	char fpubuf[108];
	__asm__ __volatile__ ("fsave %0\n" : : "m"(fpubuf));
	__asm__ __volatile__ ("frstor %0\n" : : "m"(fpubuf));
    }
</pre>
<p>
in a signal handler, the system (or, at least, the CPU that was running the
code) will freeze up hard.  Ways of locking up the system from an
unprivileged user-space program are generally considered to be bad news;
they also, in general, are not seen as compiler bugs.  A bit of digging
turned up the real problem, and the latest kernel denial of service
vulnerability was found.
<p>

In theory, the <tt>fsave</tt> instruction above saves the floating-point unit
(FPU) status into the <tt>fpubuf</tt> array; the subsequent <tt>frstor</tt>
should simply restore the same state back into the FPU.  Unfortunately, the
above code is incorrect; the assembly instructions should read
<tt>"m"(*fpubuf)</tt> to actually store the state into the <tt>fpubuf</tt>
array.  The code, as written, restores from the wrong address, corrupting
the state of the FPU and, in particular, setting some exception flags.
<p>
FPU exceptions do not result in immediate kernel traps; instead, the trap
happens when the next floating-point command is executed.  As it happens,
the kernel checks when a signal handler returns and, if that handler has
used any floating-point instructions, the kernel performs an <tt>fwait</tt>
instruction to ensure that the last operation is complete.  That <tt>fwait</tt>
causes the floating point exception caused by the corrupt restore to be
delivered as a kernel trap.
<p>
The kernel has a way of dealing with floating point traps; it saves the FPU
state and queues up a floating point exception signal for the current
process.  It also sets the TS ("task switched") processor flag to indicate
that the FPU state may be other than expected.  At that point, it returns
to the place where the exception occurred.
<p>
Normally, as part of returning from the trap, the kernel would simply
deliver the floating-point exception signal to user space and get on with life.  But, in
this case, the kernel is returning back to kernel space, and back to the
same <tt>fwait</tt> instruction that caused the problem in the first
place.  That instruction sees the TS flag and generates another trap.  The
handler for this trap knows just what to do in response to a TS flag; it
restores the saved FPU state and returns.  The saved FPU state is, however,
the corrupted state which was in effect before the first attempt to execute
<tt>fwait</tt>.  So, at this point, the loop is closed and a new
floating-point trap will be generated.  This will go on for a while.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/89595/">fix</a> is relatively straightforward, once
the problem is understood.  The kernel simply clears any pending exceptions
before executing <tt>fwait</tt>, and the problem goes away.  All that is
left is the updating and rebooting of large numbers of vulnerable systems.

      /THAT'S/ what all the hubbub has been about.  I read the reference to the <br>bug on the Gentoo-devel list, but the devels (rightly, IMO) didn't react <br>as I guess the poster expected, and pretty much said &quot;it'll be handled <br>upstream much more efficiently than we can handle it here&quot;, and left  it <br>at that.  Later, I saw mention on Gentoo-user, and think I saw fleeting <br>mention of it here on LWN as well.  However, I didn't know what it was all <br>about. <br> <br>That said, I wasn't incredibly anxious about it either, because I've been <br>an LWN subscriber and reader for long enough I knew it'd probably all be <br>explained here, in the weekly edition, clear as crystal, and so it was! <br> <br>Thanks! <br> <br>Very literally, the weekly kernel sections are the reason I subscribe to <br>LWN.  The various Linux new items I could get elsewhere, and there are <br>plenty of places to get opinion pieces on Linux.  However, I've yet to <br>find anything that CLOSE to matches LWN's weekly kernel columns for <br>clarity and efficiency.  (Reading LKML would often eventually be as clear, <br>and certainly at times entertaining, but unfortunately, I haven't yet <br>found the time, so it would lack in efficiency.)  The other content may be <br>replacable tho at some loss of focus and efficiency within the community.  <br>There IS no replacement for LWN's weekly kernel section. <br> <br>Duncan, continuing proud LWN subscriber! <br>

      I'm just wondering what the fwait should do after the fnclex. The  <br>instruction fnclex clears all exceptions including the ES flag, so the <br>following fwait will not generate traps anymore. <br>  <br>So the patch could simply exchange fwait with fnclex.  <br>  <br>

      The whole explanation turns on the involvement of the TS flag.  What's a TS flag?

      From the article: "<i>It also sets the TS ("task switched") processor flag to indicate that the FPU state may be other than expected.</i>"
<p>
That's really what the flag means: a task switch has occurred, and the contents of the FPU may not be what the current task is expecting.  The flag will cause a trap when an attempt is made to use the FPU to prevent somebody from getting strange and unpredictable results.

      Hmm.  So why would the floating point exception handler set it?  As you described the handler's function, it neither switches tasks nor changes the contents of the FPU.  And it's already queued a FPE signal anyway!
<p>
Is this some weird interaction between the floating point exception handler, signal deliverer, and scheduler?
<p>
The straightforward fix seems to throw away a floating point exception that the original code intended to turn into a FPE signal to tell the user he botched the frstor.  And it's not entirely clear to me that it catches all possible cases.  Could a FP exception become pending between when the kernel clears pending exceptions and when the kernel does the fwait?  Seems like the kernel should fundamentally be able to survive a floating point exception from its own instruction.

      <p>Grrr... Read again: <i>TS ("task switched") processor flag</i>. And again: <i>TS ("task switched") <b>processor</b> flag</i>. Clear now ?</p>

<p>If not... It's <b>not</b> something by signal handler, sheduler or some other part of kernel. <b>Processor</b> (i.e. CPU) will set this flag by itself once FPU operation is executed. No program involment is needed. Idea is clear: if task does not use FPU there are no need to restore FPU state! And there are a lof of such programs... TS flag was introduced with Intel 80286(sic!) almost 20 years - way before Linux was even imagined...</p>

What makes you think that I would understand the same two words the 3rd time I read them, if I didn't the first time?  It should be obvious that it requires different words -- probably additional words -- to get this point across to me.

<p>
You do then add some information, though, in saying that this particular processor flag is set as a side effect of an FPU instruction, as opposed to by an explicit instruction, which is what Jon's "it [the kernel] also sets the TS ... processor flag" implied to me.  But the new information really makes the situation even less clear than it was.

<p>I was hoping it would be easy for someone just to post here an explanation, for someone who isn't already an expert on IA32 floating point architecture, of what Linux is trying to do and how it failed to do it.  I am certainly not the only LWN reader is this position.  However, if it is not a trivial thing to explain, then this isn't the place for it -- it's not that important.

      I can't resist trying to explain.  (And, understand, please, I am not an assembly language programmer, so I maybe have this wrong, myself, but here goes.)<p>When a programmer asks the Central Processing Unit, (CPU), or the Floating Point Processor, (FPU), to do some math, when that instruction completes the CPU/FPU sets certain flags.  The flags are single bits in one of the processor's registers, (that is bytes of memory resident in the processor itself).  The programmer doesn't set those bits, (or flags), the processor does that itself, as part of carrying out the instruction.  For example if you tell a processor to decrement a given register by one, and that causes the value in that register to go to zero, then the processor's ZF - zero flag, gets set.<p>In the case of this bug, loading the invalid FPU state info sets a flag in the FPU that says, an error has occured, the TS flag.  The bug then is that the kernel programmer assumes that this can be fixed by restoring the state of the FPU, and so trys that, but that's what caused the error in the first place and the TS flag is again set and the kernel programmer assumes... so on and so on, until some one notices and reboots the machine.  You see?<p>The Flatlander<p>Apologies to all if this truely is the wrong place for this, but it seemed a reasonable question....

      Not quite right; the TS flag indicates that some FP math has occurred 
since the TS flag was last cleared. 
<p>When it was introduced (back in 286 days) saving and restoring FP 
state unnecessarily was considered a bad idea for storage and performance 
reasons. Used the way Intel intended, the kernel clears the flag after a 
task switch; if it's set when the scheduler is next entered, the task did 
FP math, and should have its FP state saved before a new task runs. In 
addition, the kernel should track whether a task has ever done any FP 
math; if it hasn't, you needn't restore FP state before reentering the 
task.

state when it switches to a task.

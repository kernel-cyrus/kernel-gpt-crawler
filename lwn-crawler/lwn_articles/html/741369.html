<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 13, 2017</br>
           </div>
The <tt>MAP_FIXED</tt> option to the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt>
system call</a> allows a process to specify that a mapping should be placed
at a given virtual address if at all possible.  It turns out, though, that
"if at all possible" can involve a bit more collateral damage than some
would like, and can even lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.  A new, safer
option is in the works but, as is often the case, it has run into a bit of
non-technical difficulty.
<p>
Any <tt>mmap()</tt> call allows the calling process to specify an address
for the mapping.  In normal operation, though, this address is simply a
hint that the kernel is free to ignore.  <tt>MAP_FIXED</tt> exists for
cases where the mapping really has to be placed at the requested address or
the application will fail to work.  The kernel takes this flag seriously,
to the point that, if there is already another mapping in the given address
range, the existing mapping will be destroyed to make room for the new
one.  This seems like a strange semantic; if an application wants a mapping
at a given area, it should probably be able to take responsibility for
making room for that mapping.  But <tt>mmap()</tt> is specified to work
that way, so that is what happens.
<p>
Needless to say, that can be problematic if the application wasn't aware of
the conflicting mapping â€” something that could occur as the result of a
bug, address-space layout randomization, disagreements between libraries,
or deliberate manipulation by an attacker.  The data contained within that
mapping (or the 
overlapping part of it, at least) will be silently dropped on the floor and
the new mapping will show up in its place.  The chances of things working
correctly after that are likely to be fairly small.  In some cases,
security vulnerabilities can result; see, for example, <a
href="https://www.qualys.com/2017/09/26/linux-pie-cve-2017-1000253/cve-2017-1000253.txt">CVE-2017-1000253</a>.
In that case, the kernel's internal use of <tt>MAP_FIXED</tt> to load
programs into memory was exploited to corrupt the stack.
<p>
A solution can be found in Michal Hocko's <a
href="/Articles/741335/"><tt>MAP_FIXED_SAFE</tt> patch set</a>.  It adds a
new <tt>mmap()</tt> flag called, surprisingly, <tt>MAP_FIXED_SAFE</tt> with
semantics similar to 
<tt>MAP_FIXED</tt> with one exception: the operation will fail if the
targeted address range is not free.  The kernel's ELF loader is modified
to use this new flag when mapping programs into memory; that will cause
program loading to fail if two mappings collide, but that is better than
the alternative.  It is expected that new code would use this new flag in
almost all cases, and that older programs would eventually be switched as
well. 
<p>
Some had suggested adding a separate flag to modify the behavior of
<tt>MAP_FIXED</tt>, so that applications would pass something like
<tt>MAP_FIXED|MAP_SAFE</tt> to <tt>mmap()</tt>.  The problem with that
approach is that <tt>mmap()</tt> is one of those system calls that never
checked for unknown flags.  A program using that construction would, as a
result, silently fall
back to <tt>MAP_FIXED</tt> on older kernels that lacked support for
the new <tt>MAP_SAFE</tt> flag.  Using a new flag means that,
while the application will not get the desired failure status on an older
kernel if the
address range is not available, it also will not clobber any existing
mappings (because the specified address will be treated as a hint by the
kernel).
<p>
This change is pretty much ready to go, and Hocko has requested that it be
merged.  There is, however, the vital issue which has caused the most
discussion about this patch series: the naming of <tt>MAP_FIXED_SAFE</tt>.
For various reasons, various developers wanted a different name.
Suggestions included <a
href="/Articles/741375/"><tt>MAP_FIXED_UNIQUE</tt></a>,
<a href="/Articles/741376/"><tt>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</tt></a>,
<a href="/Articles/741377/"><tt>MAP_FIXED_NO_CLOBBER</tt></a>,
<a href="/Articles/741378/"><tt>MAP_TANTRUM</tt></a>,
<a href="/Articles/741379/"><tt>MAP_EXACT</tt></a>,
<a href="/Articles/741380/"><tt>MAP_NOFORCE</tt></a>, and quite a few
others.  It was just the sort of discussion that results when the technical
issues are resolved, but everybody wants to put their stamp on the final
result.
<p>
After enduring a fair amount of that discussion, Hocko made his own
decision on the naming:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I am afraid we can bikeshed this to death and there will still be
	somebody finding yet another better name. Therefore I've decided to
	stick with my original MAP_FIXED_SAFE. Why? Well, because it keeps
	the MAP_FIXED prefix which should be recognized by developers and
	_SAFE suffix should also be clear that all dangerous side effects
	of the old MAP_FIXED are gone.
</div>
<p>
He also stated that anybody who was truly unhappy with the name was
welcome to block the patch and somehow build a consensus around a better
one, but that he was done with it.  So, naturally, somebody <a
href="/Articles/741381/">objected</a>, and Hocko <a
href="/Articles/741382/">wished him luck</a> carrying the patch set
forward.
<p>
Given the personalities involved, one might think that a useful patch will
end up simply blocked at this point.  Your editor would wager, though, that
the <tt>MAP_FIXED_SAFE</tt> patches will be merged in something close to
their current form.  They address a real problem; holding them up while
waiting for the perfect name does not seem like an approach that will do
anybody any good.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>Why not do the converse of that, i.e. make <tt>MAP_FIXED</tt> <em>default</em> to the <tt>MAP_SAFE</tt> behavior as defined and implemented by Mr. Hocko's patch, and add the separate flag, e.g. <tt>MAP_RIGHT_HERE</tt> for the legacy behavior?</p>

In 2017 I don't think there is any good use for MAP_FIXED. Not only has position independence been best practice for decades, for both normal toolchains as well as bespoke applications, these days it's all but mandatory to be position independent to avoid being an exploit target.<br>
<p>
I once wrote a Bayesian SPAM token database that self-repaired file corruption. (The devices it ran on were seeing substantial hardware failures, which years later was tracked down to XFS bugs.) It used a red-black tree and thus internal pointers, and I very briefly considered MAP_FIXED; but even circa 2003 it just wasn't worth baking in such an anachronism, and even when disregarding the headaches it would impose to utilize multiple databases concurrently.<br>
<p>
But the reason the default semantics can't be changed is because of the Linux backwards compatibility guarantee. Also, while I've never used MAP_FIXED nor see myself ever using it, I don't find the semantics of silent replacement odd. dup2 has the same semantics, and for the same reasons the semantics seem quite natural and intuitive to me. It's just that back when people regularly mmap'd stuff to fixed addresses sbrk() was the primary (if not only) means of growing the heap, and static linking was the normal (if not only) method of linking. <br>

MAP_FIXED is how you properly, safely allocate virtually contiguous VMAs. This includes:<br>
 - guard pages for thread stacks<br>
 - the different sections for library mappings (you need separate VMAs for code, readonly data, copy-on-write data and zero-initialized data)<br>
<p>
Try running strace on any binary that is dynamically linked and/or uses threads, and you should see MAP_FIXED.<br>

<p>
MAP_FIXED is necessary for the proper mapping by execve() of any native ET_EXEC file.  The addresses are fixed, after all.  There are ET_EXEC files which are several percent smaller and run several percent faster than the corresponding ET_DYN.  Some environments have done a good risk-vs-benefit analysis, and for them ET_EXEC is worth it.<br>
<p>
MAP_FIXED is necessary for the proper mapping by execve() and dlopen() of any native ET_DYN file which has more than one PT_LOAD, which is nearly all of them.  The second and subsequent PT_LOADs must have fixed offsets from the first PT_LOAD.  In most cases the best strategy is to use mmap(0, size, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, FD_ANON, 0) to obtain enough contiguous space to hold the convex hull of all PT_LOAD, then mmap() each PT_LOAD into that space using MAP_FIXED.<br>
<p>
MAP_FIXED is essential for program-manipulating programs such as valgrind and upx.<br>

I have previously worked on a filesystem that provided transactional memory; we needed MAP_FIXED to keep internal addresses the same when a transactional "file" was mapped in multiple processes. We could've of course used relative addresses, but that comes with a not insignificant performance cost, and would've required some C++ magic we didn't really want to deal with.<br>

Because that would break existing, perfectly legitimate users of MAP_FIXED.<br>
<p>
Look at, for example, how glibc allocates memory for threads:<br>
<p>
$ cat thread.c<br>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;<br>
void *testfn(void *arg) { return (void*)0; }<br>
int main(void) {<br>
  pthread_t thread;<br>
  pthread_create(&amp;thread, NULL, testfn, (void*)0);<br>
  return 0;<br>
}<br>
$ gcc -o thread thread.c -Wall -pthread<br>
$ strace ./thread<br>
[...]<br>
mmap(NULL, 3795360, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0) = 0x7f9b24276000<br>
mprotect(0x7f9b2440b000, 2097152, PROT_NONE) = 0<br>
mmap(0x7f9b2460b000, 24576, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x195000) = 0x7f9b2460b000<br>
mmap(0x7f9b24611000, 14752, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f9b24611000<br>
[...]<br>
<p>
MAP_FIXED is perfectly safe as long as you only pass in address ranges that you have allocated yourself - just like other APIs, like munmap() or mprotect(), which you also shouldn't call on address ranges that haven't been allocated to you. Unlike MAP_FIXED, the suggested MAP_FIXED_SAFE is for a very uncommon usecase and actually requires more care to get right. (Which is also why MAP_FIXED_SAFE isn't exactly a good name - it suggests that it is a "safer" alternative to MAP_FIXED, which it simply isn't in what I think is probably the majority of usecases.)<br>

The idea was that if you see MAP_FIXED then you know that this particular bit of code hasn't yet been audited and changed to either SAFE or UNSAFE.  So checking your codebase is a simple grep.  I guess as you say you can "#define MAP_FIXED_UNSAFE MAP_FIXED" and then use the new keyword.<br>

Fair enough, although I do think that it should be called MAP_FIXED_SAFER, because calling it "SAFE" is almost going to guarantee an exploit at some point, and then we will need MAP_FIXED_REALLY_SAFE, and probably MAP_FIXED_SAFE_FOR_REALZ_THIS_TIME...<br>

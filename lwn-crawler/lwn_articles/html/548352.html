<h1>LSFMM: Reducing io_submit() latency</h1>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>May 1, 2013</br>

<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">LSFMM Summit 2013</a>
</div>
<p>
At the 2013 LSFMM Summit, Ankit Jain led a discussion of ways to reduce the
latency in the <tt>io_submit()</tt> system call which is used to submit asynchronous
I/O operations to the kernel.  He doesn't have a solution to
the problem that <tt>io_submit()</tt> can sometimes sleep especially when
allocating new blocks, so he was
interested in hearing from attendees on what kinds of solutions might be
available. 
</p>

<p>
Jain described a "naïve" approach he took that offloaded the processing of
all <tt>iocbs</tt> (I/O control blocks that are used to track asynchronous
I/O requests)
to workqueues. That way, the workqueue thread would block, but
<tt>io_submit()</tt> would not.  That didn't work very well for modern
flash disks.  It also 
depends on the submitter's context, and may need to be integrated with
control groups.  That led him to look at other solutions such as
filesystem-specific approaches, <a href="/Articles/261473/">syslets</a>, or
<a href="/Articles/219954/">fibrils</a>.  Jain said that
fibrils were a "neat solution" and he was not sure why they were not accepted.
</p>

<p>
Zach Brown cautioned that there is "no quick fix" for handling this problem.
There are "no magic workqueue tricks" that will solve the problem and any
path to a solution is "incredibly painful".  Beyond that, though, there is
no consensus among kernel developers as to the right direction.  Fibrils
have pain points; syslets have a different set, as do thread pools.
Essentially, Jain is asking for a "consensus that hasn't existed for five
years".  Al Viro suggested that five years was far too low; that the
consensus had eluded the kernel community for much longer than that.

<p>
Brown said that "arguably" the filesystem-specific solution is the least
work.  For ext4, allocation data structures can be pinned in memory so that
they don't need to be read at <tt>io_submit()</tt> time.  Ted Ts'o
said that solving the general case problem was so painful that it may
really make no sense to do so.  He has a solution that will eliminate
waits in block allocation as long as the file is not being extended.
There will be an occasional sleep in <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, but if that can
be lived with, his ext4-specific solution may be enough.
</p>

<p>
Solving the general problem will be very expensive in terms of development
cost, Ts'o said.  But it may also cause a lot of "spillover pain" to the
community, which may make it difficult to get it merged.  Lots of people
have looked at the problem over the years and "decided to hack it" for
their specific use case, he said.
</p>

<p>
But David Howells said that he is looking at reworking the Linux I/O
subsystem into an event-based framework.  Filesystem I/O would be broken up
into individual state machines, which would make asynchronous I/O simpler
and "completely async" rather than "semi-async".  There is quite a bit of
work to do, he said, but he thinks he can make it work and asked others who
were interested to talk to him later.
</p>

<p>
Dave Chinner stepped back to say that it was impossible to solve the
problem of knowing when an allocation will block.  There are locks taken at
multiple levels throughout the I/O stack, and rolling back a transaction
because it will block could also require locks, which could cause
blocking.  Overall, there are complex interactions that are specific to the
filesystem in question, so you would end up with "ten different solutions".
</p>

<p>
Jain suggested that fibrils would avoid those problems, but Brown said it
would just shift the problem to "scarier things".  Sharing a <tt>task</tt>
struct between multiple threads requires a code audit to ensure there
aren't concurrent access issues.  But even if that were done, it would
require eternal vigilance whenever new code is added that touches those
structures, Ts'o said.  Fibrils are a fragile solution.
</p>

<p>
Is this really a problem that needs to be solved, James Bottomley asked,
since no one has been 
bitten by it hard enough to provide resources to solve it?  Boaz Harrosh
said that threads could handle most asynchronous work as long as you don't
need "10,000 operations in parallel" because that would require too many
threads.  In general, the complaints come from database companies about the
latency of asynchronous I/O, Jan Kara said.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the database companies just want a way to submit writes to many
disjoint blocks, Brown said.  If there were an interface like
<tt>writev()</tt> that 
also did file positioning in addition to scatter-gather, that would
probably be good enough.  The database companies just want to be able to kick
off many concurrent asynchronous I/O operations, so a new system call to do
so would likely keep them happy.
</p>

<p>
There was a bit of talk about various patches that might or might not help
the problem, but the overall sense was that there is no easy (or even hard)
solution to 
Jain's problem.

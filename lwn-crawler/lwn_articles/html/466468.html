<p>
One of the <a href="/Articles/464233/">outcomes</a> from the kernel.org compromise is the
increased use of GPG among kernel developers.  GPG keys are now required to
get write access to the kernel.org Git repositories, and folks are starting
to think about how to use those keys for other things.  Authenticating pull
requests made by kernel hackers to Linus Torvalds are one possible
use. But, as the discussion on the linux-kernel mailing list shows, there
are a few different use-cases that 
might benefit from cryptographic signing.
</p>

<p>
Most of the code that flows into the kernel these days comes from
Git trees that various lieutenants or maintainers manage.  During the merge
window (and at other times), Torvalds is asked to "pull" changes from these
trees via an email from the maintainer.  In the past, Torvalds has used some
<i>ad hoc</i> heuristics to determine whether to trust that the request (and the
tree) are valid, but, these days, stronger assurances are needed.
That's where GPG signing commits and tags may be able to help.
</p>

<p>
Conceptually the idea is simple: the basic information required to do a
pull (location and branch of the Git tree along with the commit ID of its
head) could 
be signed by the developer requesting the pull.  Torvalds could then use
GPG with
his keyring of kernel developer public keys to verify that the signature is
valid for the person who sent the request.  That would ensure that the pull
request is valid.  It could all be done manually, of course, but it could
also be automated by making some changes to Git.
</p>

<p>
The discussion on how to do that automation started after a <a
href="/Articles/466549/">signed pull 
request</a> for libata updates was posted by Jeff Garzik.  The entire pull request
mail (some 3200+ lines including the diffs and diffstat) was GPG signed,
which mangled the diff output as Garzik noted.  Beyond that,
though, it is unwieldy for Torvalds to check the signature, partly because
he uses the GMail web interface.  In order to check it, he has to cut and
paste the entire message and feed it to GPG, which is labor intensive and
might be prone to the message being mangled&mdash;white space or other changes&mdash;that would lead to a false negative signature verification.  As
Torvalds <a href="/Articles/466550/">noted</a>: "<q>We need to automate this some sane way, both for the
sender and for the recipient.</q>" 
</p>

<p>
The initial goal is just to find a way to ensure that Torvalds knows who
the pull 
request is coming from and where to get it, all of which could be handled
outside of Git.  Rather than signing the entire pull request email, just a
small, fixed-format piece of that mail could be signed.  In fact, Torvalds
<a href="/Articles/466573/">posted</a> a patch to <tt>git-request-pull</tt>
to do just that.  It still leaves the integrator (either Torvalds or a
maintainer who is getting a pull request from another developer) doing a
cut-and-paste into GPG for verification, however.

<p>
There are others who have an interest in a permanent trail of signatures
that could be audited if the provenance of a particular part of the kernel
needs to be traced.  That would require storing the signatures inside the
Git tree somehow, so that anyone with a copy of Torvalds's tree could see
any of the commits that had been signed, either by Torvalds or by some
other kernel hacker.  But, as Torvalds <a href="/Articles/466576/">pointed
out</a>, that information is only rarely useful:
<div class="BigQuote">
 Having thought about it, I'm also not convinced I really want to
pollute the "git log" output with information that realistically
almost nobody cares about. The primary use is just for the person who
pulls things to verify it, after that the information is largely stale
and almost certain to never be interesting to anybody ever again. It's
*theoretically* useful if somebody wants to go back and re-verify, but
at the same time that really isn't expected to be the common case.
</div>

</p>

<p>
Torvalds's idea is that the generation of the pull request is the proper time for a developer
to sign something, rather than having it tied to a specific commit.  His
example is that a developer or maintainer may wish to push the tree out for
testing (or to linux-next), which requires that it be committed, but then
request a pull for that same commit if it passes the tests.  Signing before
testing has been done is likely to be a waste of time, but signing the
commit later requires amending the commit or adding a new empty commit on
top, neither of which were very palatable. Git maintainer
Junio C. Hamano is <a href="/Articles/466578/">not convinced</a> that
ephemeral signatures (i.e. those that only exist for the pull-request) are
the right way to go, though: "<q>But my gut feeling is that 'usually hidden not to disturb normal users,
but is cast in stone in the history and cannot be lost' strikes the right
balance.</q>"
</p>

<p>
The conversation then turned toward tags, which can already be signed with
a GPG key.  One of the problems is that creating a separate tag for each
commit that gets signed rapidly becomes a logistical nightmare.  If you
just consider the number of trees that Torvalds pulls in a normal merge
window (hundreds), the growth in the number of signed tags becomes
unwieldy quickly.  If you start considering all of the sub-trees that get
pulled into the trees that Torvalds pulls, it becomes a combinatorial
explosion of tags.
</p>

<p>
What's needed is an automated method of creating tag-like entries that live
in a different namespace.  That's more or less what Hamano <a
href="/Articles/466579/">proposed</a> by adding a <tt>refs/audit</tt>
hierarchy into the <tt>.git</tt> directory data structures. The audit objects would act much like tags, but
instead carry along information about the signature verification status of
the merges that result from pulls.  In other words, a <tt>git-pull</tt>
would verify the signature associated with the remote tag (which are often
things like "for-linus" that get reused over and over) and create an entry
in the local audit hierarchy 
that recorded the verification.  Since the audit objects wouldn't pollute
the tag namespace, and would be pulled and created automatically, they will
have much less of an impact on users and existing tools.  In addition,
the audit objects could then be pushed
into Torvalds's public tree so that audits could be done.
</p>

<p>
So far, Hamano has <a href="/Articles/466517/">posted</a> a patch set that
implements parts of his proposed solution.  In particular, it allows for
signing commits, verifying the signatures, and for pulling signed tags.
Other pieces of the problem are still being <a
href="/Articles/466582/">worked on</a>. 
</p>

<p>
As is often the case in our communities, adversity results in pretty rapid
improvements.  For the kernel, the SCO case brought about the Developer's Certificate of
Origin, the relicensing of BitKeeper gave us Git, the kernel.org
break-in brought about a closer scrutiny of security practices, and the adoption
of GPG keys because of that break-in will likely lead to even better
assurances of the provenance of kernel code.  While we certainly don't want
to court adversity, we certainly do take advantage of it when it happens.

The discussion in the "Re: [git patches] libata updates, GPG signed (but see admin notes)" thread on git mailing list is ongoing, but partial solutions that actually got implemented and have good chance to be accepted are:<br>
<p>
* Signing commits (signature is hidden in commit object header, and stripped e.g. on rebase or amend)<br>
<p>
* Puling signed tags, with merge and editing of its commit message enforced, and with saving the whole tag in commit object header for merge commit.  Using "git pull &lt;URL&gt; &lt;tag&gt;" won't result in creating a new tag reference.<br>

One problem is that some people don't have/want their signing keys available all the time. I.e. they want commits to be lightweight, because signing them is heavy (may require another computer, or at least extra passwords.)<br>

And that's what "we certainly don't want to court adversity" means.

GPG signing of emails has been around for more then 10 years but almost no one still does it. Now after a few break ins people are discovering something that they should had been doing 10 years ago, really this is a sorry state of things.  <br>
<p>
It's sad that a company like Google still does not allow GPG with there web mail interface, that said everyone knows why.  The use of GPG signing would most likely eliminate Spam and this would change company's like Groupon forever.  Knowing who sent a email makes email filtering easy and how do email providers give you something to make there product look better then others. <br>
<p>
Even among top kernel developers we have such a slow rate of adoption GPG should have been every where 10 years ago, but still Spam continues to slow this rate of adoption. I am always amazed.      <br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; It's sad that a company like Google still does not allow GPG with there web mail interface...</font><br>
<p>
Since when? I've never heard of people having trouble sending GPG-signed messages via the web interface. Sure, they don't integrate the feature, but you can always paste an ASCII-armored signed message, or use an extension like FireGPG. Anyway, would you really want Google to have access to your private signing key? They'd need it for that level of integration.<br>

They could have a setting where you give your fingerprints and then the interface can mark emails based on trustworthiness given the public chain of trust with the keys. Sure, signing in-browser is something I'd never do, but *verifying*...that should be possible.<br>

Oh, I agree that public key management and verification in the web client could be useful (though it could also be subverted more easily than a local GPG installation and keyring). Integration with the key server network, links between contacts and public keys, etc., would be very convenient, provided you could trust it. You wouldn't be able to decrypt anything, but perhaps you only want to verify signed cleartext.<br>
<p>
However, you'd still need GPG on your own system to send signed messages, and a local public keyring for encryption. Once you have that plus a browser extension like FireGPG, how much extra benefit would the direct integration bring?<br>

When I'm using someone else's computer to check email? Like I said, I'd never trust my browser to touch my private keyring, so that isn't a question for me. Friends who know approximately nothing of GPG could get a message stating that there is *some* reason to expect that the email I sent is actually from me other than the From header.<br>
<p>
This brings up the problem that there needs to be a way to communicate that a signature is expected. Anything in the mail doesn't work, so there needs to be some server-side implementation for this.<br>

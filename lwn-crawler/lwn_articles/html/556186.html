<p>
The Ftrace kernel tracing facility has long had the ability to turn on or off tracing based on hitting
a certain function (the trigger) during the trace.  For 3.10, several new
trigger commands that allow even more control over the tracing process were
added, but can only be triggered by function entry. 
A recent <a href="/Articles/555884/">patch set</a > from Tom Zanussi would
extend 
the Ftrace trigger feature to apply more widely so that the triggers could be
specified for any tracepoint.  Triggers allow the user to reduce the amount
of tracing information gathered, so that narrowing in on the behavior of
interest is easier.

<p>
In 3.10, <a
href="/Articles/543216/">patches</a> by
Steven Rostedt add several trigger actions to Ftrace 
that will allow triggers to create a
snapshot of the tracing buffers, add a stack trace to the buffers, or
to disable and enable other trace events when the trigger is hit.  Any of
those  (and the long-available traceon and traceoff trigger
actions) can be associated with a particular function call in the kernel,
but not with an arbitrary trace event.  The latter is what Zanussi's
patches would allow. 
</p>

<p>
Tracepoints can be placed by kernel developers in locations of interest
for debugging or other kinds of monitoring; when an active tracepoint is
hit while 
tracing is active, it will generate a trace event that gets stored in the
tracing buffers.
Some tracepoints have been 
added permanently to the kernel, but others can be placed <i>ad hoc</i> to
provide extra information, particularly when tracking down a bug.
In contrast, the function
entry events are placed automatically at build time when Ftrace is enabled
in the 
kernel. In both cases, the tracepoints are disabled until a user enables them
through the debugfs interface. 
</p>

<p>
Disabling or enabling a tracepoint is a fairly intrusive process that involves
modifying the code at the tracepoint site.  That, in turn, requires the use
of <tt>stop_machine()</tt>, which will stop execution on all other CPUs in
the system so that the modified code properly propagates to the entire
system.  But a trigger can fire on any function call (or, with Zanussi's
patches, any tracepoint), so there needs to be a way to enable and disable
tracepoints that doesn't 
require taking any locks or sleeping.  That constraint led Rostedt to add a
way to <a 
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=417944c4c7a0f657158d0515f3b8e8c043fd788f">"soft
disable" trace events</a>.  
Tracepoints are simply marked as disabled using a flag, 
rather than modifying the code itself, which means that the function handling the trace event
will be called but will
immediately return.  Any tracepoints that might be
enabled by a trigger are initialized at the time the trigger is set, but
marked as soft disabled until the triggering event is hit.
</p>

<p>
All of the trigger capabilities are aimed at narrowing in on a particular
behavior (typically a bug) of interest.  The pre-3.10 triggers only allowed
using the "big hammer" of disabling and enabling tracing itself, while
these new trigger actions provide more fine-grained control.  For example,
using the "snapshot" trigger action will create a snapshot of the existing
tracing buffer in a separate file while continuing the trace.  Rostedt
shows an example in his <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8d016091d10953e00f9d2c0125cc0ddd46c23a6a">update
to <tt>Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt</tt></a>:
<pre>
    # in the tracing debugfs directory, typically /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
    echo 'native_flush_tlb_others:snapshot:1' &gt; set_ftrace_filter
</pre>
That command will trigger a snapshot, once (that's what the "<tt>:1</tt>"
does), when the 
<tt>native_flush_tlb_others()</tt> function is called.
</p>

<p>
Or to enable a specific event:
<pre>
    echo 'try_to_wake_up:enable_event:sched:sched_switch:2' &gt; set_ftrace_filter
</pre>
That will enable the <tt>sched_switch</tt> event in the <tt>sched</tt>
subsystem when the <tt>try_to_wake_up()</tt> function is
called. The event will be enabled the first two times that
<tt>try_to_wake_up()</tt> is called,  presumably some other trigger is
disabling the event in 
between.
</p>

<p>
Zanussi's patches (which come with good documentation and examples, both in
the introductory patch and an <a href="/Articles/556254/">update to
<tt>Documentation/trace/events.txt</tt></a>) apply those same triggers to
the events interface.  Thus the <tt>kmem:kmalloc</tt> event can be enabled
when the <tt>read()</tt> system call is entered as follows:
<pre>
    # again from /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
    echo 'enable_event:kmem:kmalloc:1' &gt; events/syscalls/sys_enter_read/trigger
</pre>
That will also cause the event to be soft disabled until the trigger is
hit, which can be verified by:
<pre>
    cat events/kmem/kmalloc/enable
</pre>
That will show a "0*" as output, which means that the event is soft disabled.
</p>

<p>
But there is more that can be done using triggers.  The trace events filter
interface allows tests to 
be performed to filter the tracing output,
and Zanussi's patches extend that to the trigger feature.  So adding a
stack backtrace to the tracing buffer for the first five
<tt>kmem:kmalloc</tt> events where the bytes requested value is 512 or more
could 
be done this way:
<pre>
     echo 'stacktrace:5 if bytes_req &gt;= 512' &gt; events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger
</pre>
One can check on the status of the trigger using:
<pre>
    cat events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger
</pre>
which would show:
<pre>
    stacktrace:count=2 if bytes_req &gt;= 512
</pre>
if three of the five stack backtraces had been emitted into the tracing
buffer (<tt>count=2</tt>). 
</p>

<p>
The triggers and tests can be mixed and matched in various ways, but
there are some restrictions.  There can only be one
stacktrace or snapshot trigger per event and each event can only have one
traceon and traceoff trigger.  A triggering event can have multiple
enable_event and 
disable_event triggers, but each must refer to a different event to be enabled
or disabled.  So <tt>sys_enter_read</tt> could enable two different events (with two different commands echoed into its <tt>trigger</tt>
file) but the events so enabled must be distinct.
</p>

<p>
The Ftrace triggers will be released soon with 3.10.  Zanussi's patches are
still in the review stage.  Given that the 3.11 merge window will likely
open soon, triggers for all events will probably have to wait for 3.12.

</div>
A typical cloud-computing host will share some of its memory with each
guest that it runs.  The host retains its access to that memory, though,
meaning that it can readily dig through that memory in search of data that
the guest would prefer to keep private.  The <a
href="/Articles/949277/">guest_memfd subsystem</a> removes (most of) the
host's access to guest memory, making the guest's data more secure.  In the
memory-management track of the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF Summit, David Hildenbrand ran a discussion on
the state and future of this feature.
<p>
Once upon a time, he said, virtual machines (VMs) were easy; they only had one
type of memory provided by the host.  In confidential-computing circles,
this memory is deemed "shared", since it is accessible by both the guest
and the host.  More recently, the advent of confidential VMs has added the
concept of private memory, which is only accessible to the guest.  In
hardware-backed implementations, an attempt to access guest-private memory
by the host might even cause a machine check, stopping the show entirely.
Private memory cannot (on the host) be mapped into user space, swapped out,
or migrated.
<p>
A participant asked whether DMA access by devices attached to the host was
supported.  In general, Hildenbrand said, that access is not allowed, but
there is a "private device" concept that is being developed.  Dan Williams
said that the entire security model around private devices is that the
device sets a "<q>trusted bit</q>" — to general laughter in the room.
<p>
Hildenbrand said that private memory differs from the usual variety in
numerous ways.  It cannot be mapped, read from, or written to by the host,
and often can be managed with small folios only.  Jason Gunthorpe noted
that every architecture implements private memory differently.  Moving
memory between the private and shared states, Hildenbrand said, can be
challenging, and often can double the memory consumption of the guest.
Conversion between types is usually done on individual 4KB base pages,
splitting up huge pages.
<p>
Current upstream work, he said, is aiming to integrate the concepts of
both private and shared memory within guest_memfd; that would facilitate
conversion between the two types.  Fuad Tabba has been <a
href="/ml/all/20250318161823.4005529-1-tabba@google.com/">doing some
work</a> in this area.  Getting there requires support for host-side memory
mapping in guest_memfd; it would allow the host to easily access shared
pages, but the host will still get a bus error if it attempts to access a
private page.
<p>
Converting pages from private to shared is always possible, Hildenbrand said, but
the other way is harder.  It is important to avoid having any private pages
mapped into user space on the host, so the host must take pains to ensure
that there are no unexpected references to any pages that are about to be
made private.  That is easy with small folios, because there is a single
reference count to check, but the situation is more complicated with huge
pages.
<p>
There is some work underway, he said, by Ackerley Tng and Vishal Annapurve
to improve huge-page support.  It will allocate memory from the hugetlb
subsystem, but then convert it into normal folios that can be mapped or
split, if need be, to change smaller pieces between shared and private.
Once the memory is freed, the huge folio is reconstructed and returned to
hugetlb.
<p>
Lorenzo Stoakes asked what the use case was for converting private memory
back to shared; the answer is that VMs do need to make memory available to
the hypervisor, often for device I/O.  The discussion wandered for a while
after that, including a suggestion that hugetlb should eventually be
removed — a task that is <a href="/Articles/974491/">being worked on</a>.
<p>
In the absence of hardware support, guest_memfd can still support some
device privacy by removing the private memory from the host's direct map,
leaving the host with no way to address it.  The result is not really
confidential, but it provides some protection, Hildenbrand said.  There is
a problem, though: the memory-management developers do not want to expose
the APIs that modify the direct map to loadable modules.  But guest_memfd
is implemented within KVM, which can be built as a loadable module.  There
were some suggestions of using the <a href="/Articles/998221/">restricted
namespaces</a> feature to limit access to this API.  Restricted namespaces
have not yet found their way into the mainline, though.
<p>
As the session ran out of time, Hildenbrand said that there would
eventually need to be some sort of callback that could intercept
folio-freeing operations.  If the folio being freed has been shared out of
a guest_memfd, the kernel will have to put it back where it came from,
rather than making it generally available.  This interception is currently
done by testing for a specific folio subtype, but there are locking-related
problems with that solution.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The post tells several times that this feature prevents page mapping from the host user space, which is nice<br>
<p>
Does it also prevent such maps from the host kernel space ?<br>
If not, would not this feature kind of useless (as the cloud provider can run whatever kernel he wants)<br>

The processor prevents accesses from both kernel and user space. Because violations can be reported a bit "violently" (machine checks) guest_memfd prevents mapping from user space, whereas the kernel looks after itself and avoids accesses.<br>

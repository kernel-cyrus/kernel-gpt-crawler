           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 10, 2016</br>

One of the heuristics that guide kernel development says that, whenever
possible, the addition of tuning knobs should be resisted.  Such knobs are
seen as the developer giving up and pushing a tuning problem onto users;
instead, the kernel should, whenever possible, tune itself to suit the
current workload.  An attempt to reduce the user's tuning responsibilities
for the networking subsystem is running into resistance, though.
<p>
Arguably, no part of the kernel offers more opportunities for user tuning
than networking.  Queuing disciplines and traffic control allow the
creation of elaborate, in-kernel routing for packets.  Interrupt affinities
and device polling can be tweaked, there are numerous congestion-control
algorithms to choose between, queue lengths and packet-ring sizes can be
played with, and so on.  There is also a whole set of policies and knobs
that can be set within the network interfaces themselves.
  The result is a subsystem with a great deal of
flexibility, but also one that is complex and difficult for most people to
tune properly.  Thus, many administrators do not even try if they can avoid
it.  Unfortunately, they often cannot avoid it; as Ken Liang noted in the
introduction to his <a href="/Articles/696458/">kernel NET policy patch
set</a>, "<q>network performance is not good with default system
settings.</q>"
<p>
That patch set introduces a new high-level policy mechanism; the
administrator can use it to describe the sort of workload that the
networking subsystem should be tuned for.  The options are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>CPU</b>: the most important factor is reducing the amount of
     CPU time needed to keep up with the network.
<p>
<li> <b>Latency</b>: the latency of network communications should be kept
     to a minimum.
<p>
<li> <b>Throughput</b>: the goal is to push the maximum amount of data
     through the network.
</ul>
<p>
These policies may be set at a per-interface level, in which case they
apply to all communications flowing through the affected interface.
Policies can also be set on a per-task and per-socket level, though,
allowing different users to operate under different policies.  In this
case, the interface-level policy must be set to the special "mixed"
option; if the interface is given any other policy, all communications
through that interface must match that policy.
<p>
Exactly how these policies are implemented is not well documented in the
patch set; that is not helped by the fact that, in the current version,
there are no driver-level patches implementing the new policy-setting
hooks.  That support can be seen in <a href="/Articles/694754/">a previous
version of the patch set</a>; it was seemingly removed in response to
complaints about the length of the series as a whole.  Therein, one sees
that much of the functionality is dependent on Intel's "Ethernet Flow
Director" technology, though Liang maintains that it can be made to work on
any adapter that supports loadable flow-direction rules — as many high-end
adapters do.
<p>
One aspect of the policy implementation is interrupt mitigation.  Most
high-speed network adapters can handle vast numbers (as in millions) of
packets per second; if they generated interrupts for every packet sent or
received, the system would be swamped.  So these adapters support various
mechanisms for reducing the number of interrupts delivered.  This is where
the policy comes in: reducing the number of interrupts raised by the
interface can 
increase the amount of time it takes to process a packet, thus increasing
latency.  So a latency-sensitive policy will tolerate more interrupts,
while a CPU-conserving policy will reduce interrupts to a minimum.
<p>
Multi-queue devices (the only type supported by this patch set) can steer
packets to specific queues and vary their interrupt behavior for each.
Multiple queues can be used to support policy goals in other ways as well;
throughput-oriented queues can be longer and run at lower priority, while
latency-oriented queues should be high-priority and short.  So the other
aspect of the NET policy patches is queue-selection logic that depends on the
policy attached to each packet.  When a policy is established, the queues
(and their CPU/interrupt affinities) are set up automatically, so the
administrator need not deal with that sort of complexity.
<p>
It will surprise few readers to learn that a number of networking
developers expressed concerns about this patch set.  Policy implementation
in the kernel is generally something that developers try to avoid; the
kernel is meant to implement mechanism, leaving policy decisions to
others.  Given that most of what the NET policy patches do can already be
done from user space, some questioned why the remaining bits weren't added
to the API so that policy selection could be done outside of the kernel.
<p>
The answer to this question, as found in the cover letter to the series,
goes something like this.  User space does not have access to the same
level of information that the kernel has, and the information that is
available can be stale and subject to race conditions.  If you do push
these decisions out to user space, you'll add more context switches and
slow down the system as a whole.  And only the kernel can manage competing
requests from multiple users in a way that's fair to all.  The networking
developers understand these arguments, but not everybody seems convinced
that solving the problem in user space is impossible.
<p>
Also, perhaps inevitably, it was suggested that, rather than coding queue
selection into the policy code, that decision could be <a
href="/Articles/696861/">made by an eBPF program</a> loaded from user
space.  Using eBPF would certainly add flexibility to the system, but it
seems unlikely to make the task of policy administration easier.
<p>
As things stand now, it seems clear that quite a bit more effort will be
required to convince the network development community that the NET policy
patches are the best solution to the problem.  But the problem itself is
real; as Stephen Hemminger <a href="/Articles/696862/">put it</a>,
"<q>network tuning is hard, most people get it wrong, and nobody agrees
on the right answer.</q>"  Creating a set of canned policies in the
kernel may not be the best solution to the problem, but the real proof of
that would be to come up with a better solution, and those seem to be in
short supply at the moment.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

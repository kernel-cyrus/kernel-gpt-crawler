<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2015/">LSFMM 2015</a>
</div>
<p>
In the final combined storage-and-filesystem session at the 2015 LSFMM
Summit, Zach Brown and Martin Petersen teamed up to describe the state of
and plans for supporting copy offload, which is a way of handing the work
of copying a file to a filesystem or lower-level storage device, where the
task can often be optimized.   The
functionality has been available in storage devices for eight years or so, Brown said.
</p>

<p>
The current strategy is to add a new system call,
<tt>copy_file_range()</tt>, that takes two file descriptors with pointers
to offsets and lengths, Brown said.  As the later discussion indicated,
those file descriptors could be for files on different filesystems, but
some feel that they should be restricted to a single filesystem. The big difference from earlier
proposals is that callers are now required to create the destination file.
That avoids some race conditions in the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer.
</p>

</a>

<p>
The remaining contentious parts for the system call are minor, he continued.  For example,
a flag value for the length could indicate that the entire source file
should be copied.  There is a "whole world of shit
we can argue about", he said, since there are 32 bits worth of flag values
available.
The contentious piece is on the block side, he said.  Petersen has added support, but
the device mapper developers did not like the approach he took.  

<p>
For Btrfs,
the system call is a wrapper around the existing <tt>ioctl()</tt>, though
there are some alignment issues still to be worked out.  Chris Mason said
that for Btrfs there are different options for doing copy offload.
Creating a directory subvolume is a constant-time operation that can make a copy of
an entire
file (using copy on write or COW).  
Making a file copy directly, which could support a range in the file (again,
using COW),  is proportional to the
number of extents in the file.  Brown 
suggested that under the covers Btrfs could implement the copy as a
subvolume creation
if the copy is for a whole file.
</p>

<p>
Ric Wheeler seemed to sum up the feeling of many when he said that
"anything that works is better than years of nothing" for copy-offload support.
</p>

<p>
Petersen said that SCSI support for copy offload has advanced since last
year, even though he had said it was done then.  It now supports more
features.  There are some patches that add copy-offload support to the
device mapper <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/device-mapper/kcopyd.txt">kcopyd</a>
(dm-kcopyd), though he "did not agree with the approach exactly".  He has
also added support for token-based copy offload, where device-generated
tokens are used to identify the data of interest at the storage level.  The
block and SCSI support for 
copy offload has just been waiting for a user other than dm-kcopyd, he said.
</p>

alt="[Martin Petersen]" title="Martin Petersen" width=250 height=280>
</a>

<p>
Brown noted that callers of <tt>copy_file_range()</tt> could perhaps get an
error return if the underlying storage did not support copy offload.  That
way the caller could decide whether to fall back to a regular copy or not.  A flag
could be added to the call to do that fallback in the kernel, too.
</p>

<p>
The new system call would allow copying between files between two different mounted
filesystems as long as both support copy offload, at least conceptually, but
Christoph Hellwig thought that 
should be left for an add-on patch.  All of the existing system calls will
only work within a single mountpoint, he said, so making an exception needs
to be considered carefully.  
Wheeler said that being able to do copies
between mountpoints is a powerful feature, but Hellwig thought it should
wait until someone actually needs that functionality and can provide a good
implementation.  It is never a problem to relax restrictions on system
calls, Hellwig said. 
</p>

<p>
The cross-filesystem copying feature is most important for network filesystems, Hellwig said.
Wheeler disagreed, saying that it is 
also important for local filesystems.  Hellwig said there needs to be a
well-thought-out interface, so that users don't get locked into
<tt>ioctl()</tt>-based mechanisms.  Block-based filesystems could defer to
the lower-level copy-offload support, he suggested.  There is "more than
one way to skin the cat; we just have to find a cat that we can skin", Dave
Chinner said with a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
Step one should be to get the single-mountpoint system call implementation
in, Hellwig said. 
Getting the block-layer support in should be step two. "Anything more fancy
can follow".  He also thought that token-based copies "make zero sense"
from a user-interface perspective.  That should be hidden in the lower
levels.  Finally, there should be an asynchronous interface with a
notification when the operation completes.
</p>

<p>
The sense in the room was that copy-offload support is nearing inclusion
after being discussed for several years at LSFMM.  We will have to wait and
see what gets into the mainline or whether copy offload will be on the
agenda at next year's summit in Raleigh, North Carolina.

I had been wondering why it wasn't spelled "sendfile", although I suppose it could be because sendfile only has one offset and zero flags... but still it would also seem a natural place to put these kinds of optimizations.<br>

Splice and Sendfile read data and then the data gets written to the destination.<br>
<p>
copy offload really shines when the underlying storage can do the work without actually needing to read/write the data. For a log based filesystem (like btrfs), the ability to 'just update some pointers' rather than having to read/write the entire file is extremely powerful.<br>
<p>
With network storage, there are a lot of cases where you may have a massively large file (think uncompressed video files) that need to be backed up, copied to different places to give different people access to them, or snapshotted for other processes to then make minor tweaks to (that may not touch large portions of the file)<br>
<p>
think cp -l on steroids. <br>

I dont see why sendfile nor splice cant do the copy offloading automatically if/when it's possible.  It'd be nice if the socket/pipe only restrictions are dropped from sendfile and splice.<br>
<p>
Hopefully there will at least be a wrapper at some like this...<br>
<p>
int copy_dont_care_how_but_be_quick_about_it(fd1, fd2, ...);<br>
<p>
It it can COW, great, do it.  If it can offload copy, great, do that.  If it can only do read/write system calls, fine, whatever, just do it.<br>

I wouldn't expect this to work (efficiently) with arbitrary offsets.  At a minimum most filesystems would probably need the offsets to be block aligned.<br>

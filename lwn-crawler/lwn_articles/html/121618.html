<h1>Yet another approach to memory fragmentation</h1>

A number of developers have taken a stab at the problem of memory
fragmentation and the allocation of large, contiguous blocks of memory in
the kernel.  Approaches covered on this page recently include Marcelo
Tosatti's <a href="/Articles/105021/">active defragmentation</a> patch and
Nick Piggin's <a href="/Articles/101230/">kswapd improvements</a>.  Now Mel
Gorman has jumped into the fray with a different take on the problem.

<p>

At a very high level, the kernel organizes free pages as shown in the
diagram below.  
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/mmzone1.png" width=458 height=181 
alt="[cheesy memory diagram]" border=0>
</center>
<p>
The system's physical memory is split into zones; on
an x86 systems, the zones include the small space reachable by ISA devices
(<tt>ZONE_DMA</tt>), the regular memory zone (<tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt>), and
memory not directly accessible by the kernel (<tt>ZONE_HIGHMEM</tt>).  NUMA
systems divide things further by creating zones for each node.  Within each
node, memory is split into chunks and sorted depending on its "order" - the base-2
logarithm of the size of each block.  For each order, there is a linked list
of available blocks of that size.  So, at the bottom of the array, the
order-0 list contains individual pages; the order-1 list has pairs of
pages, etc., up to the maximum order handled by the system.  When a request
for an allocation of a given order arrives, a block is taken off the
appropriate list.  If no blocks of that size are available, a larger block
is split.  When blocks are freed, the buddy allocator tries to coalesce
them with neighboring blocks to recreate higher-order chunks.
<p>

In real-life Linux systems, over time, the larger blocks tend to get split
up, to the point that larger allocations can become difficult.  A look at
<tt>/proc/buddyinfo</tt> on a running system will tend to show quite a few
zero-order pages available (one hopes), but relatively few larger blocks.
For this reason, high-order allocations have a high probability of failure
on a system which has been up for a while.

<p>

Mel's <a href="/Articles/121600/">approach</a> is to split memory allocations into three types, as
indicated by a new set of <tt>GFP_</tt> flags which can be provided when
memory is requested.  Memory allocations marked by <tt>__GFP_USERRCLM</tt>
are understood to be for user space, and to be easily reclaimable.  In
general, all that's required to reclaim a user-space page is to write it to
backing store (if it has been modified).  The <tt>__GFP_KERNRCLM</tt> flag
marks reclaimable kernel memory, such as that obtained from slabs and used
in caches which can, when needed, be dropped.  Finally, allocations not
otherwise marked are considered to not be reclaimable in any easy way.
<p>

Then, the buddy allocator's data structures are expanded to look something
like this:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/mmzone-mg.png" width=532 height=342 
alt="[The Gorman approach to buddy allocators]" border=0>
</center>
<p>
When the allocator is initialized, and all that nice, virgin memory is
still unfragmented, the <tt>free_area_global</tt> field points to a long
list of maximally-sized blocks of memory.  The three <tt>free_area</tt>
arrays - one for each type of allocation - are initially empty.  Each
allocation request, when it arrives, will be satisfied from the associated
<tt>free_area</tt> array if possible; otherwise, one of the
<tt>MAX_ORDER</tt> blocks from <tt>free_area_global</tt> will be split up.
The portion of that block which is not allocated will be placed in the
array associated with the current memory allocation type. 
<p>

When memory is freed and blocks are coalesced, they remain within the
type-specific array until they reach the largest size, at which point they
go back onto the global array.

<p>
One immediate benefit from this organization is that the pages which are
hardest to get back - those in the "kernel non-reclaimable" category - are
grouped together into their own blocks.  A single pinned page can prevent
the coalescing of a large block, so segregating the difficult kernel pages
makes the management of the rest of memory easier.  Beyond that, this
organization makes it possible to perform active page freeing.  If a
high-order request cannot be satisfied, simply start with a smaller block
and free up the neighboring pages.  Active freeing is not yet implemented in
Mel's current patch, however.

<p>
Even without the active component, this patch helps the kernel to satisfy
large allocations.  Mel gives results from a memory-thrashing test he ran;
with a vanilla kernel, only three out of 160 attempted order-10 allocations
were successful.  With a patched kernel, instead, 81 attempts succeeded.
So the new allocation technique and data structures do help the situation.
What happens next remains to be seen, however; there seems to be a big
hurdle to overcome when trying to get high-order allocation patches
merged.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I have a question. I hope I am not too rude.
i am trying to understand whether high memory is visible in interrupt context ?

When sending/getting a buffer to disk or NIC from an application that mapped high memory pages ( > 1GB ) are they copied to a normal memory and then copied to the user buffer ?

Thank you.

      Ultimately, the high-memory pages will be mapped temporarily into the   <br>
kernel address space.   <br>
   <br>
Driver writers have the option of using a buffer in normal memory and   <br>
copy_to_user()/copy_from_user() functions to transfer data to/from  <br>
userspace.  These functions hide the details of the virtual address  <br>
mapping.  <br>
  <br>
Alternatively the driver can use get_user_pages() to 'pin' the userspace  <br>
pages into memory and kmap() to get the kernel address of each page.  <br>
kmap() will return the fixed address of a normal page, or map a high  <br>
memory page into the kernel.  The pages must be released afterwards with  <br>
kunmap() (a noop if the page is normal) and page_cache_release().  <br>

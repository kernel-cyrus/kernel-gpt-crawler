<p>
Kui-Feng Lee spoke early in the BPF track at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> about some of the
recent improvements to BPF. These changes were largely driven by the
sched_ext work that David Vernet had <a href="/Articles/974387">covered in
the previous talk</a>. Lee focused on changes relevant to <tt>struct_ops</tt>
programs, but several of those changes apply to all BPF programs.
</p>

<p>
There are several mechanisms to attach BPF programs to the kernel at various
points. One such mechanism is <tt>struct_ops</tt>, which
lets a subsystem define a structure full of function pointers that can then have
functions defined in BPF (only from the same compiled program)
attached to them. When a user writes a BPF program, they
declare an instance of that structure in a special section of the compiled
program. When the BPF program
is loaded, the kernel uses the contents of that section to populate the
structure on the kernel side. BPF uses a different calling convention than the
kernel, so the <tt>struct_ops</tt> structure is actually filled with function
pointers to a set of newly allocated trampolines that perform the conversion.
This is a flexible mechanism, but sometimes
not quite flexible enough — occasionally, the user wants to override the value
of some member of the structure at run time, based on the current state of the system.
The first new feature Lee spoke about addresses that problem by allowing
user space to "shadow" members of the structure. The user-space loading code
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/20240229064523.2091270-1-thinker.li%40gmail.com/">
now has functions available</a>
to override <tt>struct_ops</tt> members before loading
the BPF program.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/974944">

class="lthumb" alt="[Kui-Feng Lee]" title="Kui-Feng Lee"
>
</a>

<p>
The size of the <tt>struct_ops</tt> structure has been fairly limited for a
while, because BPF function pointers can't just be put in the structure
directly. The BPF subsystem uses trampolines to convert between the kernel's
calling convention and BPF's calling convention. Until recently, the BPF code
has only allocated one page for trampolines. On x86, this limits
<tt>struct_ops</tt> structures to 20 entries. Now, Lee said, the code supports
up to eight pages for trampolines, greatly increasing the usable size.
</p>

<p>
Another small feature is support for verifier-tracked null pointers as
arguments. Previously, the verifier assumed that arguments passed to BPF
functions by the kernel were valid pointers — so it would let those values be
dereferenced without a check, potentially causing problems if the kernel passed a
program a null pointer instead. Now, developers can annotate arguments to BPF
functions as being nullable, and the verifier enforces that they must be checked
before they can be dereferenced.
</p>

<p>
The BPF code has also been changed to allow more flexibility in where
<tt>struct_ops</tt> structures can be defined. Initially, only non-modular
kernel code could define the structures, Lee said. Recently, that restriction
has been relaxed, and now kernel modules can define their own
<tt>struct_ops</tt> types. He called out one of the kernel selftests — <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/bpf_testmod/bpf_testmod.c"><tt>bpf_testmod.c</tt></a>
— as a good
example of how that works.
</p>

<p>
Lee wrapped up by talking about mechanisms to support compatibility.
APIs and types evolve over time,
and BPF programs need to be able to cope with that. In the case of
<tt>struct_ops</tt>, two backward-compatible ways to make changes are to add new
operators, or to add arguments to existing operators.
Lee made the point that the verifier checks a program's behavior, but it does
not actually check the program's signature. So in the case of adding new
arguments to a function, old programs won't touch the new arguments, which is
valid behavior. In the case of adding new operators, things are slightly more
tricky. But as long as they are added to the end of the structure, everything
will still work out — the type in the kernel will have more fields than the
corresponding type in the BPF program, but
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/libbpf/libbpf_overview.html">
libbpf</a> zeroes out the entire
structure before loading. It also ignores trailing fields that are zeroed out in the
BPF program but absent in the kernel. So subsystems and modules are free to add
to <tt>struct_ops</tt> interfaces without requiring existing BPF programs to be rewritten.
</p>

<p>
One member of the audience asked whether there was any existing tooling to check
function signatures as opposed to behaviors. Lee replied that there was not.
</p>

<p>
That isn't the only way BPF supports backward-compatible interfaces, however;
another somewhat magical feature is names with suffixes. Specifically, if libbpf
sees a suffix attached to a type with three underscores, Lee explained, it
ignores everything after the underscores. This means that a BPF header could
define two structures <tt>player___v1</tt> and <tt>player___v2</tt>, and they would
both be mapped to <tt>player</tt> in the kernel. This lets a BPF program
implement multiple versions of the same interface, should that turn
out to be necessary.
</p>

<p>
A remote participant noted that all of this supported decoupling kernel versions
from BPF programs, but asked Lee whether there were any mechanisms to support
decoupling in the other direction, i.e. to let a BPF program not need to know
what module is loading it in order to call generic functions from that module.
Another member of the audience replied that there was no special functionality
to support uses like that, but that it may be achievable in practice. Different
kernel modules can define kfuncs with the same name and signature, so long as
only one is loaded at any given time. A BPF program that communicated only through such
kfuncs could potentially be used by multiple different kernel modules.
</p>

<p>
While these features are individually fairly small, they still represent an
increasing amount of attention being paid in the BPF space to forward and
backward compatibility. We will have to see whether this represents a change in
the position that BPF remains an unstable kernel-to-kernel interface.

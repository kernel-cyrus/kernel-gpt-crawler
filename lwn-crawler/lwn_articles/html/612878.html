           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 24, 2014</br>

Things happen quickly in the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) world.  LWN last
<a href="/Articles/606089/">looked at this work</a> in July, when
version&nbsp;2 of the patch set adding the <tt>bpf()</tt> system call had
been posted.  Two months later, this work is up to <a
href="/Articles/612764/">version&nbsp;14</a>; quite a bit has been changed
and some functionality has been removed in an attempt to make the patches
small enough for reviewers to cope with.  At this point, though, the core
system call may be reaching a point where it is getting close to ready for
entry into the mainline.  It seems like a good time for another look at
this significant addition to the kernel's functionality, with fervent hopes
that it doesn't change yet again.
<p>
BPF developer Alexei Starovoitov has certainly been energetic in his
efforts to get this work in condition for merging — the posting of twelve
versions in two months, many with significant changes, testifies to that.
He has been 
responsive to requests for changes, but, as <a
href="/Articles/612886/">this complaint</a> suggests, some developers have 
found him to be a little too pushy.  That has not stopped some of his
work from getting into the mainline, though, and, in the end, should not be a real
impediment to the eventual merging of the rest.
<p>
As with previous versions, the BPF functionality is accessed by way of a
single multiplexor system call, but that call has changed significantly:
<p>
<pre>
   #include &lt;linux/bpf.h&gt;

   int bpf(int cmd, union bpf_attr *attr, unsigned int size);
</pre>
<p>
The key change, made following <a href="/Articles/612882/">a suggestion from
Ingo Molnar</a>, is to create a single large union type holding all of the
possible parameter types for the various operations supported by
<tt>bpf()</tt>.  How that union is used depends on the specific command
given to the system call.
<p>
Most of the operations in the current patch set are concerned with the
management of maps — arrays of data that can be shared between a BPF
program and user space.  The process starts with the creation of a map,
done with the <tt>BPF_MAP_CREATE</tt> command.  With this command, the
system call expects the relevant information to be in this member of the
<tt>bpf_attr</tt> union:
<p>
<pre>
    struct { /* anonymous struct used by BPF_MAP_CREATE command */
	__u32             map_type;
	__u32             key_size;    /* size of key in bytes */
	__u32             value_size;  /* size of value in bytes */
	__u32             max_entries; /* max number of entries in a map */
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>map_type</tt> field describes the type of the map.  The plan is to
have a wide range of types, including hashed arrays, ordinary arrays,
bloom filters, and radix trees.  The current implementation claims to only
support the hash type, but even that implementation is missing from
the actual submission.  The <tt>key_size</tt> and <tt>value_size</tt>
parameters tell the code how large the keys and associated values will be,
while <tt>max_entries</tt> puts an upper bound on the number of items that
can be stored in a map.
<p>
When a call is made to <tt>bpf()</tt> to create a map, everything  in the
<tt>bpf_attr</tt> union beyond the
above structure must be set to zero, and
<tt>size</tt> should be the size of the union as a whole.  These rules,
which apply to all <tt>bpf()</tt> operations, are
enforced in the code; the purpose is to allow the addition of more
information to this union to support future enhancements to BPF
functionality.  If new fields are added, newer applications can provide
the needed information.  Older applications, instead, will have to pass
zeroes in those fields, so the right thing will happen.

<p>
Upon successful creation of a map, the return value from <tt>bpf()</tt>
will be an open file descriptor which can be used to refer to that map.
<p>
There is a set of commands to operate on individual entries in a map; they
all use this structure within the <tt>bpf_attr</tt> union:
<p>
<pre>
    struct { /* anonymous struct used by BPF_MAP_*_ELEM commands */
	__u32             map_fd;
	__aligned_u64     key;
	union {
	    __aligned_u64 value;
	    __aligned_u64 next_key;
	};
    };
</pre>
<p>
For all operations, <tt>map_fd</tt> is the file descriptor referring to the
map to be used, and <tt>key</tt> is a pointer to the key of interest.  To
store an item in the map, the <tt>BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM</tt> command should
be used; in this case, <tt>value</tt> should be a pointer to the data to be
stored.  To look up an item, use <tt>BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM</tt>; if the item
is present in the map, its value will be stored in the location pointed to
by <tt>value</tt>.  Items can be deleted with
<tt>BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM</tt>.  
<p>
Iterating through a map is done with <tt>BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY</tt>; it will
return the next key following the provided <tt>key</tt>.  The meaning of
"next" is dependent on the type of the map.  Should the given <tt>key</tt>
not be found in the map, <tt>next_key</tt> will be set to the first key in
the map, so a typical iteration is likely to be started by calling
<tt>BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY</tt> with a nonsense key.

<p>
Note that there is no command to delete a map.  Instead, the program that
created the map need only close the associated file descriptor; when all
descriptors are closed and no loaded BPF programs reference the map, it
will be deleted.
<p>
Loading a BPF program into the kernel is accomplished with the
<tt>BPF_PROG_LOAD</tt> command.  The relevant structure in this case is:
<p>
<pre>
    struct { /* anonymous struct used by BPF_PROG_LOAD command */
	__u32         prog_type;
	__u32         insn_cnt;
	__aligned_u64 insns;     /* 'const struct bpf_insn *' */
	__aligned_u64 license;   /* 'const char *' */
	__u32         log_level; /* verbosity level of eBPF verifier */
	__u32         log_size;  /* size of user buffer */
	__aligned_u64 log_buf;   /* user supplied 'char *' buffer */
    };
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>prog_type</tt> describes the context in which a program is
expected to be used; it controls which data and helper functions will be
available to the program when it runs.  <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET</tt> is
used for programs that will be attached to sockets, while
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING</tt> is for tracing filters.  The size of the
program (in instructions) is provided in <tt>insn_cnt</tt>, while
<tt>insns</tt> points to the program itself.  The <tt>license</tt> field
points to a description of the license for the program; it may be used in
the future to restrict some functionality to GPL-compatible programs.  
<p>
All programs must pass the BPF verifier as part of the loading process.  This verifier
is meant to ensure that the program cannot do harm to the system as a
whole.  It will prevent accesses to arbitrary data, disallow programs that
have loops, and more.  Should a developer want to know why the verifier is
rejecting a program, they can set up a logging buffer of length
<tt>log_size</tt>, pointed to by <tt>log_buf</tt>.  Actually turning on
logging is done by setting <tt>log_level</tt> to a non-zero value.
<p>
Note that the "fixup" array found in early versions of the patch set is no
longer present.  That array indicated the instructions referring to BPF map
file descriptors; said instructions were fixed to use internal pointers by
the verifier.  Current versions of the patch set, instead, define new
BPF instructions for map access.  The verifier can recognize those
instructions directly, so user space is no longer required to point them
out. 
<p>
In the v14 patch set, there is no way to actually attach BPF programs to
interesting events once they are loaded.  Such features are meant to be
added once the basic BPF functionality has gotten through review and found
its way into the mainline.  That point seems to be getting closer; the
developers who have taken an interest in the API seem to be increasingly
happy with what they have.  A 3.18 merge seems ambitious at this point, but
3.19 might be a real possibility.

<p>
hiding pointers like that is only going to make static analysis harder. (where do you put the __user attribute on the pointer target?) these should be union fields with a ptr and a __u64 field. this would also make the code more readable since no type casts (ptr_to_u64/u64_to_ptr seriously?) would be needed when reading/writing the pointer values.<br>

Its great to see a universal virtual machine find its way in the kernel, but the API seems strange, and ad hoc, especially if one considers that this may evolve into a major kernel entry point (wasn't one of the ideas for threadlets and async IO that they could be syscalls combined by code run by an in kernel virtual machine)  <br>

<p>
even using (predefined) ioctrl's on the bpf filediscriptor seems preferable to having a catch-all bpf sys call. <br>
<p>
However, the rest of entry points of the bpf call is related to maps. Why are maps so tightly coupled to  eBPF? If they are just attribute value pairs then what is the difference between a map and extended attributes? One would think that if a map is needed one can just use the xattr API  on a debugfs/  memfd/ special type of fd that is optimised for xattr's . And even if the maps have to be provided by the bpf system couldn't one use the xattr API for creating, reading, writing, deleting and  listing keys. That would greatly cut down on the number of bpf specific syscalls/ioctrl's/bpfcall entry points needed.<br>

<p>
Is the same map-fd usable with many different BPF programs?  If yes, it would be an efficient communication mechanism worth the trouble.<br>

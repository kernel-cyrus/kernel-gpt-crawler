           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 3, 2022</br>
           </div>
Persistent memory has a number of advantages; it is fast, CPU-addressable,
available in large quantities and, of course, persistent.  But it also,
arguably, poses a higher risk of suffering corruption as a result of bugs
in the kernel.  Protecting against this possibility is the objective of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220127175505.851391-1-ira.weiny@intel.com/">this
patch set</a> from Ira Weiny, which makes use of Intel's "protection keys
supervisor" (PKS) feature to make it harder for the kernel to inadvertently write
to persistent memory.
<p>
<h4>The stray-write problem</h4>
<p>
Data stored on rotating or solid-state drives can, normally, only be
overwritten with an explicit request issued by the CPU, a complex
operation that takes several steps to carry out.  Kernel bugs are
certainly capable of causing the wrong data to be written to a drive — or
the right data to end up in the wrong place — so kernel developers go out
of their way to prevent that from happening.  On the other hand, the kernel
is highly unlikely to accidentally trigger an erroneous write to a storage
device when the real objective was, say, to move a process into a new control
group or allocate a block of memory.  Things can always go wrong, but an
error that just happens to go through all of the steps of launching an I/O
operation is nearly impossible.
<p>
Persistent memory changes that situation.  A system can be equipped with
terabytes of this memory, all of which may contain important data, and all
of which is directly addressable by the CPU.  Now all that is required to
corrupt that memory is a single write to an incorrect pointer, which is a much
more probable sort of bug.  The corrupted data could lurk undetected
for years before, for example, some poor user discovers that their
cryptocurrency wallet has become inaccessible.  This kind of corruption
seems likely enough that it is worth making an effort to prevent,
regardless of how one feels about cryptocurrencies.
<p>
An obvious way to protect against this sort of bug would be to set the
protections on persistent memory to prevent kernel writes.  Those
protections would only be changed when the kernel actually needs to write
to persistent memory, and only for the duration of the operation.  The
normal permissions stored in the page tables could accomplish this task,
but at a huge performance cost.  Changing page-table permissions is
expensive; doing so for every persistent-memory write would take away much
of the performance gain that justified the use of persistent memory in the
first place.
<p>
There is another way, though, at least on Intel CPUs.  The "memory
protection keys" feature allows a four-bit key value to be associated with
each page-table entry; there is a per-thread mask that sets the read and
write permissions that currently apply to each key.  So, for example, that
mask might say that all pages marked with key&nbsp;3 are readable but not
writable by the current thread.  Changing the mask is not a privileged
operation, so protection keys are not a strict security feature, but they
can raise the bar for malicious access and prevent accidents.  Meanwhile,
changing the access mask is a fast operation that can change the
accessibility of large number of pages, so it is a far more efficient way
to provide this protection than tweaking page permissions.
<p>
<h4>Protecting persistent memory with PKS</h4>
<p>
Memory
protection keys can be used with any type of memory; one use case, for
example, is protecting cryptographic keys in ordinary memory.
Linux has supported <a href="/Articles/689395/">memory protection keys for
user space</a> since the 4.9 release in 2016.  But memory protection keys
can also be used for the kernel, with a kernel-specific key value
associated with each page; memory protection keys for the kernel is also
known as PKS.  Linux is not currently making use of 
this capability, though.  Thus, the first objective of Weiny's 44-part
patch set is to add support for PKS to the kernel, a task that involves a
number of little details.
<P>
For example, the access-control map for PKS is stored in a model-specific
register (MSR), which makes changes relatively fast.  That MSR is not
automatically saved by the CPU, though, when a thread is preempted, so the
kernel has to take care of that detail itself.  That involved some detailed
changes to the <tt>pt_regs</tt> structure so that it could hold the extra
information without breaking code that might not be expecting it.  The new
"auxiliary <tt>pt_regs</tt>" infrastructure can hold the PKS permission
mask, along with other information that will surely need to be stored in
the future.
<p>
There also needs to be a way to allocate the 16 available key values within
the kernel.  Of those, key&nbsp;0, which is the default key applied to all
pages, must retain the "all access allowed" permissions, so 15 keys remain
for other uses.  In the current implementation, these keys are
allocated statically in the code.  That
approach will have to change if the kernel runs out of keys, but it is not
clear that there will ever be enough users to get to that point.  Until
that happens, there is little value in adding a more sophisticated
key-allocation mechanism, so the static approach prevails.  In this patch
set, key&nbsp;1 is reserved for kernel self tests, and key&nbsp;2 is for
stray-write protection.
<p>
With that infrastructure in place, it's a relatively straightforward matter
to set up persistent-memory pages with the new key, and to set the access
permissions to deny writes.  That will prevent any stray writes from
corrupting the memory, which is good, but will also block legitimate
writes, which is not quite as good.  So the final step is to change the
permissions whenever the kernel needs to write to a persistent-memory page.
This is easily enough done in the drivers that deal directly with
persistent memory; the appropriate calls can just be inserted before and
after the writes are performed.  Once again, the change to the permissions
mask only applies to the current thread, so no other part of the kernel can
write to persistent memory while this operation is underway.
<p>
There is a remaining problem, though, in the form of the higher layers of
the kernel, which may also need to write to persistent memory.  One example
is the DAX code within filesystems that allows for the reading and writing
of data directly to persistent memory without the need to go through the
page cache.  Attempts to add the necessary calls around every location that
might write to persistent memory seem doomed to failure, so another
approach is required.
<p>
As it happens, kernel code is already required to make special calls before
accessing arbitrary pages of memory.  These calls, in the form of
<tt>kmap()</tt> and friends, currently do nothing on most 64-bit systems, but they
are needed on 32-bit systems where it is not possible to directly map all
of physical memory into the kernel's address space.  Weiny's patch set
causes the short-term calls (such as <tt>kmap_atomic()</tt> and
<tt>kmap_local_page()</tt>) to check whether the memory in question is
protected by the persistent-memory key.  If so, the permissions are changed
to allow persistent-memory writes for the duration of the mapping.
Long-term mappings (with plain <tt>kmap()</tt>) of protected persistent
memory are not allowed, so the window of opportunity to write to persistent
memory is kept small and is limited to the thread that needs it.
<p>
This patch set is in its eighth revision and has changed considerably since
<a href="/Articles/826554/">version&nbsp;2
was covered here</a> in mid 2020.  A number of core developers have had a
close look and made comments, resulting in a redesign of much of the
functionality.  Whether this version will pass muster remains to be seen,
but it should be getting closer.  The objective seems good; the CPU
provides a mechanism that can efficiently detect and prevent accidents, the
kernel should make use of it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Regarding stray writes corrupting regular disk storage, I believe a write to page cache might have similar repercussions. If a page is mapped read-only, it probably is not written back, but if it is read/write the kernel could corrupt it and the next write-back operation will persist the corruption on disk.<br>
<p>
It is still probably a bigger problem with persistent memory, though.<br>

Tangentially related, out of curiosity what are the userspace programs using pkey today?  I skimmed through the debian and github code search but only saw kernel source code hits and things that list system calls (e.g. systemd seccomp allowlist)<br>

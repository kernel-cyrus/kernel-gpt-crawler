           </div>
<p>
The sysfs and proc filesystems do not contain executables, setuid programs,
or device
nodes, but they are typically mounted with flags (i.e. <tt>noexec</tt>,
<tt>nosuid</tt>, and <tt>nodev</tt>) that disallow those types
of files anyway.  Currently, those flags are not enforced when those
filesystems are mounted inside of a namespace (i.e. the mount will succeed
without those flags being specified).  Furthermore, a sysfs or proc
filesystem that has been mounted read-only in the host can be mounted
read-write inside a namespace,
which is a bigger problem.
The others are subtle security
holes, or they could be, so Eric 
Biederman is trying to close them, though it turns out that the fixes break
some container
code.
</p>

<p>
In mid-May, Biederman <a href="/Articles/647755/">posted</a> a patch set
meant to address the problems, which boil down to differences in the
behavior of mounting these filesystems inside a container versus bind-mounting
them.  In the latter case, any restrictions the administrator has placed on
the original proc and sysfs mounts will be enforced on the bind mounts.
If, instead, those filesystems are directly mounted inside of a user
namespace, those restrictions won't be enforced.  The problem is largely
moot, at least for now, for executables, setuid programs, and device nodes,
but that is not so for the read-only case.  If the administrator of the
host has mounted <tt>/proc</tt> as read-only, a process running in a user
namespace could 
mount it read-write to evade that restriction, which is clearly a problem.
</p>

<p>
But Biederman was well aware that he might be breaking user-space
applications by making this change.  In particular, he was concerned about
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/">Sandstorm</a>, <a
href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC</a>, and <a
href="https://libvirt.org/drvlxc.html">libvirt LXC</a>, all of which employ
user namespaces.  So he put out the patches for testing (and comment).
</p>

<p>
That led to two reports of breakage, the <a
href="/Articles/647784/">first</a> from Serge Hallyn about a problem he
found using the patches with LXC.  The LXC user space was not passing the
three flags that restrict file types allowed for sysfs, which caused the
<tt>mount()</tt> call to fail with <tt>EPERM</tt> due to Biederman's
changes.  The <a href="/Articles/647789/">fix</a> for LXC is
straightforward but, as Andy Lutomirski <a href="/Articles/647790/">pointed
out</a>, Biederman's change is an ABI break for the kernel.  Given that
there aren't 
executables or device nodes on sysfs or proc, dropping enforcement of those
flags from the patch would not have any practical effect, Lutomirski argued.
</p>

<p>
Sandstorm lead Kenton Varda <a href="/Articles/647791/">suggested</a> that
instead of returning <tt>EPERM</tt>, <tt>mount()</tt> should instead ignore
the lack of those flags when the caller has no choice in the matter:
<div class="BigQuote">
 That is, in cases where
mount() currently fails with EPERM when not given, say, MS_NOSUID, it
should instead just pretend the caller actually set MS_NOSUID and go
ahead with a nosuid mount. Or put another way, the absence of
MS_NOSUID should not be interpreted as "remove the nosuid bit" but
rather "don't set the nosuid bit if not required".
</div>
</p>

<p>
As Varda noted, that would fix the problem without LXC needing to change
its code.  He also thought it would be less confusing than getting an
<tt>EPERM</tt> in that situation.  Neither Biederman nor Lutomirski liked
the implicit behavior that Varda suggested, however.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that libvirt LXC has a similar problem, as <a
href="/Articles/647796/">reported</a> by  Richard Weinberger.  It is
mounting <tt>/proc/sys</tt>, but not preserving the mount flags from
<tt>/proc</tt> in the host, thus the <tt>mount()</tt> was failing.  Once
again, there is a <a href="/Articles/647797/">simple fix</a>.
</p>

<p>
Lutomirski <a href="/Articles/647798/">suggested</a> removing the
<tt>noexec</tt>/<tt>nosuid</tt>/<tt>nodev</tt> part, but keeping the
read-only enforcement, to avoid the ABI break.  Biederman <a
href="/Articles/647801/">disagreed</a> with that approach.  It may not
matter <i>now</i> that proc and sysfs are mounted that way, but it has <a href="/Articles/191954/">mattered in
the past</a> and could again in the future:
<div class="BigQuote">
So I am leaning towards enforcing all of the mount flags including
nosuid, noexec, and nodev.  Then when the next subtle bug in proc or
sysfs with respect to chmod shows up I will be able to sleep soundly at
night because the mount flags of those filesystems allow a mitigation,
and I did not [sabotage] the mitigation.
<p>
Plus contemplating code that just enforces a couple of mount flags but
not all of [them] feels wrong.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He did want to avoid breaking LXC and libvirt LXC, though, at least until
those programs could be fixed and make their way out to users over the next
few years. So Biederman added a <a href="/Articles/647803/">patch</a> that
relaxed the requirement for <tt>noexec</tt> and <tt>nosuid</tt>
(<tt>nodev</tt> turns out to be a non-issue due to other kernel changes),
but printed a warning in the kernel log.  Since it is a security fix
(though not currently exploitable), he targeted the stable kernels with the
fix too.  However, Greg Kroah-Hartman <a href="/Articles/647805/">pointed
out</a> that adding warnings for things that have been working just fine is
not acceptable in stable kernels.
</p>

<p>
Though others disagree, Biederman does not see his changes as breaking the
ABI.  They do cause a behavior change and break two user-space programs
(at least that are known so far), however.  He would prefer not to break
those programs, so the warning is kind of a stop-gap measure, he <a
href="/Articles/647807/">argued</a>.  The changes are fixing security
holes, though, even if it appears they are not exploitable right now:
<div class="BigQuote">
Given that I have not audited sysfs and proc closely in recent years
   I may actually be wrong.  Those bugs may actually be exploitable.
   All it takes is chmod to be supported on one file that can be made
   executable.  That bug has existed in the past and I don't doubt
   someone will overlook something and we will see the bug again in the
   future.
</div>
</p>

<p>
As it stands, the changes will still allow current LXC and libvirt LXC
executables to function (though the version targeting the mainline will
warn about that kind of use).  Biederman plans to get it into linux-next,
presumably targeting 4.2.  After that, he plans to remove the warning and
enforce the mount options in a subsequent kernel release.  It is a bit hard
to argue that either of the two broken programs were actually doing what
their authors intended in the <tt>mount()</tt> calls, even though it
worked.  Assuming no other breakage appears, that might be enough to get
this patch added without triggering Linus Torvalds's "no regression" filter.

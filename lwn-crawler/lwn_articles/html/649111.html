<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>June 24, 2015</br>
           </div>
<p>
There has been a fair amount of <a href="/Articles/640357/">opposition to
kdbus</a>—an effort to move much of the D-Bus interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism into the kernel—that has <a href="/Articles/641275/">come up</a> since it was
first <a href="/Articles/619068/">posted</a> back in November&nbsp;2014.
Much of that criticism has been of the more or less unhinged variety, but
there have also been a number of technical complaints about the IPC scheme.
Two of the most persistent critics of the technical aspects of kdbus
recently made preemptive attacks of a sort against kdbus—neither of which
was particularly well-received by Greg Kroah-Hartman, who has been
coordinating the 
kdbus effort.

<p>In a post to 
the linux-kernel mailing list on June&nbsp;22,
Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/Articles/649112/">asked for</a> Linus Torvalds's
opinion on whether kdbus should be merged.  He made it clear that he is not asking
about timing (i.e. whether he will accept a—so far hypothetical—pull
request from Kroah-Hartman in this merge window), but: "<q>I mean whether you think that
kdbus should be merged if it had appropriate review and people were
okay with the implementation</q>".  He goes on to say that the
uncertainty about the future of kdbus makes it harder for those who might
be inclined to review the code (or to review it again, in his case) to
decide whether to do that review:
<div class="BigQuote">
 The kernel people who would review it (myself included)
probably don't want to review new versions at a line-by-line level,
because we (myself included) either don't know whether there's any
point or don't think that it should be merged *even if the
implementation were flawless*.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He continued by listing three main reasons that he felt kdbus should not be
merged.  First off, he doesn't believe that it is needed to solve the
problems that it 
claims to solve and that most of what needs to be done could be done in
user space.  He is also concerned that the buffering model used by kdbus
does not take control groups using a memory controller into account.
Lastly: "<q>The sandbox model is, in my opinion, an experiment that
isn't going 
to succeed.</q>"
</p>

<p>
As might be guessed, Kroah-Hartman was <a href="/Articles/649130/">less
than pleased</a> by Lutomirski's message, calling it a "<q>preemptive
pull request denial</q>".  He was clearly irritated that Lutomirski had
not had the courtesy to wait for his pull request—if he decided to
make one—before attacking kdbus.  But the technical complaints in the
message went unread, 
as Kroah-Hartman seized on an incorrect, but offhand, comment early in
Lutomirski's message to stop reading at that point.
</p>

<p>
Things took a different turn on June&nbsp;23 with a <a
href="/Articles/649133/">request</a> 
from Eric Biederman—another persistent kdbus critic—to remove the kdbus tree
from linux-next.  Biederman cited "<q>significant work that was identified last merge window
that has not yet been done, and who knows when it will be done</q>" as
the reason to remove it.  Furthermore:
<div class="BigQuote">
Having the kdbus tree in linux-next with the implicit suggestion that a
pull request will be sent to Linus this merge window before the problems
are addressed and we will have to repeat the mess from last merge window
keeps me up at night.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Once again, Kroah-Hartman was <a href="/Articles/649134/">unamused</a>:
"<q>No, that's not how this works.  That's not how any of this
works.</q>"  While Biederman claimed that the project was ignoring
feedback, Kroah-Hartman disagreed: "<q>We are not ignoring
_constructive_ feedback</q>".  There is "<q>no valid reason</q>"
to remove kdbus from linux-next, he concluded.
</p>

<p>
But Biederman was <a href="/Articles/649152/">not to be deterred</a>.  He
maintained that linux-next is for code that is destined for the next merge
window, which implies that kdbus will be offered up for merging soon (as
the 4.2 merge window is open), but that the code is not even remotely ready
for merging.  He suggested that lots of constructive feedback has simply
been ignored.  In the final analysis, he is trying to stop another pull
request for kdbus by having the code removed from linux-next—not a common
tactic, or even one that has been used at all before.
</p>

<p>
Part of the trigger for both Lutomirski and Biederman's posts seem to have
been the <a
href="http://0pointer.net/blog/the-new-sd-bus-api-of-systemd.html">announcement</a>
of the sd-bus API that relies on the existing kdbus implementation (though
it can fall back to using D-Bus), coupled
with the most recent <a
href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-June/033170.html">systemd
release</a> that depends on sd-bus.
In addition, one of the kdbus maintainers, David Herrmann, recently put out
a <a
href="https://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/from-af_unix-to-kdbus/">blog
post</a> that describes kdbus in terms of the <tt>AF_UNIX</tt> sockets that
are familiar to many developers.  That may have been seen as a prelude to
another pull request for kdbus.

Beyond that, the systemd release announcement
encourages distributions to add kdbus to their kernels and to use it with
systemd/sd-bus.  <i>That</i> will simply <a href="/Articles/649154/">lead
to problems</a> down the road, Lutomirski said:
<div class="BigQuote">
FWIW, once there are real distros with kdbus userspace enabled,
reviewing kdbus gets more complicated -- we'll be in the position
where merging kdbus in a different form from that which was proposed
will break existing users.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But it is not uncommon for user-space code to be written to try out new
kernel features, sometimes long before they get merged.  It is a way to
shake out problems with the new feature and to prove that it is useful.  On
the flip side, though, getting a feature into a distribution is a subtle (or
not-so-subtle) way to apply pressure for the feature to be merged.  Over
the years, there
have been a number of examples of features that were released in
distributions and were merged into the kernel over fairly strenuous
objections because of their widespread availability.  Some Android features
(e.g. binder) likely fall into that category, but things like AppArmor also
probably qualify.
</p>

<p>
It is against that backdrop that Lutomirski and Biederman are making their
moves.  But, of course, Torvalds will have the final say and it turns out
that he is <a href="/Articles/649157/">inclined to merge kdbus</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
So I am still expecting to merge it, mainly for a rather simple
reason: I trust my submaintainers, and Greg in particular. So when a
major submaintainer wants to merge something, that pulls a *lot* of
weight with me.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Though it is clear that one of the arguments made by kdbus proponents
doesn't hold any water with him: performance.  The <a
href="/Articles/640360/">pull 
request</a> Kroah-Hartman made for the 4.1 kernel ran into some serious
questions about the performance gains claimed, with Torvalds himself <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1930358/focus=1939166">expressing</a>
a fair amount of skepticism that speeding up D-Bus required a move into the
kernel:
<div class="BigQuote">
If somebody wants to speed up dbus, they should likely look at the
user-space code, not the kernel side.
<p>
My guess is that pretty much the entirely of the quoted kdbus
"speedup" isn't because it speeds up any kernel side thing, it's
because it avoids the user-space crap in the dbus server.
<p>
IOW, all the people who say that it's about avoiding context switches
are probably just full of shit. It's not about context switches, it's
about bad user-level code.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He hasn't changed his mind at all ("<q>I am not AT ALL
impressed by the performance argument</q>"), but still is likely to
merge kdbus at some point.  Given that there have been no new postings of
kdbus since the pull request from the last merge window, it would seem a
little late to be asking for a new version to be pulled in for 4.2.  And
Kroah-Hartman has not done so; there may be work going on to address some
of the outstanding comments and questions (perhaps including the
performance question) so that kdbus won't be offered up for merging again
until the next development cycle.
</p>

<p>
One of the key aspects of the dispute concerns the addressing of review
comments. 
Lutomirski, Biederman, and others believe that there have been substantive
constructive comments that have simply been ignored—though, with no new code
posted, that may well be a premature conclusion.  But "constructive", it seems,
is in the eye of the beholder, so the kdbus developers may also feel that
they have addressed those comments by disagreeing with them—and explaining
why.  It would seem to be a classic standoff situation that requires a
final arbiter to make a determination.  Torvalds is that arbiter, of
course, and he seems to have decided—now it appears to just be a question of
when, not 
if, kdbus is merged.

<p>
This is somewhere between misleading and plain wrong. sd-bus doesn't "rely" on kdbus, it supports both kdbus and dbus1, and has been supporting both since a long time. Also, systemd hasn't started to depend on sd-bus just recently. It has been using it exclusively instead of libdbus since v209, which we released beginning of 2014. And that's only when we completed porting from libdbus to sd-bus. Some of the systemd code had been using it for much much longer.<br>

<p>
This is also misleading. We are just asking downstream users to add it to their *development* distros, to collect bug reports. We are not asking anyone to ship anything in stable distros.<br>

The library is not portable to non-Linux, and that's on purpose: we want to keep it minimal, without abstracting the low-level bits, while making the best of the Linux platform.<br>
<p>
The library is relatively small because it makes use of the large set of utility calls we have in systemd internally (like the stuff you find in src/basic/ in the systemd tree). That means that splitting the library out would mean forking that toolset too, but we have no interest in that, we only want to maintain one version of it.<br>
<p>
I actually prefer if my software stays free software, thus I much prefer LGPL over a BSD license. Also, we are very interested in still being able to copy and move sources around within our source tree, and applying different licenses to our components makes that hard.<br>
<p>
So to make this clear: the library will not be portable to non-Linux, the library will stay part of systemd and the library will stay LGPL.<br>
<p>
Sorry if that's disappointing.<br>

Ah, that's a shame. The API looks nice. DBus or something like it, is definitely I need to investigate at some point for something. I was also scared by libdbus - it's quite sprawling. sd-bus looks much more reasonable. However, I won't be allowed to use it if it's confined to Linux, or I'd have to maintain a fork.<br>
<p>
Another option is to look at OpenWRTs ubus, I guess.<br>
<p>
I never said anything about licences. The code I'm interested in using DBus with is GPLv2 - it needs to remain portable to and /run/ on BSD, not be BSD licensed. ;)<br>

I would have liked it because the current state makes it annoying to even try sd-bus on Fedora 22.  If I build and install a new libsystemd, I bet I'll break my system pretty badly.<br>

The thread in the article just confirms what I had already expected hence the lesson to be learned here is that individuals from the kernel community *will* as has been proven ( with that thread ), resort to gorilla warfare tactics ( on top of the questionable means of communication and respect for other developers work and each other ) to prevent things being merged into the kernel they oppose based on their political point of view and their own "feelings" towards the individual(s) submitting or otherwise have contribute to the code requested to be merged.<br>

There are neither gorillas nor guerillas involved here, nor do I actually have a political or moral objection to kdbus.  I could have waited to voice my opinion until the next pull request, patch series, or whatever, but that would IMO just waste everyone's time in comparison to asking the question now.  So I asked.<br>
<p>
I don't want to review the code carefully if there's no point in doing so.  If, on the other hand, there is a reason to review it carefully, then I'll try to do so.<br>

If that was the intent was to simply ask that question then the first two paragraph from you in that thread would have sufficed however you chose to take it one step further...<br>
<p>
Will it be done right in the start? nope not like many other things that are in the kernel so in the end it's either going to be rewritten once or more for the shortcomings that will be discovered later on or it will be replaced altogether with a better solution, <br>
<p>
You and the rest of those "we" you refer to already have had the guys spending their time rewriting this to your every whim for that past two years ( then you speak of not wasting everyone's time o_O ) so really is not all this time better spent actually review the code itself rather then spending all that time and energy debating it's existence or reason for being or whom submitted it? <br>
<p>
In the end of the day Ingo is right that the merge process should be stripped of politics and emotion as much as possible ( which seems to me is not the case here ). Then there is the fact that this code comes at a zero cost to the core kernel and will evolve and have a life cycle of it's own in the long run once it is merged so it might be replaced by yours and those "we" superior solution if and when it will emerge or it will evolve closer to your preference or closer to it's original design or even into something entirely different or it simply might be taken out of it's misery and people learn adapt and move on, just like has been with any other bits and pieces that have been merged into the kernel since it's beginning since the only constant in this world is change.<br>

I seriously considered doing that and then replying to myself with the rest.  It seemed silly.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Then there is the fact that this code comes at a zero cost to the core kernel</font><br>
<p>
Nope.  The code does interesting things with memcgs (inadvertently) and has really nasty interactions with capabilities.  It exposes things to other processes that simply should not be exposed.  That means that if we change core security constructs, suddenly the scope for security regressions expands from the intended surface within the kernel to whatever daft thing user programs that we've never seen do with, say, cap_bset.<br>

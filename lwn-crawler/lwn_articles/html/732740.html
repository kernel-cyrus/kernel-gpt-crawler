The kernel's CPU-frequency ("cpufreq") governors are charged with picking
an operating frequency for each processor that minimizes power use while
maintaining an adequate level of performance as determined by the current
policy.  These governors normally run locally, with each CPU handling its
own frequency management.  The 4.14 kernel release, though, will enable the
CPU-frequency governors to control the frequency of any CPU in the
system if the architecture permits, a change that should improve the
performance of the system overall.

<p>For a long time, the cpufreq governors used the kernel's timer
infrastructure to run at a regular interval and sample CPU utilization.
That approach had its shortcomings; the biggest one was that the
cpufreq governors were running in a reactive mode, choosing the next
frequency based on the load pattern in the previous sampling period.  There
is, of course, no guarantee that the same load pattern will continue after
the frequency is changed. Additionally, there was no coordination between
the cpufreq governors and the task scheduler.  It would be far better if
the cpufreq 
governors were proactive and, working with the scheduler, could choose a
frequency that suits the load that the system is going to have in the next
sampling period.</p>

<p>In the 4.6 development cycle, Rafael Wysocki removed the dependency on kernel
timers and placed hooks within the scheduler itself. The scheduler  calls these
hooks for certain events, such as attaching  a task to a
run queue or when the load created by the processes in run queue
changes. The hooks are implemented by the individual cpufreq governors.
Those governors register and unregister their CPU-utilization
update callbacks with the scheduler using the following 
interfaces:</p>
<p>
<pre>
    void cpufreq_add_update_util_hook(int cpu, struct update_util_data *data,
                        	      void (*func)(struct update_util_data *data, 
						   u64 time, unsigned int flags));
    void cpufreq_remove_update_util_hook(int cpu);
</pre>

<p>Where <tt>struct update_util_data</tt> is defined as:
<p>
<pre>
    struct update_util_data {
	void (*func)(struct update_util_data *data, u64 time, unsigned int flags);
    };
</pre>

<p>The scheduler internally keeps per-CPU pointers to the <tt>struct
update_util_data</tt> which is passed to the
<tt>cpufreq_add_update_util_hook()</tt> routine. Only one callback can be
registered per CPU. The scheduler starts calling the
<tt>cpufreq_update_util_data-&gt;func()</tt> callback from the next
event that happens after the callback is registered.

<p>The legacy governors (ondemand and conservative) are still considered to be
reactive, as they continue to rely on the data available from the last
sampling period to compute the next frequency to run. Specifically, they
calculate CPU load based on how much time a CPU was idle in the last
sampling period. However, the <a href="/Articles/682391/">schedutil
governor</a> is considered to be proactive, since
it calculates the next frequency based on the average utilization of the
CPU's current 
run queue. The schedutil governor will pick the maximum frequency for a CPU
if any realtime or deadline tasks are available to run.</p>

<h4>Remote callbacks</h4>

<p>In current kernels, the scheduler will call these utilization-update
hooks only if the target run queue, the queue for the CPU whose utilization
has changed, is
the run queue of the local CPU. While this works well for most 
scheduler events, it doesn't work that well for some. This mostly
affects performance of only the schedutil cpufreq governor, since the others
don't take the average utilization into consideration
when calculating the next frequency.</p>

<p> With certain types of systems, such as Android, the latency of cpufreq
response to certain scheduling events can be critical. As the cpufreq
callbacks aren't called from remote CPUs currently, it means there are
certain situations where a target CPU may not run the cpufreq governor for
some time.

<p>For example, consider a system where a task is running on a given
CPU, and a second task is queued to run on that CPU by a different CPU. If the
newly enqueued task has a high CPU demand, the target CPU should
increase its frequency immediately (based on the utilization average of
its run queue) to meet that demand.  But, because of the above-mentioned limitation,
this does not occur as the task was enqueued by a remote CPU. The schedutil
cpufreq governor's utilization update hook will be called only on
the next scheduler event, which may happen only after some microseconds
have passed.
That is bad for
performance-critical tasks like the Android user interface. Most Android devices
refresh the screen at 60 frames per second; that is 16ms
per frame. The screen rendering has to finish within these 16ms to
avoid jerky motion. If 4ms are taken by the cpufreq
governor to update the frequency, then the user's experience isn't
going to be nice.</p>

<p> This problem can be avoided by invoking the governor to change the
target CPU's frequency immediately after queuing the new task, but that may
not always be possible or practical; the processor architecture may not
allow it. For example, the x86 architecture updates CPU frequencies by
writing to local, per-CPU registers, which remote CPUs cannot do. Sending
an inter-processor interrupt to the target CPU to update its frequency
sounds like overkill and will add unnecessary noise for the scheduler.
Using interrupts could add just the sort of latency that this work seeks to
avoid.  <p>

On the other hand, updating CPU frequencies on the ARM architecture is
normally CPU-independent; any CPU can change the frequency of any other
CPU.  Thus, the <a
href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=150122447311329&amp;w=2">patch
set</a>
enabling remote callbacks took the middle approach and avoided sending
inter-processor interrupts to the target CPU. The patch set is
queued in the 
power-management 
tree for the 4.14-rc1 kernel release. The frequency of a CPU can now be
changed remotely by a CPU that shares cpufreq policy with the target CPU;
that is, both the CPUs share their clock and voltage rails and switch
performance state together.  But CPU-frequency changes can also be made from any
other CPU on the system if the cpufreq policy of the target CPU has the
<tt>policy-&gt;dvfs_possible_from_any_cpu</tt> field set to
true. This is a new field and must be set by the cpufreq driver
from its <tt>cpufreq_driver-&gt;init()</tt> callback if it allows changing
frequencies from CPUs running a different cpufreq policy.  The generic
device-tree based 
cpufreq driver is already updated to enable remote changes.

<p>Remote cpufreq callbacks will be enabled (by default) in the 4.14
kernel release; they should improve the performance of the schedutil
governor in a number of scenarios. Other architectures may want to consider
updating their cpufreq drivers to set
<tt>policy-&gt;dvfs_possible_from_any_cpu</tt> field to true if they can
support cross-CPU frequency changes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

From the point of view of a newbie like me, it would be interesting to know which other architectures, besides ARM, allow this (if any!).<br>

You could find ARM systems that do not implement it, too. And even though you may have 8 potential clock inputs in the design, you might supply them all with the same source clock giving you a granularity of "I can set the frequency of 7 other CPUs, but have to consider myself".<br>
<p>
Mostly it's a question of power intent and complexity in system design, more than it ever is capability of an architecture or microarchitecture. Whoever is designing the clock, reset and power controllers is the person to ask ;)<br>

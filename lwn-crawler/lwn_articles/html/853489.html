The kernel's <a href="/Articles/740157/">BPF virtual machine</a> is versatile;
it is possible to load BPF programs into the kernel to carry out
a large (and growing) set of tasks.  The growing body of BPF code can
reasonably be
thought of as kernel code in its own right.  But, while the kernel can
check signatures on loadable modules and prevent the loading of modules
that are not properly signed, there is no such mechanism for BPF programs;
any sufficiently privileged process can load any program that will pass the
verifier.  One might think that adding this checking for BPF would be
straightforward, but that subsystem has some unique characteristics that
make things more challenging than one might expect.  There may be a
solution in the works, though; fittingly, it works by loading yet another BPF
program.
<p>
Loadable kernel modules are stored as executable images in the ELF format.
When one is loaded, the kernel parses that format and does the work needed
to enable the module to run within the kernel; this work includes
allocating memory for variables, performing relocations, resolving symbols,
and more.  All of the necessary information exists within the ELF file.
Applying a signature to that file is simply a matter of checksumming the
relevant sections and signing the result.
<p>
BPF programs have similar needs, but the organization of the requisite
information is a bit more, for lack of a better word, messy.  The code
itself is compiled as an executable section that is then linked into a
loader program that runs in user space and invokes the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt></a>
system call to load the BPF program into memory.

But BPF programs, too, need to have data areas allocated in the form of BPF
maps, and they need relocations (of a sort) applied to be able to cope with
different structure layouts on different systems.  The necessary maps are
"declared" as special ELF sections in the loader program; the <a
href="https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf">libbpf</a> library finds those
sections and turns them into more <tt>bpf()</tt> calls.  The BPF program
itself is then modified (before loading into the kernel) so that it can
find its maps when it runs.
<p>
This structure poses a challenge for anybody wanting to implement signed
BPF programs.  The maps are a part of the program itself; if they are not
established as intended, a BPF program might misbehave in interesting
ways.  But the kernel has no way to enforce any specific map
configuration, and thus cannot ensure that a signed BPF program has been
properly set up.  Additionally, the need to modify the BPF program itself
will break 
signature verification; after all, modifications to BPF programs are just
the sort of thing this mechanism is expected to prevent.  So, somehow, the
kernel has to take a more active role in the loading of BPF programs.
<p>
<h4>In-kernel BPF loading</h4>
<p>
The old-timers among us will remember that, once upon a time, the kernel's
module loader 
lived in user space.  Moving it into the kernel was one of many causes of
extended pain during the 2.5 development cycle; 20&nbsp;years later, some
developers still hold a grudge against Rusty Russell for that experience.  But
those problems are long past and the in-kernel loader has long since ceased
to create problems.  So one might logically expect that moving the
user-space BPF loader into the kernel would be a sensible approach to take.
<p>
According to Alexei Starovoitov in <a
href="/ml/bpf/20210417033224.8063-1-alexei.starovoitov@gmail.com/">the
cover letter</a> to a new patch set, that approach has been tried in a
couple of forms and "<q>discarded after months of work</q>".
Evidently an attempt was made to move libbpf into the kernel; it is not
entirely surprising that this complex body of code did not fit comfortably
there.  Another idea was to create a new executable file format that
contained, in essence, a series of system calls needed to set up a specific
BPF program.
<p>
The problems that were encountered while implementing that second approach
are not spelled out.  But the third approach, found in Starovoitov's patch
set, can be thought of as a variant on that idea.  Rather than have the
kernel step through a series of system calls, though, user space loads a
special BPF program that does that work instead.
<p>
Specifically, the patch set creates yet another type of BPF program — one
that exists to execute system calls.  This program will run in the context
of the process that runs it, and will be limited to a small set of system
calls; only <tt>bpf()</tt> and <tt>close()</tt> are allowed in the proposed
patch set.  This program will be expected to make the necessary set of
<tt>bpf()</tt> calls to load and set up the BPF program that the user
really wants to run.
<p>
The generation of this "loader program" is done by  watching what libbpf
does to load the BPF program of interest and capturing each of the
resulting <tt>bpf()</tt> calls.  Those calls are then collected to generate
the loader program, which will reproduce that work, from within the kernel,
at the right time.  So 
the kernel is, indeed, stepping through a canned series of system calls to
load the program; it's just that this series is formatted as a BPF program
in its own right.
<p>
The problem of patching the BPF program to find its maps is addressed in
the usual way: adding another layer of indirection.  An array of file
descriptors is set up, and the BPF program references maps by way of that
array.  When the program is loaded, this array can be populated with the
actual file descriptors corresponding to the necessary maps.
<p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>
As Starovoitov noted in the cover letter, this work is not yet a complete
solution to the problem; it is a first step to show the direction that this
work is taking.  A big remaining piece is the offset relocations needed for
BPF programs to access structure fields in a configuration-independent
way.  These relocations, too, require changing the BPF program text, so the
solution may not be entirely trivial; more indirection-based schemes run
the risk of imposing more of a performance cost than some users may want to
pay.
<p>
There is also, of course, the little matter of signing BPF programs and
checking those signatures; this problem is not addressed in this patch set
either.  There is a brief mention of putting together a skeleton that would
allow BPF programs to be packaged into a kernel module; if that were done,
then the existing system for checking module signatures could be used for
BPF programs as well.
<p>
At a first glance, the BPF loader looks like a bit of a convoluted solution
to the problem.  It is worth noting, though, that this mechanism is not all
that far removed from what happens in user space, where running a program
usually involves launching <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html"><tt>ld.so</tt></a>
to assemble the required pieces for that program to run.  So there are
well-established precedents to this sort of solution.  Whether this design
will make it into the mainline kernel is yet to be seen, though; this work
is young and has not yet seen much review.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I&#x27;m struggling to understand the use case for this.<br>
<p>
I view BPF programs as effectively use-space programs that rely on a different mechanism for privilege separation (in that case the BPF VM instead of the CPU&#x27;s MMU) for performance reasons. You could design the kernel in such a manner that everything BPF does could also be done in userspace (and the vast majority of it actually could), albeit with a lot of performance penalties that make some things intractable.<br>
<p>
From that perspective: what&#x27;s the threat model that these signatures try to fend off? If you really want to make sure that only signed code is running, why couldn&#x27;t that also be accomplished by requiring signatures on the user-space programs that set up the BPF programs? Then you&#x27;d have implicitly signed the BPF programs themselves. And if you don&#x27;t want to require signatures on all user-space programs, but don&#x27;t trust the BPF verifier, you should disable BPF entirely and just put your specialized functionality into a custom kernel module that can be signed.<br>
<p>
But even if you wanted to sign BPF programs: the current solution appears to be overly complicated. Why not compile them into kernel modules (that already can be signed) that create and register the programs, and allow userspace to select a program from the list of registered signed BPF programs?<br>

+1 to this.<br>
<p>
You could, for instance, have a version of `bpftool` that checks signatures on the BPF-program elves, and in turn is signed itself, and then (if you want the kernel to enforce the signature requirement) the kernel checks the signature on `bpftool` before accepting its bpf() calls.<br>
<p>
eBPF has gone down a road of over-abstraction, over-indirection and over-complexification in the last couple of years.  I wish I&#x27;d pushed back more, but I&#x27;ve been too busy with other things to argue with each piece on the ML.  The fact that putting the BPF loader into the kernel proved too difficult is not an argument for BPF_PROG_TYPE_SYSCALL; rather, it&#x27;s an indictment of the BPF loader.<br>

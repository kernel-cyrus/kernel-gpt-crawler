<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2014/">2014 LSFMM Summit</a>
</div>
<p>
Al Viro gave an update on the long-awaited <tt>revoke()</tt> system call to
the 2014 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management (LSFMM) Summit. <tt>revoke()</tt> is meant to <tt>close()</tt> any existing file
descriptors open for a given pathname so that a process can know that it
has exclusive use of the file or device in question.
Viro also discussed some work he has been doing to unify the multiple variants
of the <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> system calls.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/592787/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/lsfmm-viro-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Al Viro]" height=200 width=190>
</a>

<p>
Viro started out by saying that <tt>revoke()</tt> was the less interesting
part of his session.  It is getting "more or less close to done", he said.
 We <a
href="/Articles/546537/">looked</a> at an earlier version of this work a
year ago.
Files will be able to be declared revokable at <tt>open()</tt> time.  If
they are, a counter will track the usage of the <tt>file_operations</tt>
functions 
at any given time.  Once <tt>revoke()</tt> is called, it waits for all
currently active threads to exit the <tt>file_operations</tt>, and makes
sure that no more are allowed to start.
</p>

<p>
There are places in procfs and sysfs where something similar is open-coded,
Viro said, that could be removed once the <tt>revoke()</tt> changes go in.
One of the keys is to ensure that the common path does not slow down for
<tt>revoke()</tt> since most files will not be revokable.  There are
several areas that still need work, including <tt>poll()</tt>, which
"provides some complications", and <tt>mmap()</tt>, which has always been
problematic for <tt>revoke()</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
In a bit of an aside, Viro noted that there is a lot of code that is "just
plain broke".  For example, if a file 
in debugfs is opened and the underlying code removes the file from the debugfs
directory, any read or write operation using the open file descriptor will
oops the kernel.  Dynamic 
debugfs is completely broken, Viro said.  He hopes that the
<tt>revoke()</tt> code will be in reasonable shape in a couple of
cycles—"it's getting there".  Dynamic debugfs will be one of the first
users, he said.
</p>

<p>
Viro then moved on to the unification of plain <tt>read()</tt> and
<tt>write()</tt> with the <tt>readv()</tt>/<tt>writev()</tt> variants as
well as <tt>splice_read()</tt> and <tt>splice_write()</tt>.  The regular
and vector variants (<tt>readv()</tt>/<tt>writev()</tt>) have mostly been
combined, he said.  It is "not pretty", but it is tolerable.  The splice
variants got "really messy".  

<p>
Ideally, the code for all of the variants
should look the same all the way down, until you get to the final
disposition.  But each of the variants has its own view of the data; the
splice variants get/put their data into pages, which doesn't fit well with
the <tt>iovec</tt> used by the other two variants (in most implementations,
plain 
<tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> are translated to an <tt>iovec</tt> of
length one).  Creating a new data structure that can hold both user and
kernel <tt>iovec</tt> members, along with <tt>struct page</tt> for the
splice variants may be the way to go, Viro said.
</p>

<p>
Something that "fell out" of his work in this area is the addition of
<tt>iov_iter</tt>.  The <tt>iov_shorten()</tt> operation tries to
recalculate the number of network segments that fall into a given
<tt>iovec</tt> area, but the result is that the <tt>iovec</tt> gets
modified when there are short reads or writes.  Worse still, how the
<tt>iovec</tt> gets modified is protocol-dependent, which makes it hard for
users.  In fact, someone from the CIFS team said that it makes a copy of
any <tt>iovec</tt> before passing it in because it doesn't know what it
will get back.
</p>

<p>
Having it be protocol-dependent is "just wrong", Viro said.  He has been
getting rid of <tt>iov_shorten()</tt> calls, as well as other places that
shorten <tt>iovec</tt> arrays.  That might allow <tt>sendpage()</tt> to be
removed entirely; protocols that want to be smart can set up an
<tt>iov_iter</tt>, he said.

I often see photos of individual people in lwn articles.  If it's not too much work, please consider putting the name of these people with the pictures.  It could be a hover (probably not great for mobile devices), or a caption, or anything like that.<br>
<p>
It's often possible, as in the case of this article, to accurately guess the  name of the person, based on the title and/or content.  But much of the time it is not.<br>
<p>
Thank you for your consideration, and thanks for all of these awesome articles!<br>

      There are one additional thing one can do (besides hover): actual honest to goodness left click. In this particular case this will show large picture with acompanying text “Al Viro at 2014 LSFMM Summit” which means that detective skills are not really needed.

While that does the trick, it is not particularly user friendly. I would prefer to not have to navigate away from where I am in the text to learn the name of someone in a picture. As soon as I navigate away the natural flow of reading gets interrupted. <br>
<p>
Also, as I generally browse LWN though a mobile device I would also like to not have to eat from my data allowance by loading a large image, when I really just want to have some information that could easily have fit in a small caption. <br>

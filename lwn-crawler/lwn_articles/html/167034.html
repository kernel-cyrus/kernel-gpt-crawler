The mutex code may well have set a record for the shortest time spent in
-mm for such a fundamental patch.  It would not have been surprising for
mutexes to sit in -mm through at least one kernel cycle, which would
have had them being merged in or after 2.6.17.  But the mutex code appeared in exactly
one -mm release (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/166762/">2.6.15-mm2</a>,
released on January&nbsp;7) before being merged into the mainline on
January&nbsp;9.
<p>
The actual mutex type (minus debugging fields) is quite simple:
<p>
<pre>
    struct mutex {
	atomic_t		count;
	spinlock_t		wait_lock;
	struct list_head	wait_list;
    };
</pre>
<p>
Unlike semaphores, mutexes have one definition which is used on all
architectures.  Some of the actual locking and unlocking code can be
overridden if it can be made to perform better on a specific architecture,
but the core data structure remains the same.  The <tt>count</tt> field
contains the state of the mutex.  A value of one indicates that it is
available, zero means locked, and a negative value means that it is locked
and processes might be waiting.  Separating the two "locked" cases is
worthwhile: in the (usual) case where nobody is waiting for the mutex,
there is no need to go through the process of seeing if anybody needs to be
waked up.  <tt>wait_lock</tt> controls access to <tt>wait_list</tt>, which
is a simple list of processes waiting on the mutex.
<p>

The mutex API (obtained through <tt>&lt;linux/mutex.h&gt;</tt>) is simple.
Every mutex must first be initialized either at 
declaration time with:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_MUTEX(name);
</pre>
<p>
Or at run time with:
<p>
<pre>
    mutex_init(struct mutex *lock);
</pre>
<p>

Once a mutex has been initialized, it can be locked with any of:
<p>
<pre>
    void mutex_lock(struct mutex *lock);
    int mutex_lock_interruptible(struct mutex *lock);
    int mutex_trylock(struct mutex *lock);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>mutex_lock()</tt> will lock the mutex, putting the calling
process into an uninterruptible wait if need be.
<tt>mutex_lock_interruptible()</tt> uses an interruptible sleep; if the
lock is obtained, it will return zero.  A return value of <tt>-EINTR</tt>
means that the locking attempt was interrupted by a signal and the caller
should act accordingly.  Finally, <tt>mutex_trylock()</tt> will attempt to
obtain the lock, but will not sleep; unlike
<tt>mutex_lock_interruptible()</tt>, it returns zero on failure (the lock
was unavailable) and one if the lock is acquired.
<p>
In all cases, the mutex must eventually be freed (by the same process which
acquired it) through a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    void mutex_unlock(struct mutex *lock);
</pre>
<p>
Note that <tt>mutex_unlock()</tt> cannot be called from interrupt context.
This restriction appears to have more to do with keeping mutexes from ever
being used as completions than a fundamental restriction caused by the
mutex design itself.  Note also that a mutex can only be locked once -
locking calls do not nest.
<p>
Finally, there is a function for querying the state of a mutex:
<p>
<pre>
    int mutex_is_locked(struct mutex *lock);
</pre>
<p>
This function will return a boolean value indicating whether the mutex is
locked or not, but will not change the state of the lock.
<p>

Now that this code has been merged, the <tt>semaphore</tt> type can
officially be considered to be on its way out.  New code should not use
semaphores, and old code which uses semaphores as mutexes should be
converted over when an opportunity presents itself.  The reader/writer
semaphore type (rwsem) is a different beast, and is not affected by this
patch.  There is a debugging option which can be configured into
development kernels which may help with the transition; with this option
enabled, quite a few types of errors will be detected.
<p>
At this point, code which uses the counting feature of semaphores lacks a
migration path.  There is evidently a plan to introduce a new,
architecture-independent type for these users, but that code has not yet
put in an appearance.  Once that step has been taken, the path will be
clear for the eventual removal of semaphores from the kernel entirely.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

If you could it would not be a mutex but a semaphore! A mutex can only be
unlocked by the owner - which must be a task. But when you turn off the debug code, Ingo's mutex is indeed just a binary semaphore. <p>

At computer science we were indeed told to use binary semaphores as mutual exclusion locks. But it is a bad advice. The semantics is very different. To help debugging and make the code more understandable it is really a good idea to use seperate types for completion type semaphores and mutex and to enforce the mutex semantics. On real-time systems you must use a mutex with some kind of priority inversion prevention (priority inheritance or priority ceiling). Therefore it is essential not to mix up mutex with completions on that kind of systems.<p>

Furthermore: When a mutex can't be touched from interrupts, you don't have
to disable interrupts while performing mutex operations.

Quite a bit of work has been done in recent years to allow the kernel to
make more use of large folios.  That progress has not yet reached the
handling of text (executable code) areas, though.  During the
memory-management track of the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF Summit, Ryan Roberts ran a session on how that
situation might be improved.  It would be a relatively small and contained
operation, but can give a measurable performance improvement.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/1016423/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/lsfmm/RyanRoberts-sm.png" alt="[Ryan Roberts]"
title="Ryan Roberts" class="rthumb"></a>

Roberts began by saying that his objective is to make a kernel built for a 4KB
page size to perform as well as one built for 64KB pages, at least when it
comes to the handling of text.  By mapping larger folios by default, he
said, the kernel could take advantage of translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
coalescing on newer processors and reduce memory-management overhead.  The
kernel's ability to use large folios has improved considerably; both
anonymous memory and the page cache can work with them now.
<p>
Text pages are managed through the page cache too, but the way they are
accessed tends to prevent the use of large folios.  When a file is being
read from user space, the kernel's readahead system will detect sequential
access and allocate large folios as data is read into the page cache.
Execution tends not to be sequential, though; instead, it bounces randomly
around the text section.  As a result, sequential access is not detected,
and the kernel, seeing random access, sticks with smaller folios.  But,
Roberts said, large (64KB) folios could be used for text without
significantly increasing memory consumption.
<p>
David Hildenbrand said that various people have tried using larger folios
for text, but have not gotten as much of a performance improvement as had
been expected.  He wondered what sort of improvement Roberts expected from
this kind of change.  Roberts answered that he would get to the results,
but that the short answer was that it depends on the workload, with some
workloads seeing big improvements.

<p>
For file readahead, Roberts continued, the kernel will bring in some data
synchronously, then speculatively start an asynchronous read further ahead
in the file.  If that data is eventually used, the readahead size (and the
size of folios used for that data) will be increased.  For text, though, it
is unusual for that asynchronous area to be accessed quickly, so everything
ends up in small folios.  A better approach, he said, would be to say that
the asynchronous readahead just is not useful for text areas.  Instead, the
kernel could simply read the 64KB folio around the fault, without the
speculative read beyond that folio.  Then, he said, most text would end up
in larger folios, which would be mapped together in the fault handler;
that, in turn, makes it easy to set the page-table-entry bit needed for TLB coalescing
on Arm systems.
<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
A participant asked whether it would be better to just use large folios
unconditionally throughout the page cache; Roberts answered that the
readahead code gets to that point anyway when large folios appear to make sense.
Shakeel Butt pointed out that a lot of applications are built with their
binaries organized into sections; perhaps there would be some useful hints
there?  Matthew Wilcox said that the compilers don't leave that information
in the resulting binary, so those hints are not really available.
<p>
Wilcox went on to say that he had learned a lot about the readahead code
from the presentation â€” leading Roberts to interject that Wilcox had
<i>written</i> the readahead code.  Wilcox said that the proposal makes
sense in general, that the kernel should use 64KB pages for text.  The
readahead code, he said, is optimized for data, but text does not behave
like data.
<p>
Roberts moved on to the performance results, making it clear that he was
only showing tests that improve with the new behavior.  There were no
performance regressions, though, just some workloads that did not show any
difference.  Overall, he said, most workloads saw a 4-8% performance
improvement; that is less than the 12% that comes from going to a 64KB page
size overall, but still worthwhile.
<p>
He offered a few options for how this feature could be controlled, with the
first being that each architecture would provide a preferred folio size for
text mappings.  The readahead code would gain a special case for memory
areas that are mapped with execute permission; it would just perform a 64KB
synchronous read in that case.  If any of the pages in that folio are
already in the page cache, though, then smaller reads would be performed.
This solution would be entirely contained within the kernel, he said.  He
<a href="/ml/all/20240215154059.2863126-1-ryan.roberts@arm.com/">posted an
implementation</a> of this option in February 2024, but received an objection
that architectures should not be setting the folio size, so this work went
cold.
<p>
The second option would be to add a sysfs knob to allow the administrator
to set the preferred folio size for text.  He expressed a lack of
enthusiasm for more knobs, though.  The third option would be for the
dynamic linker to make this decision at load time; a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_madvise.2.html"><tt>process_madvise()</tt></a>
call could be made to inform the kernel of its decision.  This moves the
responsibility to user space and, he said, would create a new ABI, so he
thought that this option was best avoided.
<p>
Hildenbrand asked whether the <tt>khugepaged</tt> kernel thread could
assemble larger folios after the fact; Wilcox said that it can do that now,
but it tends not to run when it would be most useful.  It would be far
better, he said, to create the larger folios from the beginning.
Hildenbrand asked if it would make sense to use a larger size, perhaps
even&nbsp;2MB, but Wilcox said that most executable segments are smaller
than that.
<p>
The fourth option, Roberts said, was not the right solution, but it had
been raised on the list: the filesystem holding an executable could set the
folio size.  It could use the same infrastructure as the recently added
large-block-size support.  But, he said, there is no way for a filesystem
to know which files should receive this treatment, or what a reasonable
value would be.  A filesystem-set size would also apply to the entire file,
not just the text segments with it.  As an extra bonus, he said, this
option would have to be implemented in every filesystem separately.
<p>
The session closed with a suggestion from Wilcox that the first option
should be implemented.  The others, he said, can always be added later if
they seem to make sense.  Roberts has subsequently <a

Is there a risk that a synchronous 64k read will be slower than a smaller synchronous read + asynchronous read-ahead?  In particular older systems with spinning rust drives? Though I guess one could make the argument that once you have positioned the seek head, reading 64k is about as fast as reading 4k?<br>

As you said, it is seeking that is expensive with hard drives.<br>
Whether you read 4kB or 64kB does not really make a difference.<br>
It could probably be benchmarked with fio if you need to check.<br>

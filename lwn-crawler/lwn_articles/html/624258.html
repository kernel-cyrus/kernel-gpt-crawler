           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 3, 2014</br>
           </div>
It is no secret that the Linux kernel has grown over time; the constant
addition of features and hardware support means that almost every
development cycle adds more code than it removes.  The good news is that,
for most of us, the increase in hardware speed and size has far outstripped
the growth of the kernel, so few of us begrudge the extra resources that a
larger kernel
requires.  Developers working on tiny systems, though, are still concerned
about every byte consumed by the kernel.  Accommodating their needs seems
likely to be a source of ongoing stress in the community.
<p>
The latest example comes from <a href="/Articles/624259/">Pieter Smith's
patch set</a> to remove support for the <tt>splice()</tt> family of system
calls, including <tt>sendfile()</tt> and <tt>tee()</tt>.  There will be
many tiny systems with 
dedicated applications that have no need for those calls; removing them
from the kernel makes 8KB of memory available for other purposes.  The
Linux "tinification" developers see that as a worthwhile gain, but some
others disagree.
<p>
In particular, David Miller <a href="/Articles/624260/">opposed the
change</a>, saying "<q>I think starting to compile out system calls is a
very slippery slope we should not begin the journey down.</q>"  He
worries that, even if a specific system works today without
<tt>splice()</tt>, there may be a surprise tomorrow when some library
starts using that system call.  Developers working on Linux systems, David
appears to be arguing, should be able to count on having the basic system
call set available to them anywhere.
<p>
The tinification developers have a couple of answers to this concern.  One
is that developers working on tiny systems know what they are doing and
which system calls they can do without.  As Josh Triplett <a
href="/Articles/624261/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We're talking about embedded systems small enough that you're
	booting with init=/your/app and don't even call fork(), where you
	know exactly what code you're putting in and what libraries you
	use.  And they're almost certainly not running glibc.
</div>
<p>
The other response is that the kernel has, in fact, provided support for
compiling out major subsystems since the beginning.  <a
href="/Articles/624262/">Quoting Josh</a> again:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	It's not a "slippery slope"; it's been our standard practice for
	ages.  We started down that road long, long ago, when we first
	introduced Kconfig and optional/modular features.  /dev/* are
	user-facing interfaces, yet you can compile them out or make them
	modular.  /sys/* and/proc/* are user-facing interfaces, yet you can
	compile part or all of them out.  Filesystem names passed to mount
	are user-facing interfaces, yet you can compile them out.
</div>
<p>
(This list goes on for some time; see the original mail for all the
details).  Eric Biederman <a href="/Articles/624263/">added</a> that the
SYSV IPC system calls have been optional for a long time, and Alan Cox <a
href="/Articles/624264/">listed more optional items</a> as well.  David
finally <a href="/Articles/624265/">seemed to concede</a> that making
system calls optional was not a new thing for the Linux kernel, but he
stopped short of actually supporting the <tt>splice()</tt> removal patch.
<p>
Without his opposition, though, this patch may go in.  But a look at <a
href="https://tiny.wiki.kernel.org/projects">the kernel tinification
project list</a> makes it clear that this discussion is likely to return in
the future.  The tinification developers would like to be able to compile
out support for SMP systems, random number generation, signal handling,
capabilities, non-root users, sockets, the ability for processes to exit,
and more.  Eventually, they would like to have an automated tool that can
examine a user-space image and build a configuration removing every system
call that the given programs do not use.
<p>
Needless to say, any kernel that has been stripped down to that extent will
not resemble a contemporary Linux system.  But, on the other hand, neither
do the ancient (but much smaller) kernels that these users often employ
now.  If Linux wants to have a place on tiny systems, the kernel will have
to adapt to the resource constraints that come with such systems.  That
will bring challenges beyond convincing developers to allow important
functionality to be configured out; the tinification developers will also
have to figure out a way to allow this configuration without introducing
large numbers of new configuration options and adding complexity to the
build system.
<p>
It looks like a hard line to walk.  But the Linux kernel embodies the
solution to a lot of hard problems already; where there are willing
developers, there is usually a way.  If the tinification developers can
find a way here, Linux has a much better chance of being present on the
tiny systems that are likely to be embedded in all kinds of devices in the
coming years.  That seems like a goal worth trying for.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It seems a little myopic to assume this work is only useful in the context of embedded systems living inside car keys or whatever else. Library operating systems are hardly a new concept (with new ones appearing constantly, e.g. MirageOS or Arrakis), and with the continuous improvement we're seeing in storage hierarchy latencies, are very unlikely to disappear any time soon.<br>
<p>
Improving modularization of the kernel in the short term may eventually lead it to remaining competitive with application designs optimized either for extreme efficiency (as we already see in commercial settings -- e.g. HFT, process control) or containerization (assuming at some point, compute time is no longer sold in quantities as brutally coarse as double-digit percentage slices of the host machine).<br>

Compiling out fundamental unix features like signals, exit, non-root users... sounds pretty strange. Wouldn't that be the sign that you really should use some other kernel?<br>

      <p>I think the whole idea is that the parts you need would still work.  This is for really tiny, hardware-constrained embedded applications.  That means that both the hardware and software are tightly defined, and it should be relatively easy to list exactly which features of the kernel are ever used.  If the tools for listing used features and removing unneeded ones are well written, trimming the kernel to the bare minimum should be simple enough to be part of a standard development process.

      <blockquote>removing them from the kernel makes 8KB of memory available for other purposes.</blockquote>
Is that because the kernel code is 8Kbyte smaller or because the working memory needed by the kernel is less?  Or a combination of both?  (It might matter if some embedded systems want to put the kernel in ROM, I guess.)

"working memory" as a concept doesn't really apply to the kernel, as the kernel is (currently) completely resident in memory.  Making that NOT SO, is yet another possible tinification project.  But maybe you're just referring to the difference between code and data.<br>

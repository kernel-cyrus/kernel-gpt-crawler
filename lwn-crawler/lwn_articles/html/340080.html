Making the best use of available memory is one of the biggest challenges
for any operating system.  Throwing virtualization into the mix adds both
new challenges (balancing memory use between guests, for example) and
opportunities (sharing pages between guests).  Developers have responded
with technologies like hot-plug memory and <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/330589/">KSM</a>, but nobody seems to think
that the problem is fully solved.  Transcendent memory is a new
memory-management technique which, it is hoped, will improve the system's
use of scarce RAM, regardless of whether virtualization is being used.
<p>
In his <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/338098/">linux-kernel
introduction</a>, Dan Magenheimer asks:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	What if there was a class of memory that is of unknown and
	dynamically variable size, is addressable only indirectly by the
	kernel, can be configured either as persistent or as "ephemeral"
	(meaning it will be around for awhile, but might disappear without
	warning), and is still fast enough to be synchronously accessible?
</div>
<p>
Dan (along with a list of other kernel developers) is exploring this
concept, which he calls "transcendental memory."  In short, transcendental
memory can be thought of as a sort of RAM disk with some interesting
characteristics: nobody knows how big it is, writes to the disk may not
succeed, and, potentially, data written to the disk may vanish before being
read back again.  At a first blush, it may seem like a relatively useless
sort of device, but it is hoped that transcendental memory will be able to
improve performance in a few situations.
<p>
There is <a
href="http://oss.oracle.com/projects/tmem/dist/documentation/api/tmemspec-v001.pdf">an
API specification [PDF]</a> available; there is also a related C API found
in the patch itself.  This discussion will focus on the latter, which
suffers from less EXCESSIVE CAPITAL USE and is generally easier to
understand. 

<p>
Transcendental memory operates on the concept of page pools; once a pool is
created, data can be stored to pages within the pool.  The calls for
creating and destroying pools look like this:
<p>
<pre>
    u32 pool_id = tmem_new_pool(struct tmem_pool_uuid uuid, u32 flags)
    tmem_destroy_pool(u32 pool_id);
</pre>
<p>
Pools are identified by the <tt>uuid</tt> value, though the identification
really only matters for pools which might be shared among multiple users.
A fair amount of information is stored in the <tt>flags</tt> field,
including:
<p>
<ul>
<li> An "ephemeral" bit, which controls whether data successfully written 
     to the pool is allowed to disappear at a random future time.
<p>
<li> A "shared" bit indicating whether the pool is to be shared with other
     users. 
<p>
<li> The size of pages to use in the pool, expressed as a kernel "order"
     value.
<p>
<li> A specification version number, used to ensure that both sides of the
     conversation know how to understand each other.
</ul>
<p>
While users are expected to specify an expected page size, there is no way
to specify the size of the pool as a whole.  Determining the proper sizing
for a pool (which almost certainly changes over time) is left to the
hypervisor or whatever other software component is managing the pool.
<p>
As suggested by the above interface, transcendental memory is very much
page-based.  Beyond that, it also can never be referenced directly; users
are required to copy data into and out of the pool explicitly.  The
functions used for moving data between normal and transcendental memory are:
<p>
<pre>
    int tmem_put_page(u32 pool_id, u64 object_id, u32 page_id, unsigned long pfn);
    int tmem_get_page(u32 pool_id, u64 object_id, u32 page_id, unsigned long pfn);
</pre>
<p>
For both of these calls, <tt>pool_id</tt> specifies an existing pool.  The
<tt>object_id</tt> and <tt>page_id</tt> values, together, form a unique
identifier for the page within the pool.  If the pool is being used to
cache file pages, for example, the <tt>object_id</tt> would identify the
file, while <tt>page_id</tt> would be the offset within the file.
<tt>pfn</tt> (a page frame number) identifies the page which is the source
of the data (for 
<tt>tmem_put_page()</tt>) or the destination (<tt>tmem_get_page()</tt>).
<p>
Note that either call might fail.  Since the size of the pool is not known,
callers can never know in advance whether <tt>tmem_put_page()</tt> will
succeed.  So any transcendental memory user must have a backup plan ready
in case the call fails.  For pools marked as "ephemeral,"
<tt>tmem_get_page()</tt> is allowed to fail even if
<tt>tmem_put_page()</tt> on the same ID succeeded; in other words, the
implementation is allowed to drop pages from ephemeral pools if it decides
that the memory can be put to better use elsewhere.  It's also worth noting
that, with private, ephemeral pools, <tt>tmem_get_page()</tt> will remove
the indicated page from the pool.
<p>
As an example of how this feature might be used, consider the Linux page
cache, which maintains copies of pages from disk files.  When memory gets
tight, the page cache will start forgetting pages which are clean, but
which have not been referenced in the recent past.  With transcendental
memory, the page cache could, before dropping the pages, attempt to store
them into an ephemeral transcendental memory pool.  At some future time,
when one of those pages is needed again, the page cache would first attempt to fetch
it from the pool.  If the <tt>tmem_get_page()</tt> call succeeds, a disk
I/O operation will have been avoided and everybody benefits; otherwise the
page is read from disk as usual.
<p>
Persistent (non-ephemeral) pools could be used as a sort of swap device.
If the swapping 
code succeeds in writing a page to the pool, it can avoid writing it to the
real swap device.  The result is saved I/O at both swap-out and swap-in
times.  If the pool lacks space for the swapped page, it will be written to
the real swap device in the usual way.
<p>
Meanwhile, the transcendental memory implementation can try to optimize its
management of the memory pools.  Guests which are more active (or which
have been given a higher priority) might be allowed to allocate more pages
from the pools.  Duplicate pages can be coalesced; KSM-like techniques
could be used, but the use of object IDs could make it easier to detect
duplicates in a number of situations.  And so on.
<p>
The API specifies a number of other operations.  There are a couple of
calls to flush pages from the pool; one of them can remove all pages with a
given object ID.  Sub-page-size reads and writes are supported; there is
also a <tt>tmem_xchg()</tt> call to atomically exchange data within a
transcendental memory page.  See the API specification for the full list.
<p>
A number of concerns were raised in the subsequent discussion; as a result,
the above API is likely to change a bit.  The biggest concern, though,
appears to be security.  The potential for hostile code to tap into shared
pools and read out pages has developers worried; the need to guess a
128-bit UUID first has proved not to be sufficiently reassuring.  Even with
legitimate users only, a shared pool has the potential to contain data
which should not, in reality, be shared between guests.  As a result, any
transcendental memory user will have to be written to take high-level
security issues into account in low-level code.
<p>
Dan seemingly doesn't see the security problems as being as worrisome as
others do.  Even so, he eventually <a
href="/Articles/340087/">announced</a> that the next transcendental memory
patch would not include support for shared pools, and, indeed, <a
href="/Articles/340409/">version&nbsp;2</a> lacks that feature.  That feature will
probably not come back until the security issues have been thought through
and the concerns have been addressed.
<p>
Beyond that, transcendental memory will need some convincing evidence that
it improves performance before it can make it into the mainline.  The
potential for improvements is clearly there; it is essentially a way for
the system to take higher-level information into account when managing its
virtual memory resources.  If transcendental memory is able to fulfill that
potential in a secure way, there may well be a place for it in the mainline
kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

"the need to guess a 128-bit UUID first has proved not to be sufficiently <br>
reassuring"? This is mystifying. If it's sufficiently random (which as a <br>
UUID it had better be), brute-forcing any of the pool IDs is going to be <br>
next to impossible. Are people with 128-bit secret keys worried that <br>
someone is going to guess their key by brute force? No: they're worried <br>
about attacks that avoid brute-forcing and reduce the search space.<br>

Why limit your security to a shared secret when you can implement stronger policies within the hypervisor itself?<br>
<p>
A common requirement with virtualization is to implement "chinese wall" security policies.  Imagine if you had a single box that was running a production server as a VM for both Coke and Pepsi.  No matter what, neither company wants there to be any chance that the other one can access it's data.  The hypervisor must be able to enforce that.  If the Pepsi VM was somehow able to obtain the UUID for the Coke shared tmem pool (even if it was because of a bug in the Coke server), you'd have one unhappy customer.<br>
<p>
If you were to support a memory sharing system like this, you would want the available pools to be enumerated by the hypervisor.  You likely want to support dynamic pools too so you need some way to hot add/remove pools.  Using uuids is certainly a reasonable means of identifying pools but the point is that you need a more coherent strategy for exposing the pools to the guest that is arbitrated by the hypervisor.<br>

If we're talking about a shared system, then at some point that UUID has to be shared amongst hosts.  I think the fear is that a hacked client will be able to see the UUIDs used by other clients, and therefore be able to use those UUIDs directly rather than having to guess them.<br>

Ow. Yeah, that's plausible, but unfortunately it would apply to all other shared-secret mechanisms too :/ basically if people can steal your key, you've lost. (But if they can steal your key they can presumably steal anything else they care to, as well.)<br>

Sharing data between the guests.  If both guests have an identical binary loaded up from their identical page cache of their identical read only /usr, why copy it into memory twice and waste the space and incur the cache/copying/performance overhead?<br>

I don't see how that's possible with this API though. Or rather, how the API has any influence on it.<br>
<p>
See, if the host were to hash the pages I gave it (from the guest) with this API, and memcmp() them, it could with very little effort tell me it's stored it even though it just made a note that my ID(s) point to that particular page, and refcounted the page. This is easy since a page, once pushed from the guest to the host, is immutable.<br>
<p>
The way the article was written though it seems that with the shared stuff, different hosts could access the same page frame by the same ID. So guest A could push out a page and guest B could retrieve it with that same ID? Where's the use in that?<br>

If the client were responsible for hashing the page contents to produce the UUID, then the kernel wouldn't have to do it; it could rely on the UUID itself to identify sharable pages automatically.<br>

What's supposed to be "transcendent" about this memory?  It seems more "transient" to me.  We're not talking about memories of past lives or Jungian archetypes.<br>

      Dan <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=124570385801680">explained</a> his choice of "transcendent" in the original <a href="http://marc.info/?t=124545573200001">thread</a>:
<br>
<blockquote><i>
&gt; While true that this memory is "exceeding usual limits", the more<br>
&gt; important criteria is that it may disappear.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It might be clearer to just call it "ephemeral memory".
<p>
Ephemeral tmem (precache) may be the most interesting, but there
is persistent tmem (preswap) as well.  Both are working today
and both are included in the patches I posted.
<p>
Looking for a term encompassing both, I chose "transcendent".

"As an example of how this feature might be used, consider the Linux page cache, which maintains copies of pages from disk files. When memory gets tight, the page cache will start forgetting pages which are clean, but which have not been referenced in the recent past. With transcendental memory, the page cache could, before dropping the pages, attempt to store them into an ephemeral transcendental memory pool."<br>
<p>
I don't understand why it is better to move a page to transcendent memory instead of keeping it in the page cache. The same amount of memory is needed in both cases. Can someone enlight me?<br>

The only difference is who decides to drop it -- if it's in the page cache that decision has to be made by the guest, if it's in the transcendent memory that decision can be made by the host too, if _it_ needs memory.<br>

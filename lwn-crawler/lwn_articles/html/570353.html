           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 15, 2013</br>
           </div>
Power-aware scheduling attempts to place processes on CPUs in a way that
minimizes the system's overall consumption of power.  Discussion in this
area has been muted since we <a href="/Articles/554956/">last looked at it</a> in
June, but work has been proceeding.  Now a new set of power-aware
scheduling patches shows a significant change in direction motivated by
criticisms that were aired in June.  This particular problem is far from
solved, but the shape of the eventual solution may be becoming a bit more
clear.
<p>
Thus far, most of the power-aware scheduling patches posted to the lists
have been focused on task placement â€” 
packing "small" processes onto a small number of CPUs to allow others to be
powered down, for example.  The problem with that approach, as Ingo Molnar
<a href="/Articles/552885/">complained</a> at the time, was that it failed
to recognize that there are several mechanisms used to control CPU power
consumption.  These include the cpuidle subsystem (which decides when a CPU
can sleep and how deeply), the cpufreq subsystem (charged with controlling
the clock frequency for CPUs) and various aspects of the scheduler itself.
There is no integration between these subsystems; indeed, the scheduler is
almost entirely ignorant of what the cpuidle and cpufreq controllers are
doing.  There are other problems as well: the notion of controlling a CPU's
frequency has been effectively rendered obsolete by current processor
designs, for example.
<p>
In the end, Ingo said that no power-aware scheduling patches would be
considered for merging until these problems were solved.  In other words,
the developers working on these patches needed to solve not just their
problem, but the problem of rationalizing and integrating the work that has
been done by other developers in preceding years.  Such things happen in
kernel development; it can be hard on individual developers, but it does
result in better code in the long term.
<p>
<h4>The latest approach</h4>
<p>
To address this challenge, Morten Rasmussen, who has been working on the <a
href="/Articles/541005/">big LITTLE MP scheduler</a>, has taken a step back;
his latest <a href="/Articles/570162/">power-aware scheduling patch set</a>
does not actually introduce much in the way of power-aware scheduling.
Instead, it is focused on the creation of an internal API that governs
communications between the scheduler and a new type of "power driver" that
is meant to eventually replace the cpuidle and cpufreq subsystems.  The
power driver (there can only be one for all CPUs in the current patch set)
provides these operations to the scheduler:
<p>
<pre>
    struct power_driver {
	int (*at_max_capacity)	(int cpu);
	int (*go_faster)	(int cpu, int hint);
	int (*go_slower)	(int cpu, int hint);
	int (*best_wake_cpu)	(void);
	void (*late_callback)	(int cpu);
    };
</pre>
<p>
Two of these methods allow the scheduler to query the power state of a
given CPU; <tt>at_max_capacity()</tt> allows the scheduler to ask whether the
processor is running at full speed, while <tt>best_wake_cpu()</tt> asks
which (sleeping) CPU would be the best to wake in response to increasing
load.  The <tt>best_wake_cpu()</tt> call can make use of low-level
architectural knowledge to determine which CPU would require the least
power to bring up; it would, for example, favor CPUs that share power or
clock lines with currently running CPUs over those that would require
powering up a new package.
<p>
The scheduler can provide feedback to the power driver with the
<tt>go_faster()</tt> and <tt>go_slower()</tt> methods.  These calls request
higher or lower speed from the given CPU without specifying an actual clock
frequency, which isn't really possible on a lot of current processors.  The
power driver can then instruct the hardware to adopt a power policy that
matches what the scheduler is asking for.  The <tt>hint</tt> parameter is
not used in the current patch set; its purpose is to indicate how much
faster or slower performance the scheduler would like to see.  These calls
as a whole are hints, actually; the power driver is not required to carry
out the scheduler's wishes.
<p>
Finally, <tt>late_callback()</tt> exists to allow the power driver to
do work that may require sleeping or having interrupts enabled.  Most of
the functions listed above can be called from within the scheduler at
almost any point, so they have to be written to run in atomic context.  If
they need to do something that cannot be done in that context, they can set
the work aside; the scheduler will call <tt>late_callback()</tt> at a safe
time for that work to be done.
<p>
The current patch set makes just enough use of these functions to show how
they would be used.  Whenever the scheduler adds a process to a given CPU's
run queue, it checks whether the total load exceeds what the CPU is able to
provide; if so, a call to <tt>go_faster()</tt> will be made to ask for more
performance.  A similar test is done whenever a process is removed from a
CPU; if that CPU is providing more power than is needed,
<tt>go_slower()</tt> will be called.  A separate test will call
<tt>go_faster()</tt> if the idle time on the CPU is low, even if the
computed load suggests that the CPU should not be busy.  Rudimentary
implementations of <tt>go_faster()</tt> and <tt>go_slower()</tt> have been
provided; they are a simple wrapper around the existing cpufreq driver
code. 
<p>
<h4>What's coming</h4>
<p>
The full plan (as described in <a
href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2013/ocw//system/presentations/1263/original/Unifying_Power_Policies_LPC.pdf">Morten's
Linux Plumbers Conference talk slides [PDF]</a>) calls for the elimination
of cpufreq and cpuidle altogether once their functionality has been pulled
into the power driver.  There will also be several more
functions to be provided by the power driver.  These include
<tt>get_best_sleep_cpu()</tt> to get a hint for the best CPU to put asleep,
<tt>enter_idle()</tt> to actually put a CPU into the sleep state,
<tt>load_scale()</tt> to help with the calculation of loads regardless of
the CPU's current power state, and <tt>task_boost()</tt> to give priority
to a specific CPU.  <tt>task_boost()</tt> is aimed at systems that provide
features like "turbo mode," where one CPU can be overclocked, but only if
the others are idle.
<p>
The long-term plan also involves bringing back techniques like <a
href="/Articles/520857/">small-task packing</a>, proper support for
big.LITTLE systems, and more.  But those goals look distant at the moment;
Morten and company must first build a consensus around the proposed
architecture.  That may take some doing, yet; scheduler developer Peter
Zijlstra's <a href="/Articles/570374/">first response</a> was "<q>I
don't see anything except a random bunch of hooks without an over-all
picture of how to get less power used.</q>"  Morten has promised to fill
out the story.
<p>
Some of these issues may be resolved on October 23, when a <a
href="/Articles/570375/">half-day minisummit</a> will be held on the topic
in Edinburgh.  Many of the relevant developers should be there, allowing
for quick resolution of a number of the outstanding issues.  With luck,
your editor will be there too; stay tuned for the next episode in this
long-running story.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

How can the kernel measure what may help allocate resources without interfering with user-space measurement of other quantities?  CPU counters are a limited resource.  The mix of memory ops v. computational ops may guide power scheduling, but measuring that will require counters and limit those available to user space.<br>
<p>
There's a ton of research going on right now.  I'm not sure how best to couple the sometimes too-academic research with the sometimes too-practical hacking.<br>

"In other words, the developers working on these patches needed to solve not just their problem, but the problem of rationalizing and integrating the work that has been done by other developers in preceding years."<br>
<p>
I suppose this is a semantic nitpick, but it seems to me, based on the well-argued position in the article that an integrated approach is necessary for an effective solution, that "their problem" - the solution to the problem these developers are working on (IMO effective power-aware scheduling) requires a comprehensive, integrated analysis and implementation.  Thus, I would prefer to reword this sentence as:<br>
<p>
'In other words, the developers working on these patches need to solve not just the narrow problem-set they've so far been working on, but the problem of rationalizing and integrating the work that has been done by other developers in preceding years.'<br>

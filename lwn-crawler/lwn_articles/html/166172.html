<div class="ArticleText">
Kernel programmers tend to like inline functions.  They resemble C macros,
in that they result in code inserted directly into the calling function,
with no added function call overhead.  But, unlike macros, they offer type
checking and the ability to include multiple lines of code without adding a
pile of backslashes.  In cases where a function is optimized out entirely,
an inline function turns into no code at all - a level of efficiency which
is hard to beat.  And, in some cases, inlining is required; consider, for
example, functions which embody special assembly instructions needed by the
kernel. 
<p>

Inline functions also have their costs, however.  Their code is duplicated
for every call, so inline functions which are called from more than one
place make the kernel larger.  Increasingly, developers are becoming aware
that this size increase carries a performance penalty.  As the gap between CPU
and memory speeds grows, cache behavior increasingly determines how fast a
program runs.  So the performance benefits of inline functions are often,
at best, illusory, and sometimes negative; a larger kernel will be a slower
kernel.
<p>

Ingo Molnar recently <a href="/Articles/166182/">raised this issue</a> with
a set of patches changing how the kernel is built.  By turning on
unit-at-a-time compilation (which causes gcc to consider an entire file in
its optimization decisions) and by turning off forced inlining, he was able
to achieve a 5.3% size reduction.  Taking things to an extreme, and
applying these patches to an "allyesconfig" kernel (one with all
configuration options turned on) <a href="/Articles/166184/">results</a> in
a nearly 25% smaller kernel. 
That is, to say the least, a significant size reduction to be achieved by
such a small patch.  Anybody interested in de-bloating the kernel should be
paying attention.
<p>

These patches have not been accepted by everybody, however.  In particular,
the turning off of forced inlining is controversial.  When gcc is not
forced to honor the <tt>inline</tt> keyword, it makes its own decisions,
based on the size of the function and how many times it is called.  When
told to optimize for size, in particular, gcc will have a strong bias
against inline functions.  This approach yields a significant size
reduction, but there is a problem: Linus <a href="/Articles/166186/">doesn't
trust the gcc maintainers</a> to code consistent and correct inline
heuristics, and <a href="/Articles/166187/">Andrew Morton doesn't
either</a>.  Rather than turning off forced inlining and letting gcc figure
things out, they would rather go through the code and remove unnecessary
inline declarations one by one.
<p>

It is true that the kernel has been burned by changes to how gcc handles
<tt>inline</tt> in the past.  Since then, gcc seems to have gotten smarter,
and one can argue that its maintainers have become more aware of the
issues.  There is also the little fact that cleaning up the existing inline
declarations is not a small job; <a href="/Articles/166190/">Ingo says:</a>
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	There are 22,000+ inline functions in the kernel right now (inlined
	about a 100,000 times), and we'd have to change _thousands_ of them.
	They are causing an unjustified code bloat of somewhere around
	20-30%.
</div>
<p>
Arjan van de Ven <a href="/Articles/166192/">adds</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The reality is, most driver writers (in fact kernel code writers)
	tend to overestimate the gain of inline in THEIR code, and to
	underestimate the cumulative cost of it. Despite what akpm says, I
	think gcc can make a better judgement than most of these authors
	(probably including me :). We can remove 6400 now, but a year from
	now, another 1000 have been added back again I bet.
</div>
<p>

How all of this will turn out is unclear.  Certainly one can expect a
higher level of resistance to patches adding inline functions in the
future.  There is likely to be a long flurry of de-inlining patches as
well.  The ability to turn off forced inlining might be added to the build
system as an experimental option;  some distributors may even decide to use this
option for the kernels they ship.  But enough developers seem uncomfortable
with the idea of turning off forced inlining wholesale that this option may
not get beyond the "experimental" stage for some time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Not mentioned in the article is one important and often overlooked fact about inlining:  Inlining happens automatically.  This is just about <em>forced</em> inlining.  Even without the "inline" keyword, Gcc will inline a function if it looks beneficial.  I think current versions have a way to explicitly <em>exclude</em> a function from inlining.
<p>
So one really should use "inline" only where one has reason to believe he's smarter than Gcc, and forced inlining should always be respected.
<p>
One other reason to use "inline" is where you use that warning option that warns you about unused functions.  If you put a function in a header file, since not every file that includes the header file will use that function, you get that warning if you don't declare "inline".

      It used to be that no-one trusted compilers to do register allocation <br>
optimally either, but now they do (admittedly there is a canonical <br>
algorithm for it, which AFAIK isn't the case for inlining) so the <br>
register keyword is vestigial. <br>
 <br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Gcc will inline [any] function if it looks beneficial.  </font><br>
  <br>
Only if it's in the same compilation unit -- if there's only a prototype  <br>
available, the compiler can see no code to inline. <br>
 <br>
As things stand at the moment, only functions which developers think <br>
should be inlined are available in the API headers, and those are *all* <br>
marked with the inline keyword -- there'd be no point putting a function <br>
in a header if you didn't want it inlined. <br>
 <br>
unit-at-a-time optimisation is an improvement, but it falls waaay short <br>
of whole-program optimisation.  When that's available I'm sure no one <br>
will trust the compiler -- initially. <br>

      I read through the discussion thread and didn't find any information about the performance impact of removing the inlining. While it's not unreasonable to think that cache hit rates would improve, it would be nice to see some data indicating what the bottom line performance change is.<br>

      point is, it is very hard to measure. it can make a difference, but no <br>

      Benchmarking is hard and people use it to lie a lot. On the other hand, though, the reason people do inlining, usually, is to improve performance, so you'd think that somebody pushing reduced inlining would have done some kind of performance study to see if the changes hurt performance unacceptably.<br>
<p>
In other words, I'm not concerned about whether the experiments are scalable or universally applicable, but it would be interesting to know whether it had had any observable effect on whatever ingo chose to observe.<br>
<p>
I'd be especially interested in things like interrupt latency, which I would expect Ingo to be well-prepared to measure.<br>

      The effect of code duplicating optimizations (like inlining) on cache<br>
miss rates can be counterintuitive.  E.g., Mueller and Whaley [1]<br>
tried an optimizationm that increased code size by 50%, and found that<br>
it reduced the number of cache misses.<br>
<p>
In the context of our work on replication in interpreters we have<br>
tried to use partial replication to reduce the code size by a factor<br>
of two or more (compared to full replication), but found that this<br>
increased the cache misses significantly; partial inlining resulted in<br>
worse spatial locality, and apparently this had more influence than<br>
the code size.  This research is not yet published.<br>
<p>
Here is a scenario where de-inlining can increase cache misses:<br>
Consider that a function is inlined in several places in the kernel,<br>
but these different places are called so far apart that the function<br>
is expelled from the cache between these executions.  Then de-inlining<br>
has no benefit for the cache hit rate; but it can have a cost:<br>
<p>
- the direct cost is that the function probably does not utilize all<br>
of the cache line where it starts and where it ends (whereas the<br>
inlined version would share these lines with the caller which is also<br>
executed).  I.e., de-inlining reduces spatial locality.<br>
<p>
- the indirect cost is that optimizations enabled by inlining are<br>
suppressed, and these optimizations may reduce the code size and thus<br>
the cache footprint.<br>

IMHO, is the distribution of function calls per "average" kernel.<br>
And even better, per specific kernel.<br>
<p>
Why not run the kernel with no inlineing and oprofile, determine which are , say, the 10% of the inlined functions called 90% of the time, and run an automated "deinlining" script ?<br>

      <p>It's not that simple unfortunately. If one was to try to give each function a "score" for inlining, where larger numbers mean better to inline, one might use at least the following rules:</p>


<ul>
<li>Function is called very frequently (+, large potential benefit)</li>
<li>Function is is very small and simple (+, low code bloat)</li>
<li>Function is called from many different locations (-, high code bloat)</li>
</ul>

<p>... and I don't doubt there are more factors I've missed, especially when considering cache and register use issues. I'm about as far from an expert as you might find - "not totally clueless" perhaps.</p>

<p>As far as I know the ideal inline function is something like:</p>

<pre>
int one() { return 1; }
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
int addone(int in) { return in+1; }
</pre>

<p>or perhaps something slightly more complex that's called from relatively few places. Forcing the inlining of:</p>

<pre>
void runEventLoop()
{
   // 100 lines of branch-heavy event dispatch code including
   // infrequently used cases, error handling, etc
}
</pre>

<p>... could to very nasty things to your program's binary size and performance if it's called from many places at all.</p>

<p>Whether to inline a function is not simple to evaluate from static analysis of source code. The compiler does a somewhat better job, and can be given directives to control its inlining behaviour. Given this, it seems sensible to only force inlining where you know the compiler gets it wrong, or where you know it's absolutely critical to inline a function.</p>

      One thing that's missing from this discussion is that in many cases you want some invocations of function F to be inlined and other invocations of the same function to NOT be inlined. In particular invocations of F in hot paths should be inlined and invocations in cold, infrequently executed code should not (unless inlining F is actually smaller than a regular function call to F). You can't get this effect just by twiddling 'inline' declarations in the source, so the compiler (perhaps assisted with profile information) can actually do a better job then you can at the source level (unless you go around inline the code by hand in the source code, which is madness).<br>

      In the case where you want to a function to be inline in some cases and not others what about:<br>
<p>
int small_function(int val)<br>
{<br>
    return val+1;<br>
}<br>
<p>
void main()<br>
{<br>
   int i = 0;<br>
 <br>
   for(i = 0; i &lt; 10000; i++)<br>
   {<br>
       small_function() __inline__<br>
   }<br>
}<br>
<p>
This would support selective inlining, and also helps the programmer who is new to the code visualize what is going on - you don't need to see the definiton of small_function() to see that the function will be inlined.<br>

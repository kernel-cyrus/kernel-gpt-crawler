           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2012/">2012 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
<p> The final session of day one of the 2012 Kernel Summit considered 
the <tt>linux-next</tt> tree and a possible complementary tree.

<p> Steven Rostedt stated that he'd like to have a "linux-devel" tree,
which would serve a similar purpose to that once served by Andrew Morton's
"-mm" tree: it would be a place where reasonably stable code sits for a
while for longer testing. He noted that such a tree might be useful for an
API that hasn't yet stabilized, for example. Steven asked whether others
would also be interested in something like this.

<p> Chris Mason questioned whether such a tree could work in
practice. "<q>When your work and my work are together, people blame me
for your bugs and vice versa.</q>" Based on experience with a similar
approach in another project, Ben Herrenschmidt noted another problem: people
started developing against that code base instead of the designated
development base (i.e., the creation of a "linux-devel" might cause some
people to develop against that tree instead of <tt>linux-next</tt>).  Tony
Luck noted that the value of a "linux-devel" tree would depend greatly on
how much testing it received, and the sense was that such a tree would
likely see less testing than <tt>linux-next</tt>, which itself could do
with more testers.

<p> Of course, even if a "linux-devel" tree was considered
worthwhile, the tree would need a maintainer. In response to the question
of how much work was required to maintain <tt>linux-next</tt>, the
maintainer, Stephen Rothwell, said it required between four and ten hours
per day, depending on the stage in the kernel-release cycle.
In the end, as Steven Rostedt himself noted, the overall response to the
proposal of a "linux-devel" tree was unenthusiastic.

<p> Attention then briefly turned to the <tt>linux-next</tt> tree. Ted Ts'o
asked: are people happy with how the tree was working? The overall
consensus seemed to be that it was working well. H.&nbsp;Peter Anvin seemed
to sum up the mood, in stating his overall contentment with
<tt>linux-next</tt> while noting that "<q>the imperfections of
<tt>linux-next</tt> are reflections of the fact that it is a real-world
creation</q>".  
Ted asked in a tone that seemed to expect a negative
answer, "<q>does anyone run <tt>linux-next</tt> in anger on their
development system?</q>", and was a little surprised to see that quite a
number of kernel developers indicated that they do eat their own dog
food, living pretty much continuously on <tt>linux-next</tt> as the booted kernel
on the work system that they use on a daily basis.
After more than three years, it's clear that
<tt>linux-next</tt> is by now an essential part of the kernel-development
model.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Here on the Kernel page, we frequently read about features that are maybe two or three cycles away from getting merged. What about setting up trees for future versions that would naturally turn into mainline after a new kernel is released? It could cut down on merge window chaos considerably.<br>
<p>
(For example, we're at 3.6-rc6 right now; we would have a 3.7-rc0, 3.8-rc0, and maybe 3.9-rc0, and when 3.6 is released, 3.7-rc0 becomes 3.7-rc1.)<br>
<p>
Does this make sense at all?<br>

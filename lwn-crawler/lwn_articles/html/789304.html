<p>The physical memory in a computer system is a precious resource, so a
lot of effort has been put into managing it effectively. This task is made
more difficult by the complexity of the memory architecture on contemporary
systems.  There are several
layers of abstraction that deal with the details of how physical memory
is laid out; one of those is simply called the "memory model".  There
are three models supported in the kernel, but one of them is on its way
out.  As a way of understanding this change, this article will
take a closer look at the evolution of the kernel's memory models,
their current state, and their possible future.

<p>
<h4>FLATMEM</h4>

<p>Back in the beginning of Linux, memory was flat: it was a simple linear sequence
with physical addresses starting at zero and ending
at several megabytes. Each physical page frame had an entry in the kernel's
<tt>mem_map</tt> array which, at that time, contained a single <tt>unsigned
short</tt> entry for each page that counted the number of references that page
had. Soon enough, though, the <tt>mem_map</tt> entries grew to also include
<tt>age</tt> and <tt>dirty</tt> counters for the management of swapping. In
Linux 
1.3.50 the elements of <tt>mem_map</tt> were finally named <tt>struct
page</tt>.

<p>The flat memory map provided easy and fast conversion between a
physical page-frame number (PFN) and its corresponding <tt>struct
page</tt>; it was a simple matter of calculating an array index.
There were changes in the layout of <tt>struct page</tt> to accommodate new
usages (the page cache, for example) and to optimize cache performance for
the <tt>struct page</tt> accesses. The memory map remained a flat array
that was neat and efficient, but it had a major drawback: it couldn't
deal well with large holes in the physical address space. Either the
part of the memory map corresponding to a hole would be wasted
or, as was done on ARM, the memory map would also have holes.
<p>
<h4>DISCONTIGMEM</h4>
<p>
<p>Support for the efficient handling of widely discontiguous physical
memory was introduced into the memory-management subsystem in 1999 as a
part of the
effort to make Linux work well on NUMA machines. This code was dependent on the
<tt>CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM</tt> configuration option, so the first memory
model that had a name was <tt>DISCONTIGMEM</tt>.

<p>The <tt>DISCONTIGMEM</tt> model introduced the notion of a memory node,
which remains the basis of NUMA memory management. Each node carries an
independent (well, mostly) memory-management subsystem with its own
free-page lists, in-use page lists, least-recently-used (LRU) information, and usage
statistics. Among all these goodies, the node data represented by
<tt>struct pglist_data</tt> (or <tt>pg_data_t</tt> for short) contains a
node-specific memory map.  Assuming that each node has contiguous physical
memory, having an array of <tt>page</tt> structures per node solves the
problem of large holes in the flat memory map.  <p>

But this doesn't come for free. With <tt>DISCONTIGMEM</tt>, it's necessary
to determine which node holds a given page in memory to turn its PFN into
the associated <tt>struct page</tt>, for
example.  Similarly, one must determine
which node's memory map contains a <tt>struct page</tt> to calculate its
PFN. After a long evolution, starting with the mips64 architecture defining the
<tt>KVADDR_TO_NID()</tt>, <tt>LOCAL_MAP_BASE()</tt>,
<tt>ADDR_TO_MAPBASE()</tt>, and <tt>LOCAL_BASE_ADDR()</tt> macros for the
first time, the conversion of a PFN to the <tt>struct page</tt> and vice
versa came to rely on the relatively simple <tt>pfn_to_page()</tt> and
<tt>page_to_pfn()</tt> macros defined in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/include/asm-generic/memory_model.h"><tt>include/asm-generic/memory_model.h</tt></a>.

<p><tt>DISCONTIGMEM</tt>, however, had a weak point: memory hotplug and hot
remove. The actual NUMA node granularity was too coarse for proper hotplug
support, and splitting the node would have created a lot of unnecessary
fragmentation and overhead. Remember that each node has an independent memory
management structure with all the associated costs; splitting nodes further would
increase those costs considerably.
<p>
<h4>SPARSEMEM</h4>

<p>This limitation was resolved with the introduction of
<tt>SPARSEMEM</tt>. This model abstracted the memory map as a collection of
sections of arbitrary size defined by the architectures. Each section,
represented by <tt><a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.2-rc1/source/include/linux/mmzone.h#L1165">struct
mem_section</a></tt>, is (as described in the code): "<q>logically, a
pointer to an array of struct pages.  However, it is stored with some other
magic</q>". The array of these sections is a meta-memory map which can
be efficiently chopped at <tt>SECTION_SIZE</tt> granularity. For efficient
conversion between a PFN and <tt>struct page</tt>, several high bits of the
PFN are used to index into the sections array. For the other direction, the
section number was encoded in the page flags.
<p>

A few months after its introduction into the Linux kernel,
<tt>SPARSEMEM</tt> was extended with <tt>SPARSEMEM_EXTREME</tt>, which is
suitable for systems with an especially sparse physical address space.
<tt>SPARSEMEM_EXTREME</tt> added a second dimension to the sections array
and made this array, well, sparse. With <tt>SPARSEMEM_EXTREME</tt>, the
first level became pointers to <tt>mem_section</tt> structures, and the actual
mem_section objects were dynamically allocated based on the actually
populated physical memory.

<p>Another enhancement to <tt>SPARSEMEM</tt> was added in 2007; it was
called <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8f6aac419bd">generic virtual
memmap support for <tt>SPARSEMEM</tt></a>, or
<tt>SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP</tt>. The idea 
behind <tt>SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP</tt> is that the entire memory map is mapped
into a virtually contiguous area, but only the active sections are backed
with physical pages. This model wouldn't work well with 32-bit systems,
where the physical memory size might approach or even exceed the virtual
address space. However, for 64-bit systems <tt>SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP</tt> is a
clear win. At the cost of additional page table entries,
<tt>page_to_pfn()</tt>, and <tt>pfn_to_page()</tt> became as simple as with
the flat model.

<p>The last extension of the <tt>SPARSEMEM</tt> memory model is more recent
(2016); it was driven by the increased use of persistent-memory
devices. To support storing the memory map directly on those devices rather
than in main memory, the virtual memory map can use <tt>struct
vmem_altmap</tt>, which will provide <tt>page</tt> structures in persistent
memory.

<p>Back in 2005, <tt>SPARSEMEM</tt> was described as a "<q>newer, and
more experimental alternative to 'discontiguous memory'</q>". The
commit that added <tt>SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP</tt> noted that it "<q>has the potential
to allow us to make <tt>SPARSEMEM</tt> the default (and even the only) option for
most systems</q>".  And indeed, several architectures have switched over
from <tt>DISCONTIGMEM</tt> to <tt>SPARSEMEM</tt>. In 2008,
<tt>SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP</tt> 
became the only supported memory model for x86-64, as it was only
slightly more expensive than <tt>FLATMEM</tt> but more efficient than
<tt>DISCONTIGMEM</tt>.

<p>Recent memory-management developments, such as memory hotplug,
persistent-memory support, and various performance optimizations, all target
the <tt>SPARSEMEM</tt> model.  But the older models still exist, which comes with the
cost of numerous <tt>#ifdef</tt> blocks in the architecture and
memory-management code, and a peculiar maze of related configuration
options.  There is an ongoing work to completely switch the remaining users
of <tt>DISCONTIGMEM</tt> to <tt>SPARSEMEM</tt>, but making the change for
such architectures as ia64 and mips64 won't be an easy task. And the ARC
architecture's
use of <tt>DISCONTIGMEM</tt> to represent a "high memory" area that
resides below the "normal" memory will definitely be challenging to change.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

If I remember right, the New York Stock Exchange and the Sabre flight reservation system switched wholesale to Linux on Itanic some years ago. They might still be on it.<br>
<p>
One can imagine HP-UX users migrating to Itanic emulations running Linux with an HP-UX compatibility layer, hosted on Linux amd64.<br>
<p>
It is the norm, nowadays, for enterprise software to be running on several layers of emulation, yet still running faster than on the original hardware. Emulators tend to be, themselves, the least portable of code, so they are, ironically, the first candidates to be emulated instead of ported.<br>
<p>
There are only two outcomes from any migration or upgrade of legacy code: it still works, or it doesn't work. So, people responsible for legacy systems become risk-averse. Emulation is less risky than porting, even with a wobbly tower of emulations. Emulating big-endian platforms on little-endian hardware is surprisingly practical.<br>

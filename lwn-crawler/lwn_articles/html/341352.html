           <p>July 15, 2009</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Goldwyn Rodrigues</p>
           </div>
<p> Changes are happening the way the virtual filesystem and virtual memory
subsystems interact. One of the goals of this work is to close a race existing in
<tt>page_mkwrite()</tt> (called when a previously read-only page table
entry (PTE) is about to
become writable), namely to make sure that file blocks are properly
zero-filled if a truncate operation increases the file size.
As a part of improving  <tt>page_mkwrite()</tt>, Jan Kara posted a set of <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/337548/">patches</a>. However, these
patches introduced a new lock to resolve the problem. Nick Piggin
thinks this can be done by using the page lock instead of a
new lock. As a first step toward a resolution of the problem, he posted a set of
<a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems/33900">patches</a>
to improve the truncate sequence. The new truncate sequence is simpler
to understand, flexible in usage, and  most
important of all, handles errors gracefully.

<p>
The <tt>truncate()</tt> and <tt>ftruncate()</tt> system calls are used to set a file 
to the specified size. If the file is larger
than the argument passed, the file size is truncated and the part of the
file greater than the passed file size is lost. If the current file size is
smaller than the passed file size argument, the file size is increased
and the area greater than the previous file size is filled with zeros. The
file size argument passed cannot be greater 
than the maximum possible file size on the filesystem.

<p>
A user space <tt>truncate()</tt> call is handled, inside the kernel, by
<tt>do_sys_truncate()</tt>, which is responsible for weeding out all
error cases (such as "the inode is a directory" or permission errors). It
breaks leases of files locked with <tt>flock()</tt> and calls
<tt>do_truncate()</tt>. <tt>do_truncate()</tt>, in turn,
creates a new attribute structure with
the new length of the file and calls <tt>notify_change()</tt> with the
<tt>dentry</tt>
and the new attributes under  <tt>inode-&gt;i_mutex</tt>.
<tt>notify_change()</tt> calls
the generic <tt>inode_setattr()</tt>, either explicitly, or through the
filesystem implementation of <tt>setattr()</tt>.  Then,  <tt>inode_setattr()</tt>
calls <tt>vmtruncate()</tt>
to set the inode size and unmap the pages mapped beyond the new file
size. After unmapping the pages, the associated filesystem's
<tt>truncate()</tt> operation is called to free the disk blocks associated
with the file.

<p>
According to Nick, this approach has problems:
<p>

<div class="BigQuote">
Big problem with the previous calling sequence: the filesystem is not called
until i_size has already changed.  This means it is not allowed to fail the
call, and also it does not know what the previous i_size was. Also, generic
code calling vmtruncate to truncate allocated blocks in case of error had
no good way to return a meaningful error (or, for example, atomically handle
block deallocation).
</div>

<p>
Nick's new truncate sequence introduces a way to
better communicate error conditions and consolidates the checks 
which most filesystems currently perform individually. The 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/340109/">original intention</a> was to add a
new <tt>truncate()</tt> operation in <tt>struct inode_operations</tt> which
would be called
directly for a truncate operation in <tt>inode_setattr()</tt>.
Christoph Hellwig <a
href="http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=%3c20090706172241.GA26042%40infradead.org%3e">
disagreed</a> with the call sequence, stating that the new truncate
function should be called from notify_sequence, and not from
inode_setattr which is the default implementation for
<tt>inode_operations.setattr</tt>. 
Nick felt that clearing <tt>ATTR_SIZE</tt> before calling generic
<tt>setattr</tt> is not unusual (discussed later), so he decided to
introduce his changes with a flag called <tt>new_truncate</tt> in
<tt>struct inode_operations</tt>, and not using a new truncate
function altogether.  The <tt>new_truncate</tt> flag indicates that the
<tt>truncate()</tt> function in the inode operations handles the new format.
Nick admits that this is a nasty hack when he introduces the variable in
<tt>inode_operations</tt>. However, it will be required until
all filesystems transition to the new truncate sequence. Filesystem code which
does not implement the new convention will automatically initialize
<tt>new_truncate</tt> to zero, indicating that it has not transitioned 
yet.

<p> The <a
href="http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=%3c20090710073230.599337765%40suse.de%3e">first
patch</a> in the patch series introduces new functions to facilitate the
change. <tt>inode_newsize_ok()</tt> performs simple checks to check if
the intended new file size is within limits defined by the filesystem or is
not a swap file:
<p>
<pre>
    int inode_newsize_ok(struct inode *inode, loff_t offset)
</pre>
<p>
These checks are currently done by individual filesystems. Using this
function results in cleanups in individual filesystem code.
<p>
The <tt>truncate_pagecache()</tt> function truncates the inode pages and
unmaps the pages in the range beyond the new filesystem size:
<p>
<pre>
    void truncate_pagecache(struct inode *inode, loff_t old, loff_t new);
</pre>
<p>
<tt>truncate_pagecache()</tt> should ideally be called before the filesystem releases
the data blocks associated with the inode. This way the page cache will
always be in sync with the on-disk format and the filesystem will
not have to deal with situations such as <tt>writepage()</tt> being called for
a page that has had its underlying blocks deallocated. 

<p>
The <tt>vmtruncate()</tt> function is consolidated for NUMA and non-NUMA
architectures in <tt>mm/truncate.c</tt>. However, 
<tt>vmtruncate()</tt> is deprecated. Instead,
<tt>truncate_pagecache()</tt> and <tt>inode_newsize_ok()</tt> introduced in
the first patch should be used.

<p>
The third patch is the main patch of the series which
uses the new truncate operation.  It introduces
<tt>simple_setsize()</tt>,
which performs equivalent of <tt>vmtruncate()</tt>.
<tt>simple_setsize()</tt> is called by
<tt>inode_setattr()</tt> when <tt>ATTR_SIZE</tt> is passed. So filesystems implementing
their own truncate code in setattr must clear <tt>ATTR_SIZE</tt>
before calling the generic <tt>inode_setattr()</tt>. 

<p>
To follow the new standards of the truncate operation, individual
filesystems must implement their own <tt>setsize()</tt> function,
which performs the
file size validation checks, truncates the page cache, and truncates the data
blocks associated with the inode. Filesystems must not trim
off blocks past <tt>i_size</tt> using <tt>vmtruncate()</tt>. Instead,
they must handle the truncate in the filesystem code using
<tt>truncate_pages()</tt>. This creates a
better opportunity to catch errors. The
<tt>inode_operations.new_truncate</tt> and
<tt>inode_operations.truncate</tt> fields will go away once all filesystems
are converted.

<p>
To demonstrate the change, the final patch in the series
modifies the ext2 filesystem to use the new truncate interface. The patch
introduces <tt>ext_setsize()</tt> to set the inode size of the file,
truncate the pagecache, and, finally, trim the data blocks on the
filesystem. If <tt>ATTR_SIZE</tt> is set, <tt>ext2_setattr()</tt>
calls <tt>ext2_setsize()</tt> to
perform the truncate and the <tt>ATTR_SIZE</tt> is unset so that
inode_setattr() does not perform the operations again. 

<p>
The new truncate patchset has gone through a fair share of review and
is pretty likely to get merged. However, it would require the "nasty
hack" until all filesystems have transitioned to the new way of
truncating files, after which the hack will be removed. The patches
are part of the improvements Nick wants to see in the VM layer. Based
on the new truncate patches, Nick posted an <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems/33910">RFC</a>
on how he would
close a race condition in <tt>page_mkwrite</tt> when a file is
truncated beyond the current file size.  Closing races is a good thing, so
expect this work to proceed apace.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I checked the code, the above is true. However neither the fcntl(2) nor the truncate(2) man pages mention this. We must do better!<br>

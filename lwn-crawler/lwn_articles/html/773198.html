           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 30, 2018</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2018-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>
</div>
The BPF virtual machine is the same on all architectures where it is
supported; architecture-specific code takes care of translating BPF to
something the local processor can understand.  So one might be tempted to
think that BPF programs would be portable across architectures but, in many
cases, that turns out not to be true.  During the <a
href="http://vger.kernel.org/lpc-bpf.html">BPF microconference</a> at the
<a href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers
Conference</a>, Alexei Starovoitov (assisted by Yonghong Song, who has done
much of the work described) explained
the problem and the work that has 
been done toward "compile once, run everywhere" BPF.
<p>

Many BPF programs are indeed portable, in that they will load and execute
properly on any type of processor.  Packet-filtering programs, in
particular, usually just work.  But there is a significant class of
exceptions in the form of tracing programs, which are one of the biggest
growth areas for BPF.  Most tracing tools have two components: a user-space
program invoked by the user, and a BPF program that is loaded into the
kernel to filter, acquire, and possibly boil down the needed data.  Both
programs are normally written in&nbsp;C.
<p>
The BPF side of a tracing program may have to dig deeply into the guts of
the 
kernel, and those guts can change significantly from one kernel to the
next.  The offsets of specific fields within structures are a particular
problem; they can differ depending on architecture, kernel configuration
options, and more.  Tracing programs often need to use those offsets to get
the data they are looking for.  If the offsets built into a given BPF
program do not match the current kernel, the program will not produce the
correct results.
<p>
This problem is "solved" now by compiling BPF programs on the fly, just
prior to loading them into the kernel.  To do that, the <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BPF Compiler Collection</a> (BCC)
bundles a 
copy of the Clang compiler, which is a lot of code to haul around — and

<a href="/Articles/773224/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2018/lpc/AlexeiStarovoitov-sm.jpg" alt="[Alexei
Starovoitov]" title="Alexei Starovoitov" class="rthumb"></a>

much of that code has to be linked into the tracing program itself, where
it consumes RAM.  This
toolchain, along with the kernel development headers, must be installed on
the system being traced, a painful task on embedded systems.  Even then,
it's often necessary to paste specific structure definitions into BPF
programs to be able to access the needed fields.
<p>
The proposed solution is to introduce structure-field offset information
into the <a href="/Articles/750695/">BPF Type Format (BTF) section</a>
describing a compiled 
BPF program.  Those offsets are built into BPF programs by the compiler
now; what is needed is a set of pointers to where those offsets are used
and their associated field names; then the libbpf library will be enhanced
to "relocate" those offsets to match the current kernel before a given
program is loaded into the kernel.
<p>
Parts of this problem are hard.  In particular, getting the field-name
information through LLVM's intermediate representation is difficult; there
is "a lot of compiler work" to be done to support this feature.  The
information needed to perform relocation is more readily available from the
<tt>vmlinux</tt> kernel image file on the target system.  Ongoing work
includes converting the data-type information stored in the DWARF format in
the kernel image to BTF, a process that reduces the size of that
information from 120MB to 2MB.
<p>
Offsets to structure fields are not the only problem that needs to be
solved, though.  Imagine a bit of code that looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    #if KERNEL_VERSION == 406
        minrtt = ms.v1;
    #else
        minrtt = ms.v2;
    #endif
</pre>
<p>
The branch that is pruned by the preprocessor never appears in the output,
with the result that the generated BPF code is dependent on the kernel
version.  The planned solution here is to turn the preprocessor variable
into a BPF variable, so that the above code could be written as:
<p>
<pre>
    if (__bpf_kernel_version == 406)
        minrtt = ms.v1;
    else
 	minrtt = ms.v2;
</pre>
<p>
Both paths are now present in the generated BPF code, which will do the right
thing regardless of the kernel version.  Other cases are harder; imagine,
for example, code that is dependent on whether the <tt>REQ_OP_SHIFT</tt>
macro is defined.  Once again, a global variable
(<tt>__bpf_req_op_shift</tt>) is created to delay the decision until run
time and keep all paths present in the generated code.  Things get more
complicated when it comes to types that may not exist at all depending on
something like a configuration variable.  Solutions here include a complex
"fuzzy struct-type matching" mechanism, or just creating a massive file
full of type information (in the BTF format) for a wide range of kernel
versions.
<p>
The problem can be
made arbitrarily complex, though; Jes Sorensen asked whether it would be
possible to handle CPU masks, which are stored on the kernel stack — unless
the system is too large, in which case they are pushed out to heap
storage.  The answer was that some things will just never be possible.
<p>
Other problems include calling static inline functions and preprocessor
macros from BPF programs;
there does not appear to be a better solution than just copying them into
the program at this point.  That will bloat the size of the program, of
course, and getting some of those functions past the BPF verifier could
prove to be a challenge.
<p>
Some related work has to do with adding global variables and read-only data
to BPF programs.  Globals, which are needed to support some of the
techniques described above, can be added without any compiler changes, but
the kernel API to support them still needs to be designed and implemented.
That is also 
true of read-only data, which would be especially useful for the handling
of strings in BPF programs.
<p>
There are clearly a few things to be worked out in this area still, and it
may never be possible to run an arbitrary BPF program on any system.  But
it seems likely that BPF users will see a solution that works for a lot of
the commonly-used tools in the BCC collection, which should make life
easier for a lot of use cases.

Hm. I considered doing kernel-version-independent stuff when I did the CTF work for DTrace for Linux, but came to the conclusion that it was pointless: there is still massive .config-related data-structure variation that is almost certain to cause offsets to vary between distinct kernel releases in any case, so there was hardly anything to gain. I don't see what's changed to make it worthwhile here.<br>
<p>
(One thing I *did* do was make it .config-independent to the extent that if you compile things as a module, or make them built in, the CTF is still placed in the same per-module location (really a CTF file member with a per-module name in the generated CTF archive), so that DTrace programs could reference e.g. ext4`ext4_inode_info and not have to change their scripts if users chose to build ext4 into the kernel.)<br>

The problem with WebAssembly is that it is binary. Binary means unportable and insecure. I would opt into a completely text-based kernel. Being text-based guarantees backward compatibility, portability, extensibility and security.<br>
<p>
I can imagine a micro-kernel where each service is Node.js instance. IPC is done using simple text-based JSON. Kernel modules can be loaded from npm at boot time.<br>
<p>
What about performance? Well you know JITs nowadays can be as fast as C and sometimes they are even faster. So I guess it can be even faster than Linux kernel, right?<br>

<p>
C isn't executed, hence, C-code has no speed (if a compiler is being used). Machine code is executed. As "at the absolutely wrong time" (namely, while a user is waiting for something to happen) compilers generate machine code, there's obviously no reason why machine code generated "just in time" (when the program was compiled) would have an built-in speed difference compared to machine code generated by the "at the wrong time" compiler.<br>
<p>
But that's a pretty meaningless statement: An typical Node.js module depends on each other, typical Node.js module which was at least already planned by the it was written. And a codepath traversing all Node.js code on this planet will take longer to execute that a  functionally equivalent, self-contained program. Not to mention that "at the absolutely wrong time" compiling all Node.js code on this planet will already take a lof of time on its own.<br>
<p>
Hence, outside of doctored microbenchmarks, the "runs even faster" is not going to happen.<br>

      <blockquote>
The problem with WebAssembly is that it is binary. Binary means unportable and insecure. I would opt into a completely text-based kernel.
</blockquote>
The problem with binary protocols over textual ones is not that they are unportable and insecure, not if their properties are properly specified (as eBPF's has been). It is that they are opaque and hard to debug if you're looking at a raw packet dump. This is not usually considered a problem for assembly languages, which are not usually transmitted over the wire (if you want to debug it, you have a disassembler), and if you are throwing it over the network the ubiquity of tcpdump and/or Wireshark and its massive army of packet dissectors means that binary protocols are much less annoying than they used to be too. The only remaining advantage of textual protocols is that they are easy to write by hand... and who the hell writes major web apps by hand into a telnet session? (Or BPF programs, for that matter). Not even people doing early experimentation do any such thing.
<p>
There is a <i>reason</i> the successors to HTTP are all binary protocols. I like textual protocols but in some respects their benefits have declined to irrelevance. The tradeoff wheel has turned once more.

I did not marked it explicitly, but there should be a big &lt;sarcasm&gt; tag in my comment.<br>
<p>
No, I don't think it is a good idea to have micro-kernel consisting of Node.js instances. My comment was intended to have humorous meaning. I just took a few misconceptions I heard from different people and mixed them all together in a single absurd comment.<br>
<p>
One example of such misconception is "text based protocols/formats have inherently better backward compatibility than binary". The source of the misconception is comparing key/value-based text formats with sequence-based binary formats. People attribute the distinction to the difference between text and binary, instead of between key/value-based and sequence-based. One can formulate another statement like "key/value-based formats have inherently better backward compatibility than sequence-based". Well this is only partially true. This holds true for only one type of change of the format: adding a new key and assigning a default value if it is not present. Other changes (deleting key, renaming key) break backward-compatibility of key/value-based formats.<br>
<p>
Above I've refused only one misconception, but there are many others I used in my comment.<br>
<p>
I completely agree with what you said. Thank you for thoughtful answer to my comment. My comment was not intended to be taken seriously. Sorry if my sarcasm was not apparent at first.<br>

I thought it might be sarcastic, but except for node.js I've heard exactly the same thing from many bearded old fart sysadmins used to typing stuff into telnet sessions. Of course what they actually want is a textual *interpretation* of the output (and the ability to put textual input in and have it translated the other way), but that's rarely what they ask for. :)<br>

<p>
That confusion is because they're often the same in practice. Key/value means a parser is required, a parser is where the compatibility comes from. Protocols are often binary *because* designers want to just copy from/to memory with as little parsing as possible (just some sanity checks), for instance for performance reasons.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Other changes (deleting key, renaming key) break backward-compatibility of key/value-based formats.</font><br>
<p>
That's why newer versions rarely ever delete any key and only after a long period of deprecation and warnings and why would anyone rename a key?<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; One can formulate another statement like "key/value-based formats have inherently better backward compatibility than sequence-based". Well this is only partially true.</font><br>

Partially true... in theory.<br>

Early versions of HTML5 even attempted to spread the misspelling to the new feature &lt;a rel=noreferer&gt;, for consistency with the HTTP header it refer(r)ed to. But then someone pointed out the DOM API for Referer was already called document.referrer, so HTML5 could switch to &lt;a rel=noreferrer&gt; without feeling guilty about being the first to break consistency.<br>

Well, people who program "web apps" write HTTP "by hand", just like all the other code. Text is also fairly easily generated with simple facilities: It's possible to write a fairly comprehensive HTTP-library in less then 600 lines of code.<br>

Actually, PDF is a 7-bit ASCII format. Yes, there might be some binary content embedded, especially if you use compression and/or encryption, but like PostScript it is a language that you could write in a normal text editor.<br>
<p>
Fun fact: In the national German computer science contest (Bundeswettbewerb Informatik) we once got a solution for an exercise, where some fractal image should be computed. The code was entirely written in PostScript. It could be send to a PostScript printer to compute and print the image. There was no restriction to the programming language. The code had to be documented and the language should be somewhat reasonable.<br>

LLVM bitcode, in addition to the lack of portability between LLVM releases etc, is a hell of a lot further from the machine than (e)BPF is. BPF is really quite remarkably easy to JIT down to x86_64 and most other modern machine languages, and the interpreter core is pretty small and easy to read as well, as such things go: most opcodes translate directly into a little bit of obvious C acting directly on the variables that hold the register contents. (Far more work goes into the verifier, which of course is necessary even, perhaps especially, if you're JITting).<br>
<p>
One sign that BPF is nicely designed: as someone who's been hand-writing BPF recently (rewriting a code generator that used to generate output for a much more, ah, *verbose* intermediate representation with many more opcodes), whenever I found I needed a particular opcode, it was there, and nothing I didn't need was there except the weird historical stuff to do packet content inspection.<br>
<p>
I like BPF. I thought I'd hate it, because all such things are generally hateful, but it's not hateful at all: it has no horrible irregularities that make you scream and most of the annoying limits as a general-purpose-but-verified language (stack size, etc, lack of even constrained loops, etc) are being raised or fixed as we speak. If any language takes over its world like BPF is doing, I'm happy it's BPF that's doing so.<br>

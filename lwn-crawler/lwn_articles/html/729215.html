           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 31, 2017</br>
           </div>
Changes to core-kernel subsystems take time but, even so, one can only
imagine that Tejun Heo never expected the process of fixing the
control-group interface to take more than five years.  Disagreements over
the design of the new control-group interface have delayed its adoption;
even though most of the code has been in the kernel for some time, not all
controllers work with it.  It would now appear, however, that agreement has
been reached on an important final piece, which is currently on track to be
merged for the 4.14 development cycle.
<p>
When Heo first <a href="/Articles/484251/">raised the issue</a> of fixing
the control-group interface in 2012, he identified what he saw as two key
problems: the ability to create multiple control-group hierarchies and
allowing a control group to contain both processes and other control
groups.  Both interface features complicated the implementation of
controllers, especially in cases where multiple controllers need to be able
to cooperate with each other.  His proposal was that the new ("V2")
control-group API should dispense with these features.
<p>
Fast-forward to 2017, and those changes have been made.  The V2 interface
supports a 
single control-group hierarchy, and it requires that processes only appear
in the leaf nodes of that hierarchy.  Getting there took quite a bit of
discussion and negotiation, and most users have made their peace with the
new world order.  This migration <a href="/Articles/697366/">ran into a
snag</a> when the time came to update the CPU controller, though, with the
result that there still is no CPU controller for the V2 interface.
<p>
The core problem is the "no internal processes" rule, combined with another
V2 constraint that was added a bit later: all of the threads of any given
process must be placed in 
the same control group.  For most of the controllers in the system, it
makes little sense to place a process's threads in different parts of the
hierarchy; many resources are best managed at the process level.
But CPU scheduling is different.  It is entirely sensible (and
useful) to allow a thread to compete with a subgroup full of other threads
for the CPU, and applying different scheduling constraints to different
threads in the same process is also useful.  The inability of the V2
interface to handle this use case has led to disagreements that have taken
years to resolve.
<p>
Heo has made various proposals to address this problem, culminating in the
"<a href="/Articles/715051/">thread mode" concept</a> posted in February.
There were still some disagreements at that time that prevented thread mode
from being merged, but it would appear that those have, finally, been
worked out.
<p>
<h4>Thread mode for 4.14</h4>
<p>
The thread-mode concept found in <a href="/Articles/729219/">the latest
patch set</a> follows the same lines as the version described in
February.  In current kernels, all control groups adhere to the "no
internal processes" and "all of a process's threads are grouped together"
rules.  Control groups following these rules still exist in the new scheme;
indeed, that remains the default mode.  Such groups have been deemed
"domain groups".
<p>
A domain group can be changed to a "threaded group" by writing the string
"<tt>threaded</tt>" to its <tt>cgroup.type</tt> control file.  The group
must be empty for this change to be allowed.  Threaded groups differ from
domain groups in a few ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Any subgroups of a threaded group must also be threaded groups.
     Interestingly, new groups under a threaded group start out as domain
     groups in an "invalid" and unusable state.  The only thing that can be
     done with them (other than removal) is to switch them to the threaded
     mode.
<p>
<li> The peers of a threaded group must also be threaded groups.  In other
     words, a domain group that contains a threaded group can only contain
     threaded groups.  An attempt to create a domain group inside a group
     that contains threaded groups will yield a group in the "invalid"
     state. 
<p>
<li> The "no internal processes" rule does not apply within threaded
     groups; a threaded control group can contain both processes and other
     threaded control groups.
<p>
<li> The requirement that all of a process's threads must be in the same
     group is also relaxed.  Those threads may now be placed in multiple
     groups, but all of those groups must be threaded and a part of the
     same hierarchy.
</ul>
<p>
As an example, consider the hierarchy from the February article shown on
the right.  Here, "A" and "B" are traditional domain groups, while "T1" and
"T2" are a pair of threaded control groups.  T1 violates the "no internal

	<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/cgtm2.png" width=302 height=232
	alt="[Control-group hierarchy]" vspace=3 align="right">

processes" rule because it contains both T2 and the process P3, but, since
it's a threaded group, that configuration is allowed.  It is also
legal for P2 and P3 to be threads of the same process.  These aspects of
the hierarchy are not possible without the new threaded group concept.
<p>
A resource controller that is not aware of threaded groups will not see
them at all.  Consider the memory controller, for example, which is hard to
implement in a rational way in the threaded mode.  That controller will see
P2 and P3 as being contained within the domain group&nbsp;B; the internal
hierarchy will be hidden from it.  The rules against internal processes and
distributed threads still exist for such a controller.
<p>
On the other hand, a controller that is able to handle threaded groups can
indicate that fact to the kernel, and it will have the full hierarchy
available to it.  These controllers must have a sensible concept for what
it means to have processes competing against groups for resources, and they
must be able to apply different policies to threads belonging to the same
process.  Some resources are not amenable to control in that mode, but
others work well.  The patch enabled threaded mode for the PID and
perf_events controllers, neither of which needed changes beyond setting the
requisite flag.  Interestingly, the CPU controller has not yet been enabled
with the new interface; that is a bigger job that may be waiting for the
current patch set to be merged.
<p>
One significant difference from the February patch set is the establishment
of a special rule for the root control group.  That group was already
unique in that it was exempt from the "no internal processes" rule; it is
also uniquely able to contain both threaded and domain groups.  This
exemption was added to allow performance-sensitive threaded groups to
be placed as high as possible in the hierarchy.  Placing tasks lower in the
hierarchy adds a bit of overhead that, while small, is unwelcome to those
trying to squeeze every drop of performance out of their systems.
<p>
Having finally managed to address all of the objections, Heo <a
href="/Articles/729220/">announced</a> on July&nbsp;21 that the threaded
mode had been queued for merging in 4.14.  Without the CPU controller this
merging doesn't quite mark the end of the V2 conversion, but that end is
now at least in sight.
<p>
<h4>Bypass mode</h4>
<p>
Of course, the "completion" of the V2 interface does not mean that the work
is actually done; few things in the kernel are ever truly finished.
Developers are already thinking about ways in which this interface could be
extended to accommodate other use cases.  One such extension is the "<a
href="/Articles/728621/">bypass mode</a>" proposed by Waiman Long.
<p>
Resource distribution in control groups is a top-down matter: a controller
can only be enabled for a group if it's enabled in that group's parent.
If one looks at the simple control-group hierarchy to the right, for

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/cgroup-hier.png" width=212 height=122 alt="[Control
group hierarchy]" hspace=3 vspace=3 border=0 align="right">

example, it is only possible to enable any given controller in group&nbsp;C
if it has already been enabled in group&nbsp;A.  That is not usually a
problem but, Long says, there may be situations where the requirement to
enable the controller in group&nbsp;A gets in the way.  The above-mentioned
issue with scheduler performance maybe one such case: enabling the CPU
controller in&nbsp;A will result in a small performance penalty for
group&nbsp;C. 
<p>
To enable more flexibility in how controllers see the hierarchy, Long's
patch set adds a new "bypass" mode.  This mode disables a controller in the
group for which it is set, but still allows the controller to be enabled
further down the hierarchy.  So, in this case, the controller could be set
to bypass group&nbsp;A, but to be enabled in group&nbsp;C.  For all
practical purposes, bypass mode would simply hide group&nbsp;A from the
bypassed controller, changing its view of the hierarchy.
<p>
Heo's <a href="/Articles/729222/">response</a> to this patch set is that
bypass mode "<q>continues to be an interesting idea</q>", but the
changes are intrusive and he would like to see some serious use cases
first.  Long <a href="/Articles/729223/">described some uses</a> in further
detail, but the conversation has not progressed much beyond that point.  So
while something like bypass mode may eventually become a part of the
control-group API, it is probably not likely to happen in the immediate
future.
<p>
In a more general sense, though, the control-group API finally appears to
be getting close to the point that was envisioned over five years ago when
this effort began.  The new API is near to its intended functionality, and
the major design disagreements seem to have been worked out.  There will,
doubtless, be plenty of room for new features (and arguments associated
with them) for a long time, and there is still the issue of someday phasing
out the V1 interface.  But control-group development is reaching an
important milestone and, with luck, things will be a bit calmer for a while.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

With the new thread mode patch, cgroup controllers are now divided into 2 groups - domain controllers and non-domain (threaded) controllers. The no internal process constraint is also relaxed that internal processes are not allowed in non-leaf cgroup when domain controllers are enabled in the child cgroups. IOW, internal processes are now permitted if only non-domain controllers are enabled in the children. Thread mode now becomes a special case as non-domain controllers can't be enabled anyway.<br>

Not to mention that there are still many fundamental problems with the no-internal-process constraint. In particular, if you want to implement a container runtime with cgroupv2 it's quite complicated to actually use cgroupv2 with the constraints. Also the existence of the united hierarchy sounds like a good idea -- until you realise that if you want to use cgroups as process labeling (for example with the name=... cgroups) you _by definition_ want them to be separate hierarchies. So cgroupv2 just removes this feature, because nobody other than systemd should ever care about labeling processes.<br>

      The docs are quiet because this distinction isn't into the mainline, but the article does say what the difference is.  Non-domain controllers can have thread groups in them; domain controllers cannot.

Thanks, I was confused on the difference between 'domain/non-domain groups' vs 'domain/non-domain controllers'. The article clearly defines the first one and for controllers, I can deduce that those controllers (like PID and perf_events) which can handle threaded or non-domain groups are non-domain controllers. Is that right?<br>

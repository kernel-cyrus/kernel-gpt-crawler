<p>
The kernel execution (kexec) subsystem allows a running
kernel to switch to a different kernel.  This allows for faster booting, as
the system firmware and bootloader are bypassed, but it can also be
used to produce crash dumps using <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt">Kdump</a>.
However, as Matthew Garret explained on his blog, kexec could be used to <a
href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/28746.html">circumvent UEFI secure boot
restrictions</a>, which led him to <a
href="/Articles/514985/">propose</a> a way to disable kexec on secure boot
systems. That was not 
terribly popular, but a more recent patch set would provide a path for
kexec to only boot <i>signed</i> kernels, which would solve the problem
Garrett was trying to address, without completely disabling the facility. 
</p>

<p>
The kexec subsystem consists of the 
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kexec_load.2.html"><tt>kexec_load()</tt></a> 
system call that loads  a new kernel into memory, which can then be booted
using the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/reboot.2.html"><tt>reboot()</tt></a>
system call.  There is also a <a
href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/kexec"><tt>kexec</tt> command</a> that
will
both load the new kernel and boot it, without entering the system firmware
(e.g. BIOS or UEFI) and 
bootloader.  

<p>
But the UEFI firmware is what enforces the secure boot restrictions.
Garrett was concerned that a Linux kernel could be used to boot an
unsigned (and malicious) Windows operating system by way of kexec because
it circumvents secure boot.  That
might lead 
Microsoft to blacklist the keys used to sign <i>Linux</i> bootloaders,
which would make it difficult to boot Linux on commodity hardware.  Using
kexec that way could affect secure-booted Linux systems too, of course,
though Microsoft might not be so quick to revoke keys under those
circumstances. 
</p>

<p>
In any case, 
Garrett eventually
 <a href="/Articles/523367/">removed</a> the
kexec-disabling portion of his patch set (though he strongly suggested that
distributions should still disable kexec if they are going to support
secure boot).  Those patches have not been merged (yet?).  More recently,
Vivek Goyal has put together a <a 
href="/Articles/601213/">patch set</a> that is intended to address
Garrett's secure boot concerns, but would also protect systems that only
allow loading signed kernel modules.  As Garrett showed in his blog post, that
restriction can be trivially bypassed by executing a new kernel that simply
alters
the <tt>sig_enforce</tt> sysfs parameter in the original kernel's memory and then jumps back to that
original kernel.
</p>

<p>
Goyal's patches start down the path toward being able to restrict kexec so
that it will only load signed code.  To that end, this patch set defines a
new system call:
<pre>
    long kexec_file_load(int kernel_fd, int initrd_fd,
			 const char *cmdline_ptr, unsigned long cmdline_len,
                         unsigned long flags);
</pre>
It will load the kernel executable from the <tt>kernel_fd</tt> file
descriptor and will associate the "initial ramdisk" (initrd) from the
<tt>initrd_fd</tt> descriptor.  It will also associate the kernel command
line passed as <tt>cmdline_ptr</tt> and <tt>cmdline_len</tt>.  The initrd
and command-line information will be used when the kernel is actually
booted.  This contrasts with the existing kexec system call:
<pre>
    long kexec_load(unsigned long entry, unsigned long nr_segments,
                    struct kexec_segment *segments, unsigned long flags);
</pre>
It expects to get <tt>segments</tt> that have been parsed out of a kernel
binary in user space and to just blindly load them into memory.  As can be
seen, <tt>kexec_file_load()</tt> puts the kernel in the loop so that it can
(eventually) verify what is being loaded and executed.
</p>

<p>
As one of the segments that get loaded, 
there is a standalone executable object, called "purgatory", that runs
between the two 
kernels.   At <tt>reboot()</tt> time, the "exiting" kernel jumps to the
purgatory code. 
Its main function is to check the SHA-256 hashes of the other segments
that were loaded.  If those have not been corrupted, booting can proceed.
The purgatory code will copy some memory to a backup region and do
some architecture-specific setup, then jump to the new kernel.
</p>

<p>
The purgatory code currently lives in <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/kexec/">kexec-tools</a>,
but if the kernel is to take responsibility for setting up the segments
from the kernel binary and initrd, it will need a purgatory of its own.  Goyal's patch
set <a href="/Articles/603414/">adds that code</a> for x86 to
<tt>arch/x86/purgatory/</tt>.  

<p>
Goyal also <a href="/Articles/603417/">copied
code from <tt>crypto/sha256_generic.c</tt></a> into the purgatory
directory.  It's clear he would rather simply just use the code directly
from the <tt>crypto/</tt> directory, but could not find a way to do so:
<div class="BigQuote">
  I could not
#include sha256_generic.c file here as some of the function signature
[required a] little tweaking. Original functions work with crypto API but
these ones don't
<p>
So instead of doing #include on sha256_generic.c I just copied relevant
portions of code into arch/x86/purgatory/sha256.c. Now we shouldn't have to
touch this code at all. Do let me know if there are better ways to handle
it.
</div>
</p>

<p>
While the patch set is at version 3 (earlier versions: <a
href="/Articles/582711/">v2</a>, <a href="/Articles/574400/">v1</a>), it is
still a "request for comment" (RFC) patch.  There are various unfinished
pieces, with signature verification topping the list.  So far, the new
facility is only available for the x86_64 architecture and bzImage kernel
images.  Adding other architectures and support for the ELF kernel format
still remain to be done.  There is also a need for some documentation,
including a <tt>man</tt> page. 
</p>

<p>
Goyal did <a href="/Articles/603428/">explain</a> his vision for how the
signature verification will work.  It is based on David Howells's work on
verifying the signatures for loadable kernel modules.  Essentially, the
signature will be verified when <tt>kexec_load_file()</tt> is called.  That
is also when the SHA-256 hashes for each segment are calculated and stored
in the purgatory segment.
So, all purgatory has to do is verify the hashes (which it already does to
avoid running corrupted code) to ensure that only a properly signed kernel
will be executed.
</p>

<p>
There have been plenty of comments on each version of the patch set, but
most of those on v3 were technical suggestions for improving the code.  So
far, there have been no complaints about the overall idea, which means we
may well see the ability to require cryptographic signatures on the kernels
passed to kexec added as a feature sometime in the next year—hopefully
sooner than that.  It would be a nice feature to have when Garrett's secure
boot patches get merged.

True, at present users can still add their own keys to *some* UEFI key databases or disable SecureBoot on *some* UEFI systems (some UEFI systems do not allow one or both, either by design (e.g. ARM) or by bug/accident).<br>
<p>
How long local users will still be allowed to subvert Windows SecureBoot on UEFI PCs, we shall see. I hope I'm proven to be an unnecessarily alarmist skeptic, however the number of systems afflicted by DRM/locked-down-computing seems to keep steadily increasing over the decades, rather than decreasing.<br>

You aren't doing any "subverting" if you turn it off or change the keys. Windows 8 will not boot until reinstalled and then it won't be in secure mode. So it isn't subverted. It just won't work.<br>
<p>
I don't deny that there are some motherboard makers that really truly SUCK at software quality control and won't listen to bug reports about non-Windows operating systems. I just don't like the word "subvert" here.<br>

What?  Windows won't boot if you disable SecureBoot?  That doesn't sound right ... why wouldn't it just warn you you're not in "secure" mode, disable some DRM shite, and be done with it?  I never heard before that it required a REINSTALL!<br>
<p>
...and I have a fairly recent system which booted Windows once or twice before I bulldozed it and installed Linux.  And it booted with not just Secure Boot disabled but with the legacy BIOS support enabled.  What systems have you seen that didn't allow this?<br>

I don't buy systems that have 2 or less DIMM slots; I wouldn't buy a motherboard that doesn't allow UEFI manipulation. Yet my computer today has only 2 of its slots populated, and I might trash the motherboard before I upgrade the memory. I have no plans to ever use the... I have no idea, 38 SW/HW/JOBD SATA ports the beast has. But some people would, apparently, and there is a huge market for hackable systems.<br>
<p>
That set-top boxes aren't today easily SW hackable is largely irrelevant; not being able to add memory or an additional drive largely makes them not legitimate targets for playing with. Except outside of some circle-jerk geekathon type scenario.<br>

I am having a difficulty where kexec_file_load() always returns -ENOMEM, when kexec_load() (via kexec-tools) always works. The files pointed to are the same, so it isn't that the file is huge.<br>

The patch went in with a differn't type signature that the article describes. The cmdline_len and cmdline_ptr options have been switched.<br>
<p>
    long kexec_file_load(int kernel_fd, int initrd_fd,<br>
			 unsigned long cmdline_len, const char *cmdline_ptr,<br>
                         unsigned long flags);<br>

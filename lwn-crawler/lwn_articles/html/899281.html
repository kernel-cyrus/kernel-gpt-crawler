           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceIndex/#Linux_Security_Summit_North_America-2022">LSS NA</a>
</div>
<p>
On the first day of the 2022 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/linux-security-summit-north-america/">Linux
Security Summit North America</a> (LSSNA) in Austin, Texas, Stéphane Graber
and Christian Brauner gave a presentation on using system-call interception
for container security purposes.  The idea is to allow unprivileged
containers, those without elevated privileges on the host, to still
accomplish their tasks, some of which require privileges.  A fair amount of
work has been done to make this 
viable, but there is still more to do.
</p>

<p>
Graber started things off by saying that he works for Canonical on the <a
href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/">LXD container manager
project</a>, while Brauner works for Microsoft in various areas of Linux
security.  Graber said that there are two types of containers these days,
privileged and unprivileged, "one is bad, one is OK".  He noted that privileged
containers are "unfortunately what everyone uses" for Docker containers, Kubernetes, and
so on.
</p>

<h4>Unprivileged containers</h4>

<p>
LXD defaults to using unprivileged containers; <a
href="/Articles/532593/">user namespaces</a> are "the primary barrier for
security" in those containers.  Privileged containers have had a constant
whack-a-mole game using Linux Security Modules (LSMs), <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt>
filters</a>, and other mechanisms to try to close holes that allow processes inside the
containers to gain privileges on the host. He and others want to move to a
world where everyone uses unprivileged containers; "privileged containers
should not be a thing", he said. 
</p>

<a href="/Articles/899407/">

</a>

<p>
But there are a number of things that do not work in unprivileged
containers.  They are effectively running as some random regular user on
the host system; "we don't allow random users on our systems to do a lot of
things".  Using other types of namespaces and adding new ones has allowed
unprivileged containers to work around some of these restrictions, but
there is a limit to how far that can be pushed.  There is not a lot of
appetite for adding lots more namespace types to the kernel.
</p>

<p>
So the LXD project started looking at what could be done with
<tt>seccomp()</tt> filters and, in particular, with <a
href="/Articles/756233/">system call interception in user space</a>.   It
can provide a way to allow the container to do things that require privileges,
but do so in a controlled way that is mediated by the container manager.
</p>

<p>
Brauner said that <tt>seccomp()</tt> conveniently sits on the
system-call-entry path well before the system-call-specific code is
invoked.   There are some 
system calls where the container should be able to succeed in making the
call even though it lacks the required privileges.  For example, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mknod.2.html"><tt>mknod()</tt></a>
should be allowed for certain kinds of device nodes, such as
<tt>/dev/zero</tt>, <tt>/dev/null</tt>, <tt>/dev/console</tt>, and so on.
These are "pretty boring device nodes", but the kernel's permission model
either allows creating any arbitrary device node or no device nodes.
</p>

<p>
Unprivileged processes (or containers) should not be able to create
<tt>/dev/kmem</tt> or some random block device, for example, as that could
lead to a compromise of the host.  But there are a few simple device nodes that
containers require, which are currently bind-mounted from the host.  There
is no good reason  not to just allow them to be created in the containers directly.
</p>

<p>
One could imagine some kind of allowlist in the kernel that specified which
device nodes do not require privileges to create, Brauner said.  That is
"kind of hacky", so other solutions were tried.  Along the way, he discovered
that there already is a limited version of an allowlist; the "<a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html#whiteouts-and-opaque-directories">whiteouts</a>"
used by the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html">Overlay
filesystem</a> to mark files that have been deleted in an upper overlay are actually
character device nodes with a special device number (0/0).  Those can be
created without extra privileges. That weakens
the argument against an allowlist for <tt>mknod()</tt> in the kernel, he
said, but that route was not pursued.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/899408/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/lssna-brauner-graber2-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5
align="right" alt="[Christian Brauner]"
title="Christian Brauner" width=239 height=280>
</a>

<p>
Something else that was tried was allowing unprivileged processes to create
device nodes, but not to be able to open them.  That broke pretty much all of the
container runtimes, Brauner said.  It is
a deeply held assumption that if a process can create a device node, it can
open it.  So it turns out that allowing the creation of  device nodes that
cannot be opened  "is not a great idea".
</p>

<p>
But all of that was focused on a single system call; there is a need to
support other "safe" uses of system calls.  So the idea of system-call
interception was born at the <a
href="http://blog.linuxplumbersconf.org/2017/">2017 Linux Plumbers
Conference</a> (LPC), Brauner 
thinks.  A mechanism that can inspect the arguments to the system call
could, for example, deny <tt>mknod()</tt> calls for block devices and for
character device numbers that are not on the approved list.  Rather than
some static policy in the kernel about what to allow or deny, the decision
could be delegated to a user-space process.
</p>

<p>
So <tt>seccomp()</tt> was extended to support exactly that, he said.  A new
type of filter was added to get a user-space notification when the system
call is made; the container manager can then obtain a file descriptor that
it can 
poll for system-call events. When the manager is notified of a system call, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>
commands can be used to retrieve the arguments to the call, which can be
used to make a decision.  That decision is returned to the kernel by
writing to the file descriptor.
</p>

<p>
A <tt>seccomp()</tt> filter can only tell the kernel to continue the call,
fail the call with a specific error code that gets returned to the caller, or return success.
If the container manager thinks the system call should succeed for an
unprivileged container, it cannot
just tell the kernel to go ahead and perform the call since the calling
task does not have the proper privileges.
So the container manager has to
emulate the system call by performing the action as if the task did have
the proper permissions.  Once it does so, and makes the result available to
the container, it can tell the kernel to return success to the task.
</p>

<p>
He asked attendees if they could think of a security problem that might
arise from this scheme; someone was quick to mention  <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">time-of-check-to-time-of-use</a>
(TOCTTOU) concerns.  Brauner said that <tt>mknod()</tt> is a "pretty boring
system call because it only has integer arguments".  Other system calls,
with pointer arguments allow the container manager to be tricked by a
caller that changes the argument 
at the address <i>after</i> the manager checks that it is "safe".
<tt>seccomp()</tt> filters are written in classic BPF, rather than <a
href="/Articles/740157/">extended BPF</a> (eBPF), which means that they
cannot dereference pointers.  So, in order to inspect an argument passed by
reference, the manager would need to read the data directly from the
process's memory (using the address as an offset into
<tt>/proc/PID/mem</tt>).  That "works" but it suffers from TOCTTOU races.
</p>

<p>
Once the <tt>seccomp()</tt> notify mechanism was added, people immediately
started thinking up ways to create a security framework that, for example,
looked at the <tt>pathname</tt> argument for the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html"><tt>open()</tt></a> system
call to decide whether to allow or deny access to a particular file.  It
could then tell the kernel to continue the system call if the file name was
not problematic.  The process being
filtered would presumably already have the privileges needed to open the
file, but could be denied if the filtering process decided it should not be
able to access the file.  The process could simply rewrite the argument
after the check was done, though, and the kernel will happily open the file.
</p>

<p>
That limits the usefulness of being able to continue system calls from
filters.  It can only be done if the ultimate security boundary, the kernel
itself, will deny the action anyway, as it would for <tt>mknod()</tt> from
an unprivileged container.  That means that the <tt>seccomp()</tt>
notification mechanism cannot be used to implement a security policy for,
say, privileged containers. In order to warn people away from doing so,
Brauner said that the put a <a 
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.18.8/source/include/uapi/linux/seccomp.h#L80">comment
in <tt>seccomp.h</tt></a> describing the problems. 
</p>

<p>
Generally, <tt>seccomp()</tt> system-call interception requires a trusted, privileged
process on the host to supervise the calls.  For example, in the case of
nested unprivileged containers, having the container manager in the outer
container supervise the calls from the inner one is pretty uninteresting,
he said.  That is something to keep in mind as uses for this facility are designed.
</p>

<h4>Target system calls</h4>

<p>
Graber took over at that point to describe the system calls they have been
working on intercepting, which is quite a different list than what they started with
back in Los Angeles at LPC.  That is not surprising, since even at that
time they knew some on the list would be hard or impossible to handle. The
current list is <tt>mknod()</tt>, as already
mentioned, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setxattr.2.html"><tt>setxattr()</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt></a>,
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html"><tt>sched_setscheduler()</tt></a>, 
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html"><tt>mount()</tt></a>,
and <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sysinfo.2.html"><tt>sysinfo()</tt></a>.
Those are all implemented for LXD; other projects have been using what
has been done in LXD, and may be working on intercepting other system calls.
</p>

<p>
Intercepting <tt>mknod()</tt>/<tt>mknodat()</tt> allows LXD to run tools
like <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap">debootstrap</a>
in a unprivileged container.  That means distribution images can be built
in those containers.  Another reason that those calls needed to be
intercepted is to allow containers to create whiteouts for overlayfs.  That
allows Docker to unpack its layers into an unprivileged container, for example.
Graber said the he considers the interception of <tt>mknod()</tt> with the
restrictions LXD has in place to be "relatively safe".  He is not aware of
any problems, but it is not enabled in LXD containers by default.  It is
one that the project thinks most containers can enable, however.
</p>

<p>
<tt>setxattr()</tt> provides a way to mark a deleted directory in
overlayfs, so it needed to be supported in LXD as well.  There is an
allowlist of extended attributes (xattrs) that can be set from unprivileged
containers.  Obviously, only some attributes can be allowed, since setting
those in certain namespaces, such as the "security.*" xattrs, "would be
extremely bad", Graber said.
</p>

<p>
Brauner then described the situation for the <tt>mount()</tt> call.  In the
<tt>mknod()</tt> case, he said, there was no need to "play any specific
games with the privilege level or security level" in the
supervisor/manager.  It could simply access the mount namespace of the
container and create the device node within it.  Things are not so simple
with <tt>mount()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
When performing a <tt>mount()</tt> on behalf of the container, there are a
number of security attributes that need to be handled, such as Linux
capabilities, LSM profiles, user and group IDs, various namespaces (e.g. mount,
PID,  or user), and so on.  The emulated call in the manager needs to
assume the identity of the requesting process in the container so that no
extra privileges come along for the ride when the mount is performed. "It
becomes really tricky to get right", he said.
</p>

<p>
Given that, he asked, "why intercept the <tt>mount()</tt> system call?"
There are cases where the host is providing a filesystem to the container
that the container manager can vouch for.  Under those limited
circumstances, allowing the filesystem to be mounted is useful.  You cannot
allow arbitrary mounts inside the container, however,  
due to the possibility of malicious filesystem images. 
</p>

<p>
The container manager can emulate the <tt>mount()</tt> call, so it can
avoid the TOCTTOU races that could occur since most of the arguments are
pointers.  The <tt>mount()</tt> system call is also problematic because it
is a "terrible multiplexer" that can perform a wide variety of actions
beyond just mounting a block-based filesystem: bind-mount, mount a
pseudo-filesystem, change mount or superblock attributes, and more.
Intercepting the system call is useful, for now, though he some ideas on a
"delegated mounting" feature for the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer that
may be a better solution in the future.
</p>

<p>
Graber said that LXD allows the mount inside the container to automatically
have user and group ID remapping applied.  It also has a mode where it will
intercept the mount and turn it into the equivalent mount using <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html">Filesystem
in User Space</a> (FUSE). That makes it "pretty safe" because the
filesystem is not actually mounted directly through the kernel but is
instead being handled by a user-space process inside the container.
</p>

<p>
Brauner said that he has implemented a proof-of-concept for <tt>bpf()</tt>
interception, which uses the <a href="/Articles/794707/">pidfd work</a>
that he has done over the last few years.  There is a problem with
emulating system calls that return file descriptors, such as
<tt>open()</tt> and <tt>bpf()</tt>, because the file descriptor needs to be
shared with the requesting process.  The pidfd API allows descriptors to be
safely injected into another task.  LXD restricts the programs that the
containers can run; one that it allows will enable the container to further
restrict access to its devices.
</p>

<p>
Graber said that the <tt>sched_setscheduler()</tt> interception is not one
that LXD considers to be safe; "I find it dodgy", Brauner said.  But,
Graber said, Android uses the call a lot, so when running Android in an
unprivileged container it can be enabled.  That could lead to various kinds
of problems, however, so it should be used with care—if at all.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>sysinfo()</tt> interception was added recently to further support a
feature from <a
href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxcfs/introduction/">LXCFS</a>, which
can report things like available memory based on the control-group limits
of the container, rather than the system-wide numbers.  That works well,
but multiple tools use <tt>sysinfo()</tt> to get values to report, so they
still would show the host-wide values.  By intercepting the call, the uptime, amount of
memory, and so on can be reported correctly inside the container.
</p>

<p>
Graber then demonstrated various interceptions in an LXD container.  As one
example, he showed the <tt>sysinfo()</tt> interception.  He started the
container with a limit of 256MB of memory and, inside the container, the
<tt>free</tt> command indeed showed that.  That is because LXCFS was
mounted on <tt>/proc/meminfo</tt> so that it could intercept reads of that
file.  But, running a binary that consulted <tt>sysinfo()</tt> reported the
16GB on his laptop instead.  Restarting the container with the interception
cleared that little problem right up. 
</p>

<p>
All of the information used by the <tt>sysinfo()</tt> interception comes from what LXCFS
has already gathered, but not reporting through the system call led to multiple
bug reports, Brauner said.  For example, Java looks at the available memory
via <tt>sysinfo()</tt> and will pre-allocate its memory based on that.  In
addition, Graber said, the <tt>free</tt> in Alpine Linux uses (or used)
<tt>sysinfo()</tt> leading to bug reports regarding the LXD control-group limits.
</p>

<h4>Future</h4>

<p>
They closed with some thoughts on future plans.  Brauner said that he would
like to explore adding at least some limited support for eBPF to
<tt>seccomp()</tt> filters. For a long time, new system calls with pointer
arguments were rejected because <tt>seccomp()</tt> cannot dereference
pointers.  That has changed, so that multiplexers, like <a
href="/Articles/810414/">io_uring</a>, and the new <a
href="/Articles/830666/">extensible system call scheme</a> were not
blocked.  But that leads to another problem.
</p>

<p>
The GNU C library (glibc) wanted to switch to using the <a
href="/Articles/792628/"><tt>clone3()</tt></a> system call, but ran afoul
of the <tt>seccomp()</tt> filters installed for many containers.  Those did
not allow <tt>clone3()</tt> at all because all of the arguments are behind
a pointer so they cannot be inspected.  The older <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><tt>clone()</tt></a>
system call has a <tt>flags</tt> argument that is passed directly, thus can
be used to decide whether the system call should proceed.
So Brauner would like to see some mechanism for <a
href="/Articles/822256/">inspecting arguments that are behind pointers</a>,
and some kind of <a href="/Articles/857228/">limited eBPF support</a> would fit the bill.  In the past,
<tt>seccomp()</tt> maintainer Kees Cook has generally been <a
href="/Articles/799557/">opposed</a> to doing so, but Cook was not present
at LSSNA this year.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, Graber said that some kind of limited support for
kernel-module loading might be something on the horizon.  That idea scares
many people, with good reason, but it would be strictly limited
interception of <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/init_module.2.html"><tt>init_module()</tt>/<tt>finit_module()</tt></a>.
It would not allow the container to actually load a module; instead the container
would pass in what it wants to load, and if the module passes some checks, the
container manager would load the host's version of that module.  One of the
applications for that is for firewalls in a container that need various
network modules.  Right now, there is a list of modules that get loaded at
container startup time, but it would be nice to have on-demand module
loading, he said.
</p>

<p>
One interesting thing about <tt>seccomp()</tt> filters is that the interception is
done even before the system-call table is consulted, which means that new
system calls can be created
entirely in user space.  The new system call
would simply be defined for an unused system-call number, which would get
intercepted by the filter to call the new code.  That could be used to
prototype new system calls.  He has not seen anyone actually do so, yet,
but it is a possibility.

Seccomp notify can also be used in kubernetes containers. Rootless containers are using it to increase network performance in about 7 times, to name one example.<br>
<p>
I worked on adding support for this into runc (the low level container runtime used by containerd and docker by default) and blogged about it here, in case someone is interested (with an example seccomp agent that can be used as a building block to build other actions in the agent): <br>
<p>

<p>
Also, we contributed support for seccomp notify in the OCI runtime-spec, so other runtimes like crun and youki have implemented it too :-)<br>

There is a notable difference on the terminology what &quot;privileged&quot; means, depending on the container engine:<br>
<p>
Privileged Docker: All capabilities, direct Hardware access. Basically close to no isolation. Attackers can even load kernel modules etc.<br>
<p>
Privileged LXC: No use of user namespaces, BUT still use of other namespace types, Seccomp, AppArmor etc.<br>
<p>
One could say that the security level of a &quot;privileged&quot; LXC container equals that of an ordinary Docker container.<br>
<p>
BTW It is about to get time that docker uses user namespaces by default, just like LXC and Podman do. User namespaces have been around since 2013 in the mainline kernel...<br>

has anyone actually tried to implement these things in the kernel? seems to me like nobody&#x27;s even going to be trying, like it&#x27;s been pre-decided we&#x27;re just running down this path of &quot;offload everything contentious to userspace, to make it even more contentious in the future, as to how to solve these new problems we created by doing that meanwhile&quot;... at vpsFree.cz, we run our own kernel patches, which modify sysinfo() acording to cgroups, allow mknod, etc. in production, it&#x27;s the best way to do it - otherwise you&#x27;ll keep running into these nesting issues, etc. - yes, yes, we can argue about how exactly these things should be implemented, but as we can see, the original approach of leaving the hard things for later in the hope it&#x27;ll make everything much more universal, doesn&#x27;t work so well (see the whole cgroups v1 debacle as whole)<br>
<p>
srsly what&#x27;s so hard about it - other than a few developers&#x27; attitude towards such changes...<br>
<p>
I think this all comes down to people being ok with calling this half-baked thing we have in kernel &quot;containers&quot;. Privileged or not, it still has a long way to go to be called that, IMHO.<br>

At some point someone is going to have to bite the bullet on the whole TOCTOU issue and pointers to syscalls. To really fix it you have to add the step of marshalling the actual data from userspace into the kernel so that the code checking it and the kernel itself are looking at the same data.<br>
<p>
But then you have stuff like execve() which wants to copy command-line arguments directly from one process space to another without loading all the data into the kernel. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a generic way to on the one hand allow the syscall to be validated first, and not make an additional copy of the data. I think we&#x27;ll have to accept that if you want allow additional checking of syscalls by BPFs that a little extra code will need to be added that marshalls all the arguments into kernel memory and then calls the BPF and the real syscall afterwards.<br>

Somebody here mentioned an idea to generate the marshalling layer based on the CTF description. Might be a good idea to just bit the bullet and do this.<br>
<p>
Moreover, we can even allowlist a few performance-crucial syscalls (like &#x27;open&#x27;) from marshalling. But all the thousands of ioctls can definitely be piped through that marshalling layer without any real impact.<br>

<p>
As for the marshalling layer itself, in the limit you can just do what FUSE does for unprivileged ioctls. Of course that involves repeated roundtrips so is not exactly efficient, but with a proper (CTF-driven?) description, you could marshal most things straight away with no roundtrips at all.<br>
<p>
(The problem is TOCTTOU while the marshalling is going on. You can reduce the probability of that by rescanning everything after the first marshal and comparing it with what was marshalled, but if the attacker keeps changing the source that just turns the problem into a DoS attack.)<br>

Isn&#x27;t the attacker also the originator of the request? If so I don&#x27;t see the scope for DoS - just rescan and if something has changed under your feet just fail the request.<br>

The marshalling layer obviously has to be written to be safe in case of data races. It&#x27;s going to be tricky, but it needs to be done only once.<br>
<p>
Then the kernel (and all the other layers) can just use the sanitized representation. Detecting attempted races can be a nice additional intrusion detection feature, but not a requirement.<br>

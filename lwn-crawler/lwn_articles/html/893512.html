<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
The <a href="/Articles/849538/">folio project</a> is not yet two years old,
but it has already resulted in 
significant changes to the kernel's memory-management and filesystem
layers.  While much work has been done, quite a bit remains.  In the
opening plenary session at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a>, Matthew Wilcox provided
an update on the folio transition and led a discussion on the work that
remains to be done.
<p>
Wilcox began with an overview of the folio work, a more complete
description of which can be found in the above-linked article.
In short, a folio is a way of representing a set of
physically contiguous base pages.  It is a response to a longstanding
confusion in the memory-management subsystem, wherein a "page" can refer
either to a base page or a larger <a href="/Articles/619514/">compound
page</a>.  Adding a new term 
disambiguates the term "page" and simplifies many memory-management
interfaces.
<p>
Beyond terminology, there is another motivation for the folio work.  The
kernel really needs to manage memory in larger chunks than 4KB base pages.
There are millions of those pages even on a typical laptop; that is a lot of
pages to manage and a pain to deal with in general, causing the waste of a
lot of time and energy.  Better interfaces are needed to facilitate
management of larger units, though; folios are meant to be that better
interface.
<p>
<h4>Current status</h4>
<p>
A folio is represented by <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.18-rc5/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L226"><tt>struct
folio</tt></a>; it is essentially an alias 
for the head page of a compound page.  Wilcox has been adding uses of
folios into the kernel over the course of the last year; this project has
come a long way but is not yet complete.
<p>
One open question concerns when the kernel should allocate large folios — those
containing more than one base page.  Only the readahead code allocates them
now; the filesystem write path still does everything in terms of base

<a href="/Articles/893613/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/MatthewWilcox-sm.png" alt="[Matthew Wilcox]"
title="Matthew Wilcox" class="rthumb"></a>

pages.  If writes are done to large folios that were brought in via readahead,
they will see and use those large folios.  Appending to a file will
always use base pages, though.  There are almost certainly advantages
to using large folios in the write path, but it will be necessary to figure
out what the criteria for creating them will be.
<p>
Meanwhile, the process of converting filesystem code to folios continues.
Wilcox encouraged filesystem developers to look for infrastructure that
already exists when possible rather than reimplementing it themselves.  He
pointed out the support layer for network filesystems that was recently
rewritten by David Howells.  It would also be good for filesystems to move
away from the old buffer-head APIs and use the relatively new iomap
infrastructure whenever possible.
<p>
Ted Ts'o said that more guidance on conversion to iomap would be useful.
Moving a filesystem over can be a daunting task, he said, but developers
should understand that it can be done incrementally.  For example, a
filesystem's read path can be converted while leaving the write path
unchanged for now.  This can be useful, Wilcox agreed, especially since
iomap is still missing some capabilities, such a support for features like
fs-verity or compression.  That lack is often more problematic on the write
side than on the read side.
<p>
<h4>API complaints</h4>
<p>
Josef Bacik said that one particularly annoying problem for Btrfs is that
the memory-management subsystem's page locks must be taken before
filesystem-level locks.  That makes it hard at the filesystem level, and
gets in the way of needed features like range locking.  He would love to
see this issue addressed, but knows that it will not be easy.  Wilcox
admitted that this problem had not been on his radar at all, but it is
something he will have to look into.  Chris Mason noted that the problem is
not specific to Btrfs; other filesystems have encountered similar
difficulties over the years.
<p>
Bacik also said that page reclaim driven by memory management can also be
problematic, and the interface to filesystems is not great.  It would be
good, he said, to be able to distinguish requests like "please free
whatever memory you can now" from requests to free specific pages.  Wilcox
said that much of the kernel's reclaim machinery may not be relevant
anymore; it was designed in the days when filesystems were far less
capable than they are now.  Good filesystems now are already keeping all of
their drives busy 
doing writeback; there is really little more that they can do if the
memory-management code wants them to free specific pages.  Perhaps the
memory-management subsystem should simply stop requesting the reclaim of
pages that reach the end of the least-recently-used (LRU) list, he suggested.
<p>
There is a possible way to test that idea, he said; perhaps filesystems
should simply remove their implementation of the <tt>writepage()</tt>
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.18-rc5/source/include/linux/fs.h#L340">address-space
operation</a>.  Howells said that he had done that in the AFS 
filesystem, with seemingly good results.  Some other filesystems, including
9P, will be harder though.
<p>
The problem there, Ts'o said, is that the memory-management subsystem is
trying to solve multiple problems at the same time.  When responding to
global memory pressure, it just needs some pages to be freed and will not
be that picky about where they happen to be.  Once control groups enter the
picture, though, it becomes necessary to relieve memory pressure within a
specific container; that requires reclaim to be more focused.  When
compaction is being performed to create huge pages, it comes down to
freeing specific pages.  These cases need to be thought about separately.
Removing <tt>writepage()</tt> may help with the global problem, but the
need to free specific pages doesn't go away.
<p>
Wilcox expressed a hope that widespread use of large folios will help with
the compaction problem at least, since there should be far less
fragmentation in the first place.  In some benchmark runs he has seen the
length of the LRU lists reduced by a factor of 1000, which is "just
insane".
<p>
On the other hand, he said, one potential problem resulting from large
folios may be a form of write amplification.  Dirty state is tracked at the
folio level, not at the level of the individual base pages contained
therein; when the time comes to write out data, the entire folio will be
written even if only one byte has changed.  This will increase the write
bandwidth used by the system, but should also help to reduce fragmentation
on copy-on-write filesystems.  He said that he didn't expect "serious
trouble" though.
<p>
Others were not so sure.  Mason pointed out that Jens Axboe has been putting
in a considerable amount of effort to make it easy to perform small operations
in io_uring.  This work is specifically motivated by write-bandwidth
concerns.  Axboe added that bandwidth is indeed a concern, but is more of a
problem on the read side than with writes.  There was some 
discussion on how big the problem actually is; one developer pointed out
that the situation will vary depending on the filesystem in use.  For a
network filesystem with high latency, writing too much data may be better
than doing multiple round trips with the server.  There was a general
agreement that better metrics are needed to understand the situation
properly. 
<p>
<h4>Longer-term goals</h4>
<p>
Moving on, Wilcox said that he is still in the process of converting the
address-space operations provided by filesystems to folios; there are still
a couple of them to be done.  In many cases, this "conversion" is a matter
of changing a function prototype to accept a pointer to
<tt>struct&nbsp;folio</tt> rather than to
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>, then adding a line like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct page *p = (struct page *) folio;
</pre>
<p>
This pattern is, he said, "a bad code smell"; it is a sign that the code in
question needs further work.  The plan is to eventually convert every
filesystem to folios — but not necessarily to the point of using
<i>large</i> folios.
<p>
There is an underlying motivation behind this work: he hopes to eventually
remove one of the big union members from <tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>, once
filesystems are no longer using that structure.  Memory-management
developers, he said, want to put a lot more information into
<tt>struct&nbsp;page</tt>, but there are strong reasons to not make that
structure any larger.  So, instead, he would like to shrink it; perhaps,
someday, it can be reduced (from 64&nbsp;bytes) to a single pointer.  Even
better, that could be one pointer per folio, rather than one structure per
page, allowing the kernel to get 
back the 1.6% of memory that is currently used to hold <tt>page</tt>
structures.
<p>
That, he said, will allow companies to save money on memory and use it to
send their developers to more conferences.
<p>
Howells said that it would be good to eventually get rid of the
<tt>write_begin()</tt> and <tt>write_end()</tt> address-space operations;
Wilcox agreed, saying that they were originally designed for the needs of
ext3, and later filesystems have had to fit into that model.  Goldwyn
Rodrigues pointed out that iomap is not currently using those
callbacks.
<p>
Kent Overstreet complained about the practice of passing around structures
full of callbacks,
which he described as an "old model" of API design.  Bacik said, though,
that he doesn't really care about the API as long as it lets him focus on Btrfs
and not have to worry about how memory management works.  Wilcox answered that
much of his work has been aimed at making filesystems easier to write in
general, and he hopes that folios help in that regard.  Nothing in
filesystems should have to care about pages, he said, except for, possibly,
the page-fault path.
<p>
Overstreet, though, objected that developers should care more about such
things.  Many of the kernel's internal interfaces have aged badly;
developers should be talking about what the pain points are and how to
remove them.  Bacik said that the kernel needs developers who care about
these interfaces specifically; he, personally, is on the edge of burnout
and can't take on other tasks.  So he is happy about the folio work; there
is an owner who cares about the interface and is working to make it better.
He said that this is hard, thankless work, and thanked Wilcox for
taking it on.
<p>
Wilcox closed the session by acknowledging that the folio work is imposing
costs on many other developers, and said that he feels the weight of that
cost.  Developers have made the costs clear to him, some more politely than
others.  He thanked Bacik for his comments, saying the he is glad that
somebody, at least, sees the benefit of this work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I appreciate this! Several developers came up to me at this conference and said some variant of &quot;I didn&#x27;t think the benefits outweighed the costs but now I realise I was wrong&quot;. And that&#x27;s also gratifying, although it means I&#x27;m not doing a good enough job explaining why my patches are beneficial.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Perhaps the memory-management subsystem should simply stop requesting the reclaim of pages that reach the end of the least-recently-used (LRU) list, he suggested.</font><br>
<p>
It has defacto stopped already.<br>
<p>
When too many dirty pages come off the LRU, reclaim nudges the flushers and throttles itself to their progress. The -&gt;writepage call is still there on paper, but it&#x27;s been neutered by conditionals that rarely trigger in practice. It&#x27;s also only there for the global case, never called for cgroup reclaim. (Cgroup-aware flushers are conceivable, but in practice the global flushers and per-cgroup dirty throttling have been working well.)<br>
<p>
Migration/compaction is not a problem, either. All major filesystems have -&gt;migratepage callbacks that can move dirty pages around just fine--no writeback needed. The -&gt;writepage call is just there as a fallback for niche/legacy filesystems.<br>
<p>
XFS hasn&#x27;t had a -&gt;writepage callback since last summer. All filesystems with -&gt;writepages and -&gt;migratepage callbacks should just remove theirs, too.<br>

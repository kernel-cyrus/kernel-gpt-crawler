           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 4, 2019</br>

On NUMA systems with a lot of CPUs, it is common to assign parts of the
workload to different subsets of the available processors.  This
partitioning can improve performance while reducing the ability of jobs to
interfere with each other.  The partitioning mechanisms available on
current kernels might just do too good a job in some situations, though,
leaving some CPUs idle while others are overutilized.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190626224718.21973-1-subhra.mazumdar@oracle.com/">soft
affinity patch set</a> from Subhra Mazumdar is an attempt to improve
performance by making that partitioning more porous.
<p>
In current kernels,
a process can be restricted to a specific set of CPUs with either the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setaffinity.2.html"><tt>sched_setaffinity()</tt></a>
system call or the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html">cpuset</a>
mechanism.  Either way, any process so restricted will only be able to run
on the specified CPUs regardless of the state of the system as a whole.  Even if
the other CPUs in the system are idle, they will be unavailable to any
process that has been restricted not to run on them.  That is normally the
behavior that is wanted; a system administrator who has partitioned a
system in this way probably has some other use in mind for those CPUs.
<p>
But what if the administrator would rather relax the partitioning in cases
where the fenced-off CPUs are idle and going to waste?  The only
alternative currently is to not partition the system at all and let
processes roam across all CPUs.  One problem with that approach, beyond
losing the isolation between jobs, is that NUMA locality can be lost,
resulting in reduced performance even with more CPUs available.  In theory
the <a href="/Articles/488709/">AutoNUMA</a> balancing code in the kernel
should address that problem by 
migrating processes and their memory to the same node, but Mazumdar notes
that it doesn't seem to work properly when memory is spread out across the
system.  Its reaction time is also said to be too slow, and the cost of the
page scanning required is high.
<p>
So Mazumdar has taken a different approach with a patch set that tries to
resolve the issue by creating a concept of "soft affinity".  It starts by
adding a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int sched_setaffinity2(pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize, cpu_set_t *mask,
			   int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The first three arguments mirror <tt>sched_setaffinity()</tt>: they identify
the process to be modified and provide a mask of CPUs on which that process
can run.  The <tt>flags</tt> argument is new, though.  If it is set to
<tt>SCHED_HARD_AFFINITY</tt>, then this call will behave just like
<tt>sched_setaffinity()</tt>, absolutely restricting the processes to the
CPUs in the given <tt>mask</tt>.  <tt>SCHED_SOFT_AFFINITY</tt>, instead,
sets a new "soft affinity" mask (which must be a subset of the hard mask) and
thereby requests the new behavior.
<p>

Said behavior is to treat the soft-affinity CPU mask the same as old-style
"hard" affinity most of the time: the process will run only on the CPUs
listed in that mask.  If, however, those CPUs are busy and other CPUs in
the process's hard-affinity mask are close to idle, the process will be
allowed to run on the idle CPUs as well.  That allows the workload to
spread out across the system, but only when CPUs are underutilized.
<p>

In other words, this patch creates two levels of CPU affinity masks, where
in current kernels there is only one.  Both masks default to containing all
CPUs in the system (as the hard mask does in current kernels).  The
behavior of the hard mask is unchanged, but the new soft mask can be used
to further restrict processes to a smaller group of CPUs; that
further restriction can be relaxed by the kernel at times when CPUs found
only in the hard mask are idle.

<p>
The decision on whether to allow a constrained
process to "break out" of its soft-affinity mask is based on two new sysctl
knobs, called <tt>sched_allowed</tt> and <tt>sched_preferred</tt>.  If the
ratio of <tt>sched_allowed</tt> to <tt>sched_preferred</tt> is greater than
the ratio of the CPU utilization of the soft-affinity CPUs to that of
another CPU, 
then that other CPU will be considered for placing a task.  The default is
to set <tt>sched_allowed</tt> to 100 and <tt>sched_preferred</tt> to one,
meaning that a CPU outside of the soft-affinity set must be only 1% as
loaded as the CPUs inside the set before a soft-affinity process will be
moved there.  That ratio is a pretty high bar; the target CPU would have to
be idle indeed to pass this test.  In sites where this mechanism is used,
the administrator would probably want to tune those parameters differently.
<p>
One question not addressed within the patch set is what happens when a
process that has been moved out of the soft-affinity CPUs inevitably raises
the utilization of the CPU it is moved to.  The soft-affinity decision is
made whenever a process wakes up, so the expected behavior would seem to be
that the process would run on the outside CPU until it sleeps again.  If
that sleep is relatively short, it seems likely that the process would be
moved again on its next wakeup.
<p>
Benchmarks provided with the patch set show performance increases of up to
about 7% for some workloads, and regressions in some others.  Most of the
improvements are relatively small, though, and the data seems noisy.
Reviewers might also look closely at Mazumdar's claim that the AutoNUMA
balancing does not do a good enough job and, in particular, whether it
would be better to improve that code rather than adding a new mechanism and
a new set of scheduler tunables.
<p>
So it is not clear that the case for this work has yet been made
convincingly, something that would need to happen before this work would be
considered for merging.  Work along these lines seems destined to continue,
though.  The pressure to get as much work as possible out of every CPU
seems unlikely to decrease, and even a relatively small performance
improvement is worth a fair amount when it is replicated across a large
data center.  Soft affinity may or may not be an answer to this problem, but it
is indicative of the needs that are driving kernel development for those
environments.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Sounds like a hard sell.<br>
On paper having a soft cpu affinity might sound useful, but in my experience, in most cases where people want to pin their tasks, they don't want any heuristics which might cause strange side-effects. Predicting when an application will break out of its soft affinity and how this will affect such a fine tuned system might cause more trouble than it is worth<br>

Isn't relocating memory &amp; changing NUMA masks already be part of this process?<br>
<p>
Presumably hot-plugging is already migrating memory prior to the CPU being removed, (or so I assume; without the on-cpu memory controller, the EC-DRAM will blank). Or is RAM kept live during a hot-plug?<br>

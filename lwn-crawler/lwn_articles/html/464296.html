Google's Paul Turner started his session by saying that scheduler testing
is a hard problem.  Results are hard to reproduce, especially when users
cannot share their workloads, and remote debugging is impossible.  There
are a lot of possible machine topologies, expanding the problem space.  The
lack of testability makes developers reluctant to make significant changes
to the scheduler; it is too easy to break somebody else's workload and not
find out until it is too late.  But there are a lot of changes that need to
be made, especially (for Paul, at least) in the areas of load balancing and
power management.  What is to be done?
<p>
Load balancing is a concern at Google; having idle CPUs when there are
processes waiting for a chance to run on other CPUs is not an ideal
situation.  It is not too hard to come up with some metrics to describe the
"goodness" of the scheduler's load balancing decisions; it is just a matter
at looking at the state of the system and determining if a job on one CPU
should have been placed on a different one.  The problem is that this
computation is sufficiently hard that it can't be done in real time;
otherwise there would be no real load balancing problem.
<p>
Enter LinSched, a scheduler simulator for
Linux.  This tool was <a href="/Articles/409680/">released</a> in 2010,
but, unfortunately, "it was awful." 
The idea was good, but the implementation was not.  So the folks at Google
have reworked the whole thing, ending up with something that looks a lot
like user-mode Linux, but which is aimed at scheduler testing.  There are
no hooks placed in the scheduler itself, so it is easy to change the
scheduler or apply patches before testing.  It is fast, and has support for
most scheduler features.  All of the instrumentation and support has been
pushed off into a new "linsched" virtual architecture.
<p>
The next step is to come up with useful workloads.  A number of Google
workloads were observed to the point where they could come up with patterns
for 500 different situations.  With the new linsched, they can quickly test
all of these workloads with a variety of system topologies; the whole thing
can be run under a debugger, so it is easy to stop and examine decisions
that go wrong.  Finding the "wrong" decisions is a matter of calculating
the load-balancing score for a reference scheduler, then looking for places
where a test scheduler generates worse scores.  This tool has already been
used to find (and fix) workload-specific regressions
resulting from some 
mainline scheduler patches.
<p>
They would like to release this code and push it into the kernel's
<tt>tools/</tt> directory.  That could have even happened for the 3.2
cycle, but the kernel.org outage slowed things down somewhat.  Interest in
the tool among developers has been high, and in academic communities as
well.
<p>
It is safe to say that this news was warmly received in the room at the
kernel summit.  Having a test tool like this gives developers a much higher
degree of confidence when they are making changes to the scheduler.  So
Ingo Molnar welcomed the tool, asking only that the perf infrastructure be
used as much as possible.  He would like to see the workload descriptions
merged as well so that everything needed to run scheduler tests will be
present in the mainline kernel.  Scheduler problems, he said, traditionally
take a long time to find; having a tool like this would allow the scheduler
to be improved much more aggressively.  He could see a day when no
scheduler patches would be accepted before they had passed this set of
tests. 
<p>
A number of other things could be added to the tool in the future -
simulating preemption latency, for example.  It didn't take developers long
to say that they would like to have a similar tool for other parts of the
kernel - the memory management subsystem came to mind.  That is a rather
harder problem - that subsystem is rather more complex than the scheduler.
But even being able to exhaustively test just the scheduler is a big step
in the right direction.

<p>
Just a quick clarification: Paul's scheduler analysis and simulation tool <b>already</b> uses 'perf sched record' to collect data, and the analysis and simulation capabilities overlaps with (and eclipse) what 'perf sched' is about so what I asked for was for Paul's tool to <b>become</b> 'perf sched' in essence.
<p>
What we don't want is for the old 'perf sched' to stay around dangling.

      Not a single word about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Fuck_Scheduler">BFS</a> ? Does that mean that the upstream scheduler is now superior in all regards compared to the BFS ?

      The BFS author is not interested in creating a general-purpose scheduler, and he is not interested in working with the development community.  It is not surprising that his work is not on the agenda at a meeting like this.

BFS was announced in 2009, that's ages ago at kernel development time scales. Mainline scheduler developers already analyzed and discussed it back in those days, made some improvements to CFS and moved on. It's simply not relevant anymore.<br>
<p>
BFS wasn't "superior in all regards", don't expect that from the mainline scheduler either. Every heuristic algorithm will be better in some cases and worse in others.<br>

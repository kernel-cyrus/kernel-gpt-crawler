<div class="FeatureByline">

           </div>
The <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/damon/">DAMON</a>
subsystem, which entered the 
kernel during the 5.15 release cycle, uses various heuristics to determine
which pages of memory are in active use.  Since the beginning, the intent
has been to use this information to influence memory management.  The 6.0
kernel contains another step in this direction, giving DAMON the ability to
actively reorder pages on the kernel's least-recently-used (LRU) lists.
<p>
The kernel's memory-management developers would like nothing better than
the ability to know which pages of memory will be needed in the near
future; the kernel could then make sure that those pages were resident in
RAM.  Unfortunately, current hardware is unable to provide that
information, so the memory-management code must make guesses instead.
Usually, the best guess is that pages that have been used in the recent
past are likely to be used again soon, while those that have gone untouched
for some time are probably not needed.
<p>
<h4>LRU lists</h4>
<p>
This approach works well, but there is still a problem: there are limits to
how closely the kernel can track the usage of each page.  Making a note of
every access would slow the system to a crawl, so something else must be
done.  The LRU lists are one way in which the memory-management subsystem
tries to answer this question in an efficient way.
<p>

<div class="tlr">
The less-simplified view is that there is a pair of LRU lists for each
memory zone, and for each memory control group as well.  The core idea
remains the same, though.
</div>

In a simplified view, there are two LRU lists in the system, called the
"active" and "inactive" lists.  Pages in normal use are put onto the head
of the active list.  Over time, they will move down the list as other pages
are added, though some events can promote a given page back to the head.
Pages that reach the tail of the active list are relatively likely to have gone
unused in the recent past, but the association is approximate.

<p>
Occasionally, the kernel will pull a set of pages off the tail of the
active list and place them, instead, at the head of the inactive list.
When this happens, the pages are "deactivated", meaning that they are
marked in the page tables as "not present".  Should some process try to
access such a page, a soft page fault will result; the kernel will then
observe that the page is still in use and
move it back to the active list.  Pages that remain on the inactive
list, instead, will find their way to the tail, where they will be
reclaimed when the kernel needs memory for other uses.
<p>
The LRU lists are, thus, a key part of the mechanism that decides which
pages stay in RAM and which are reclaimed.  Despite their name, though,
these lists are at best a rough approximation of which pages have been
least (or most) recently used.  The description might be better given as
"least recently noticed to be used" instead.  If there were a better
mechanism for understanding which pages are truly in heavy use, it should
be possible to use that information to improve on the current LRU lists.
<p>
<h4>Reordering the lists</h4>
<p>
DAMON ("Data Access MONitor") is meant to be that mechanism.  Through some
clever algorithms (described in <a href="/Articles/812707/">this
article</a>), DAMON tries to 
create a clearer picture of actual memory usage while, at the same time,
limiting its own CPU usage.  DAMON is designed to be efficient enough to use
on production systems while being accurate enough to improve
memory-management decisions.
<p>
The 5.16 kernel saw the addition of DAMOS ("DAMON operation schemes"),
which adds a rule-based mechanism that can cause actions to be taken
whenever specific criteria are met.  For example, DAMOS could be configured
to pass a region that has not been accessed in the last <i>N</i> seconds to
the equivalent of an <tt><a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html">madvise(MADV_COLD)</a></tt>
call.  Various other options are available; they are all described in
detail in <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/damon/usage.html"><tt>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/damon/usage.rst</tt></a>.
<p>
The work merged for 6.0 adds two new operations to DAMOS: <tt>lru_prio</tt>
and <tt>lru_deprio</tt>.  The first will cause the indicated pages to be
moved to the head of the active list, making them the last pages that the
kernel will try to deactivate or reclaim; the second, instead, will
deactivate the given 
pages, causing them to be moved to the inactive lists.  With this change,
in other words, DAMOS is reaching deep into the memory-management
subsystem, using its (hopefully) superior information to make the ordering
of the LRU lists closer to actual usage.  This sorting could be especially
useful if the system comes under sudden memory pressure and has to start
reclaiming memory quickly.
<p>
Author SeongJae Park calls this mechanism "proactive LRU-list sorting" or
PLRUS.  When properly tuned, he claimed in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220613192301.8817-1-sj@kernel.org/">the patch
series cover letter</a>, this mechanism can yield some nice results: "<q>In
short, PLRUS achieves 10% memory PSI (some) reduction, 14% major page
faults reduction, and 3.74% speedup under memory pressure</q>".  The term
"PSI (some)" here refers to the <a href="/Articles/759781/">pressure-stall
information</a> produced by the kernel, which is a measure of how much
processes are being delayed waiting for memory.
<p>
The "when properly tuned" caveat is important, though; DAMOS has a complex
set of parameters to describe action thresholds and to limit how much CPU
time is used by DAMOS itself.  Adjusting those parameters can result in
significant changes to how the core memory-management subsystem goes about
its work.  DAMOS offers a lot of flexibility to a full-time administrator
who understands how memory management works and who is able to accurately
measure the effects of changes.  It also makes it easy to completely wreck
a system's performance.
<p>
To aid administrators who do not have the time or skills to come up with an
optimal DAMOS tuning for their workload, Park also added a new kernel
module called <tt>damon_lru_sort</tt>.  It uses DAMOS to perform proactive
LRU-list sorting under a set of "<q>conservative</q>" parameters that are
meant to safely improve performance while minimizing overhead.  This module
will make using the LRU-list sorting feature easier, but it still has a
significant set of tuning knobs; <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/damon/lru_sort.html">the
documentation</a> describes them all.
<p>
This mechanism is aimed at a similar problem to that addressed by the <a
href="/Articles/894859/">multi-generational LRU</a> work, which currently
seems on track to be merged in 6.1.  The multi-generational LRU, too, tries
to create a more accurate picture of which pages are in active use so that
better page-replacement decisions can be made.  There are a number of open
questions about how the movement of pages between the generations should be
handled; there is talk of allowing the loading of BPF programs to control
those decisions, but DAMOS might be able to help as well.  The integration
between the two mechanisms does not currently exist, but could be a good
thing to add.
<p>
The advent of this type of ability to tweak memory management is,
obviously, a sign that better performance is always desirable.  It is also,
perhaps, an indication that creating a memory-management subsystem that
performs optimally for all workloads is beyond our current capabilities.
Kernel developers tend to prefer not to add new configuration knobs on the
theory that the kernel should be able to configure itself.  Here, though,
new knobs are being added in large numbers.  Some problems are, it seems,
still too hard for the kernel to solve without help.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

In a review of the hardware prefetch control registers that some architectures offer, I pointed to DAMON suggesting its statistics to be elegible to drive the prefetch control for a somewhat heuristic/scientific method rather than the trial-and-error method apparently currently used for these knobs, I don&#x27;t know if there is something to it, but I hope I&#x27;m not all wrong.<br>

<p>
This is wrong. Pages moved to inactive LRU lists are never marked "not present" in process page tables and page faults never happen on such pages. <br>
<p>
Pages in the inactive lists get promoted back to the active lists if the page scan done by the reclaim subsystem finds out that the "accessed bit" for those pages was set since the last scan.<br>

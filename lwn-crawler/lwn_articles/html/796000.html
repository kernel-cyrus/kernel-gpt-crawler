           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 13, 2019</br>
           </div>
Technologies like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_direct_memory_access">RDMA</a>  benefit from the ability to map file-backed pages
into memory.  This benefit extends to persistent-memory devices, where the
backing store for the file can be mapped directly without the need to go
through the kernel's page cache.  There is a fundamental conflict, though,
between mapping a file's backing store directly and letting the filesystem
code modify that file's on-disk layout, especially when the mapping is held
in place for a long time (as RDMA is wont to do).  The problem seems
intractable, but there may yet be a solution in the form of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190809225833.6657-1-ira.weiny@intel.com/">this
patch set</a> (marked "V1,000,002") from Ira Weiny.
<p>

The problems raised by the intersection of mapping a file (via
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>), persistent memory, and layout changes by the
filesystem were the topic of <a href="/Articles/787636/">a contentious
session</a> at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management
Summit.  The core question can be reduced to this: what should happen if
one process calls <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/truncate.2.html">truncate()</a></tt>
while another has an active <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> mapping that pins
some or all of that
file's pages?  If the filesystem actually truncates the file while leaving
the pages mapped, data corruption will certainly ensue.  The options
discussed in the session were to either fail the <tt>truncate()</tt> call
or to revoke the 
mapping, causing the process that mapped the pages to receive a
<tt>SIGBUS</tt> signal if it tries to access them afterward.  There were
passionate proponents for both options, and no conclusion was reached.
<p>
Weiny's new patch set resolves the question by causing an operation like
<tt>truncate()</tt> to fail if long-term mappings exist on the file in
question.  But it also requires user space to jump through some hoops
before such mappings can be created in the first place.  This approach
comes from the conclusion that, in the real world, there is no rational use
case where somebody might want to truncate a file that has been pinned into
place for use with RDMA, so there is no reason to make that operation
work.  There is ample reason, though, for preventing filesystem corruption
and for informing an application that gets into such a situation that it
has done something wrong.

<h4>Layout leases</h4>
<p>
The bulk of the patch set, though, is a recognition that the creation of
long-term mapped kernel-mapped pages on persistent storage is not something
that should be done lightly.  Any user-space process that wants to set up
such a mapping first has to convince the kernel that the associated issues
have been thought about.  That involves extending the existing lease
mechanism in the kernel.
<p>
The <tt>F_SETLEASE</tt> command for <tt><a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl()</a></tt>
allows a process to obtain a "lease" on a file.  Leases will not prevent
other processes from carrying out most operations, but they will lead to
the leaseholder receiving a notification (in the form of a signal) when
another process is about to make a change to a file.  The leaseholder then
has a fixed amount of time to perform any necessary cleanup and remove its
lease before the change is allowed to proceed.  Leases, thus, do not
guarantee exclusive access to a file, but they do give the leaseholder a
window in which to prepare for and cope with any independent changes.
<p>
Inside the kernel, there is a concept of a "layout lease" that is not
exposed to user space.  Layout leases are used with <a
href="http://www.pnfs.com/">pNFS</a> to arbitrate access with respect to
operations 
that can change the on-disk layout of a file.  The first step in Weiny's
patch set is to make the <tt>F_LAYOUT</tt> lease type available to user
space as well.  A process that is mapping a file on persistent storage into
kernel memory could use this type of lease to do the right thing when an
independent operation changes the layout of a file.  The patch set modifies
the XFS and ext4 filesystems to break layout leases before performing a
layout-changing operation in order to support this mode of operation.
<p>
For the intended RDMA use case, though, the "right thing" — unmapping the
file and letting the operation proceed — is not really an option.  The
memory in question is, almost certainly, under the control of a network
interface for DMA operations, and unmapping it would be disruptive at
best.  So the second patch in the series adds a new <tt>F_EXCLUSIVE</tt>
flag to indicate a lease that cannot be broken.  A holder of such a lease
need not worry about handling signals or coping with independent changes;
any operation that would cause that to happen — <tt>truncate()</tt>, for example
— will instead fail with an
<tt>ETXTBSY</tt> error.
<p>
The final step is to change <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> to require the
existence of an exclusive layout lease before any pages can be mapped with
the <tt>FOLL_LONGTERM</tt> flag (which indicates that the mapping is
expected to be held for a long period of time).  Applications that need to
create such mappings will thus need to be changed to obtain the exclusive
lease first.  That might be seen as an ABI change except for the fact that,
until the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190809225833.6657-20-ira.weiny@intel.com/">final
patch</a> in this series, such mappings have not been allowed at all.
<p>
It's worth noting that the application need not continue to hold the lease
after mapping the file; indeed, it need not keep the file open at all.
While an exclusive layout lease does exist, no attempt to change the layout
of the file will succeed.  In the absence of the lease, layout changes will
still fail if they involve any pages that have been pinned with
<tt>get_user_pages()</tt>.  So it may still be possible to call
<tt>truncate()</tt> on a file with long-term pinned pages, but only as long
as there is no layout lease in place and the operation does not affect
those pages.  This behavior fits the intended use case: registration of a
file on persistent-memory storage with the kernel for RDMA operation.

<p>
<h4>Accounting and the future</h4>
<p>
The remaining patches in this series are concerned with keeping track of
what is going on.  Should this code be merged, it is surely only a matter
of time until some user complains about being unable to truncate a file and
wondering just what is blocking the operation.  Some new files added to
<tt>/proc</tt> will provide information about which files have pages pinned
and who is responsible for them.
<p>
Given the heat that has surrounded this problem for years, the response to
this patch set has been relatively muted.  Dave Chinner has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190809235231.GC7777@dread.disaster.area/">expressed
some reservations</a> regarding the semantics of the newly user-visible
layout leases, but he seems to be more concerned with nailing down the
exact behavior than with the idea as a whole.  Nobody has argued that the
overall idea will not work.  So it seems that the
proposed solution might just be good enough to eventually find its way
upstream.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

ETXTBSY is a seriously weird choice as error here as that specifically refers to exectuable files whose text segment (ie, the code segment) must not be modified ATM as a process is executing this file and the kernel thus needs to be able to load the correct code from the file whenever needed.<br>

The file in question isn't being used as backing store for the code of a running process, IOW, the error is unrelated. Judging from a quick read, there isn't really anything better already defined. It could perhaps return EL2NSYNC (45, "Level 2 not synchronized") or EUCLEAN (117, "Structure needs cleaning"). These aren't related to the actual problem, either, but the messages are cool :-).<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; It's worth noting that the application need not continue to hold the lease after mapping the file.</font><br>
<p>
This is invalid behaviour. <br>
<p>
That is, the moment a layout lease is dropped, all guarantees that the lease grants the holder disappear. A lease must be held while the application has an active mapping on the physical layout as the lease is the only thing that guarantees the physical layout underneath the mapping does not change unexpectedly. The moment the exclusive lease is released, anyone can change the layout.<br>
<p>
As I keep saying to people, you don't need to change user data or invalidate cached data to change the file layout. e.g. reflink the file to another new file (doesn't require cache invalidation) can be done, and now RDMA writes will corrupt the reflink'd copy because it doesn't trigger copy-on-write. If it does trigger COW, then the layout changes. Similarly, dedupe could remove physical blocks from the file, as that doesn't require cache invalidation either, and now RDMA on DAX has use-after free problems unless it triggers allocation (and then the layout changes!).<br>
<p>
These are *exactly the problems layout leases are intended to solve*, so the assumption that once the pages are pinned you don't need the layout lease anymore is, quite clearly, fundamentally flawed. <br>
<p>
And, of course, if you don't hold an exclusive lease, somebody can get another exclusive lease on the same file and now we have problems of an exclusive lease holder not being able to modify the layout of the file they have an exclusive lease on, not to mention the other "ex-exclusive holder" has no mechanism to be told the layout got changed. IOWs, the "pin and drop" behaviour described results in breaking the guarantees an exclusive layout lease is supposed to provide the holder.<br>
<p>
This is why I'm concerned about nailing down and documenting the behaviour of layout leases before we go much further - too many people are already assuming they can achieve behaviours and guarantees that are not given, fundamentally flawed and/or broken.<br>

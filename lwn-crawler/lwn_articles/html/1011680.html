           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 27, 2025</br>

Intel's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_branch_tracking">indirect
branch tracking (IBT)</a> is a hardware-implemented control-flow-integrity
mechanism that makes it harder for an attacker to gain control of the
system by way of a corrupted indirect branch.  FineIBT is a software
extension to IBT that is meant to improve its protection.  Recently,
though, Jennifer Miller <a
href="/ml/all/Z60NwR4w/28Z7XUa@ubun">reported</a> a novel way to bypass
FineIBT by taking advantage of how the kernel's system-call entry point is
constructed.  In response, Peter Zijlstra is working on <a
href="/ml/all/20250224123703.843199044@infradead.org">some FineIBT</a>
enhancements to close that hole and make IBT more secure in general.
<p>
The kernel (like many other programs) makes extensive use of indirect
branches, typically in the form of a function call using a pointer value
that is determined at run time.  These indirect calls have always been an
attractive target for attackers; if that pointer can be set to an
attacker-controlled value, the call can be sent to an arbitrary location.
Usually, that is all that is needed to gain control over the system.  In a
body of code as large as the kernel, there will surely be an instruction
sequence that performs some useful operation for an attacker when it is
invoked in an unexpected way.
<p>
IBT implements forward-edge control-flow integrity by blocking indirect
calls to arbitrary locations.  It works by requiring that the target of an
indirect call be a special instruction, either <tt>endbr32</tt> or
<tt>endbr64</tt> (collectively referred to as <tt>endbr</tt>), that serves
as a marker indicating a legitimate call target.  IBT greatly reduces the
number of places an indirect call can go; instead of anywhere in the
program (including in the middle of a multi-byte instruction), calls can
only go to actual function entry points.
<p>
This restriction improves security, but only by so much.  There are still a
lot of functions in a program like the kernel, and much mayhem can be
created by redirecting the control flow to an unexpected function.  The
protection would be much tighter if IBT could ensure that an indirect call
lands on one of the intended targets, rather than on any function.
FineIBT, which was described in <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16353">this paper</a> in 2023, is a step
in that direction.  In the kernel's implementation, every indirect call is
modified to first load a special hash value into a specific register.  The
called function, immediately after the <tt>endbr</tt> instruction, will
compare that hash against the expected value; if the two do not match,
execution is aborted.  The hash is generated from the prototype of the
called function, but is then perturbed at boot time so that the hashes used
in any given running system are different (and hopefully unknown to
attackers).
<p>
FineIBT was merged for the 6.2 kernel and has, hopefully, made life a bit
harder for attackers ever since.  As Miller has demonstrated, though, that
protection is not absolute.  In this case, the way around FineIBT takes
advantage of one special assembly-language function within the kernel, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.4/source/arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S#L49"><tt>entry_SYSCALL_64()</tt></a>,
which is called by the CPU (on x86_64 systems) when user space makes a
system call.  Looking at the code, one can see that it begins, as expected,
with an <tt>endbr</tt> instruction; IBT requires that, even in response to
a system-call trap.
<p>
The following instruction, though, is not the usual FineIBT hash
validation, since this function will not be called from within the kernel.
Instead, it is <tt>swapgs</tt>, which exchanges the contents of the
processor's GS-segment base register with the contents of a special
model-specific register (MSR).  This instruction is needed because, on
entry into the kernel, the kernel's execution environment has not been set
up, so it is not possible to access memory (or do much of anything).
Executing <tt>swapgs</tt> is the first step toward establishing that
environment, allowing access to kernel data and the kernel
stack.  Immediately prior to the return to user space, the kernel will
execute another <tt>swapgs</tt> to restore the GS base register to its
user-space value.
<p>
If an attacker is able to redirect an indirect branch to land on
<tt>entry_SYSCALL_64()</tt>, the hardware IBT check will pass, since the
expected <tt>endbr</tt> instruction is present.  The FineIBT hash check,
though, will not happen, since that code is missing from the function
preamble.  As a result, hostile indirect calls to that function will be
allowed to proceed.  That is bad enough, but the <tt>swapgs</tt>
instruction makes it far worse.  It will restore the user-space GS-base
value (the one that was replaced when the kernel was first entered) while
the CPU is still running in kernel mode; user space is allowed to change
that register, so the kernel's GS base will be set to a value that is
entirely under the control of the attacker.  Among other things, that puts
the kernel stack under the attacker's control; the result is a quick
takeover of the kernel.
<p>
When spelled out in this way, the problem is reasonably obvious; checking a
hash within the called function can only work if every function includes
that checking — and there are functions, including
<tt>entry_SYSCALL_64()</tt>, that cannot do the checking.  Moving the
checking to the caller avoids this problem, at the cost of making the
entire sequence a bit more expensive.  That is the approach that Zijlstra
has taken; the code sequence that is used for this checking, found in <a
href="/ml/all/20250224124200.598033084@infradead.org">this patch</a>,
merits a look:
<P>

    /*
     * Notably LEA does not modify flags and can be reordered with the CMP,
     * avoiding a dependency. Again, using a non-taken (backwards) branch
     * for the failure case, abusing LEA's immediate 0xf0 as LOCK prefix for the
     * Jcc.d8, causing #UD.
     */
    asm(	".pushsection .rodata			\n"
    	"fineibt_paranoid_start:			\n"
    	"	movl	$0x12345678, %r10d		\n"
    	"	cmpl	-9(%r11), %r10d			\n"
    	"	lea	-0x10(%r11), %r11		\n"
    	"	jne	fineibt_paranoid_start    0xd	\n"
    	"fineibt_paranoid_ind:				\n"

    	"	nop					\n"
    	"fineibt_paranoid_end:				\n"
    	".popsection					\n"
    );
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>0x12345678</tt> is patched at run time with the expected hash
value.  When the time comes to perform the indirect call, the <tt>cmpl</tt>
instruction compares the patched-in value against the hash that is expected
to be stored just prior to the entry point for the indirectly called
function.  The <tt>lea</tt> instruction is essentially a fast no-op, but it
is there for the following cleverness.  The <tt>jne</tt> instruction
will look at the result of the <tt>cmpl</tt> two instructions before; in
the not-equal case (the hash did not match) it jumps backward into the
just-executed code; otherwise the <tt>call</tt> is executed as usual.
<p>
Why the backward jump?  Since branches that are not taken are faster than
those that are, it is better to jump in the uncommon case.  This particular
jump is noteworthy, though, in that it will land <i>in the middle</i> of
the <tt>lea</tt> instruction, which will cause the CPU to see an invalid
instruction sequence and generate a <tt>#UD</tt> trap.  This trick, it
seems, is the fastest and most space-efficient way that could be found to
perform the test and generate the trap without slowing down legitimate
indirect function calls (which should be all of them) any more than
necessary.  This special sequence is evidently the brainchild of Scott
Constable at Intel; in <a
href="/ml/all/20250219162107.880673196@infradead.org">a previous
version</a> of the patch set, Zijlstra admonished: "<q>be warned, Scott
loves overlapping instructions</q>".
<p>
At the completion of this patch series, there are a couple of new options
to the painstakingly undocumented <tt>cfi=</tt> command-line parameter.
Setting <tt>cfi=warn</tt> causes control-flow-integrity errors to generate
a warning rather than generating an oops, while <tt>cfi=paranoid</tt>
enables the new verify-before-calling mode.  Toward the end of the series,
there is also <a href="/ml/all/20250224124200.820402212@infradead.org">a
patch</a> adding another option, <tt>cfi=bhi</tt>, that improves the
Spectre mitigations that are supposed to be built into IBT, but which have
been found to be lacking at the hardware level in some processors.
<p>
Zijlstra, in the cover letter, expressed the hope that the current version
of the patch set would be the last before it is merged.  Such hopes are
often dashed in the kernel world, but this series would appear to be
getting close to completion.  It is not clear whether attackers have ever
exploited the bypass reported by Miller but, once this code goes in, the
authors of any such exploits will have to look for a new way to get around
the kernel's control-flow-integrity protections.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

As far as I can see the -0x10 is the requiremet of the FineIBT calling convention (see cfi.h). I.o.w. it's expected. The idea is that the conditional jump is done into the guts of the lea instruction, which makes it's an illegal sequence (in case it is taken).<br>

I think, yes, lea subtracts 0x10.  r11 had the address of func, and __cfi_func is at -0x10.  That is the location of the endbr instruction needed for IBT.<br>

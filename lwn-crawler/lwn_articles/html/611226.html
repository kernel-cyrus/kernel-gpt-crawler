           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 9, 2014</br>
           </div>
A few years back, kernel developers briefly tried to make all device
probing into an asynchronous activity.  The resulting complications proved
to be hard enough to resolve that the effort was deemed to not be
worthwhile and the change was backed out.  Now asynchronous probing is back
on the table.  The idea is 
not being received entirely warmly, but the problem it is trying to solve
is real — and slightly strange.
<p>
Things started in November 2013, when Tetsuo Handa <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/786235eeba0e1e85e5cbbb9f97d1087ad03dfa21">wrote
a patch</a> to make <tt>kthread_create()</tt>, a kernel function which
creates and runs a 
kernel thread, killable (meaning that it will exit on a <tt>SIGKILL</tt> signal).
Prior to this change, any process that was running in
<tt>kthread_create()</tt> would be temporarily immune to <tt>SIGKILL</tt>; in
particular, it would not respond if the out-of-memory (OOM) killer
decided that it was in need of termination.  While there is room for
disagreement with the heuristics by which the OOM killer chooses victims,
few developers believe that those victims, once chosen, should remain in
the system for an arbitrary amount of time.  With Tetsuo's change, a process
that had caused the creation of a kernel thread would no longer be immune
to the OOM killer's wrath.
<p>
Interestingly, this patch caused some systems to fail to boot.  A number of
storage-system drivers require kernel threads to complete the process of
probing for storage arrays.  This probing process can involve a fair amount
of work, to the point that it can take a minute or so to run.  But it seems
that systemd-udev does not have unlimited patience; it starts a 30-second
timer (reduced from three minutes last year)
when loading a device module, and kills the loading process (with
<tt>SIGKILL</tt>) should that timer expire.  So the process trying to probe the
storage array is killed, the array assembly fails, and the system does not
boot.  Prior to Tetsuo's change, the signal would have been ignored during
the probing process;
afterward, it became fatal.  Other types of drivers, such as those that
must go through a lengthy firmware-downloading exercise, can also be
affected by this problem.
<p>
The resulting discussions were spread out across multiple lists and bug
trackers and thus were somewhat hard to follow.
Kernel developers 
seemed to be generally <a href="/Articles/611312/">of the opinion</a> that
a hard-coded 30-second timeout 
in systemd-udev is not a good idea, and that the problem should be fixed
there.  The systemd developers <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.systemd.devel/17860">believe</a>
that any module taking more than 30 seconds to load is simply buggy and
should be fixed.  Tetsuo <a
href="https://launchpadlibrarian.net/169657493/kthread-defer-leaving.patch">suggested</a>
that <tt>kthread_create()</tt> could delay its exit for ten seconds on
<tt>SIGKILL</tt> if that 
signal originates anywhere other than the OOM killer.  None of these ideas
have found a consensus or led to a solution to the problem.
<p>
Of course, there is the option of simply increasing the timeout in the
configuration files, something that was <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/lvm-devel/2013-September/msg00036.html">done
by the device mapper developers</a> in response to a similar problem.  But
that approach strikes nobody as being particularly elegant.
<p>
There is one other way around this difficulty: device drivers could, at
module load time, simply register themselves and do only the work that can be
completed quickly.  Any time-consuming work would be pushed off into a
separate thread to run asynchronously, after module loading is done and
systemd-udev has left the vicinity.  This type of asynchronous initialization
might also have the effect of improving boot times by allowing other work
to happen while the slow probing work is being done.
<p>
To this end, Luis Rodriguez has posted <a href="/Articles/610878/">a patch
set</a> adding asynchronous probing to the driver core.  The patches add a
new field (<tt>async_probe</tt>) to <tt>struct device_driver</tt>; if that
field has a true value, probing for devices will happen asynchronously by
way of a workqueue.  Three drivers (pata_marvell, cxgb4, and mptsas) were
modified to request the new asynchronous behavior.  There is also a variant
of Tetsuo's 10-second-delay patch that is primarily intended to put a
warning into the system log should a non-OOM-killer <tt>SIGKILL</tt> show up in
<tt>kthread_create()</tt>; it is there to help identify other drivers that
need to be converted to the asynchronous mode.
<p>
Tejun Heo, who, among other things, maintains the serial ATA layer, was not
fond of this approach.  His opposition, in the end, <a
href="/Articles/611235/">comes down</a> to two issues:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Any driver can potentially exhibit this problem.  Taking a
     whack-a-mole approach by tweaking drivers with reported issues is thus
     the wrong way to solve the problem — there will always be
     more drivers that still need fixing.
<p>
<li> Linux systems have always managed to have locally attached storage
     devices available when module loading completes.  Moving to an
     asynchronous mode is thus a user-visible behavior change; it could
     well break administrative scripts that expect storage arrays to be
     ready for mounting immediately after the driver has been loaded.
</ul>
<p>
The second issue is the more controversial of the two.  Modern distributions
tend not to make assumptions about when devices will show up in the system,
so some developers <a href="/Articles/611313/">argue</a> that there should
no longer be any problems in this area.  But old administrative scripts can
hang around for a long time.  So the 
risk of breaking real-world systems with this kind of change is real, even
if it is not clear how many systems might be affected.
<p>
Of course, other real-world systems are broken now, so something needs to
be done.  The most likely outcome would appear to be some sort of
asynchronous probing that is done under user-space control; unless user
space has explicitly requested it, the behavior would not change.  The <a
href="/Articles/611311/">probable implementation</a> of this approach is a
global flag that turns on asynchronous device probing, with one exception.
There is a good chance that any kernel code that calls
<tt>request_module()</tt> expects that the requested module's devices will
be available when the call returns.  So modules loaded via this path will,
for now at least, have to be loaded synchronously.
<p>

On distributions where the management of storage arrays is done with
distribution-supplied scripts, the "use asynchronous probing" switch could
be turned on by default.  Others would require some sort of manual intervention.
It is not the best resolution that one might imagine, but it might be the
best that is on offer in the near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The reason for reducing the udev timeout from 180 to 30 seconds no longer applies (it had to do with firmware loading, which is now done entirely by the kernel), so as of yesterday it is back to 180 seconds in systemd git.<br>
<p>
If three minutes is still not enough time, we could probably increase it even more. However, there needs to be some sort of timeout in place to avoid (udev) workers hanging around forever.<br>
<p>
In the specific case of module loading, having the kernel block for several minutes on some module sounds like a problem worth fixing regardless of whether/when udev gives up waiting. If the only problem with asynchronous probing is that some userspace can not deal with it (it is still not entirely clear to me if there are other issues), making this behaviour opt-in at configure time seems like a reasonable solution to me.<br>

I confess that I wrote several scripts in the past that depended on modprobe being synchronous (to load a module for telephony cards). They are probably still in use.<br>
<p>
So is it possible to set the 'use async probing' flag on a per-process basis? I'd prefer to leave the global setting as it is and let systemd load its modules asynchronously.<br>

This seems like a great idea, especially since we could very easily make the kernel's automatic module loading (in response to hardware discovery) asynchronous, while preserving the synchronous behavior of manual module loading for scripting purposes.<br>

Speaking from userspace point of view, both synchronous (for scripting) and asynchronous (for daemons) module loading are useful. In the latter case the notification over epoll about module loading completion is very helpful. <br>
<p>
I don't understand why old administrative scripts should be broken. If current interface is synchronous (I assume it is insmod, am I right?), well, leave it as is and create new async_insmod. Surely inside kernel insmod could be implemented using async_insmod.<br>

Tejun Heo said: "Linux systems have always managed to have locally attached storage devices available when module loading completes."<br>
<p>
This isn't quite true.  The sd_mod module uses async probing for the time-consuming parts of registering a disk drive, such as reading the drive capacity and the partition table.  There is no way to disable this behavior.<br>
<p>
Of course, most systems have the sd driver built into the kernel, not built as a loadable module.  But for those that do, probing of attached drives is not complete when the module finishes loading.<br>

If a driver knows it's going to take a long time to init, it should be able to plead the case with whichever process is loading it.  Since systemd (apparently) runs a logging system, if the driver logs "modulename_init will take at least X more seconds" then systemd should honor it.  Just need to find a standard log format ("modulename_init will complete before abstime=X", etc.).<br>

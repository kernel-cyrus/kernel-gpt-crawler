</div>
Like many kernel developers, Steve Rostedt has found out that user-space
interfaces are hard.  API design is hard in general, but, once an interface
makes it into a released kernel it must be maintained indefinitely.
Breaking applications is just not something that can be allowed to happen.
But we always learn things about ABIs after people start trying to actually
use them.  So, he asked: do we need a way to stage new ABIs into the
kernel?  New interfaces, perhaps, could be specially marked and only
available via debugfs; they could be withdrawn or changed in any future
kernel release.  That scheme would give developers a chance to find and fix
any remaining problems before committing to the ABI.
<p>
The answer from Linus came quickly: "no."  Any sort of staging process for
adding ABIs would, in his opinion, be a failure.  If we need any such
thing, we are clearly just adding too many ABIs in the first place.  We
have too many system calls, and too many other ways of interacting with the
kernel.  We should, instead, be talking about how to say "no" more often.
<p>
Another way of putting it, he said, is that, if you still want people to
try out an ABI, you should not be asking him to pull it.  In general, it
can be better if new interfaces stay out of the kernel for a while.
SystemTap was given as an example here: according to Linus, time has shown
that the SystemTap interface is not a good one.  He's very glad he never
pulled it into the kernel.  The lesson is that it's a good idea to impose a
certain amount of pain on people who want to create new interfaces; let
them live out of the mainline for a while.  If, after five years it looks
like a good idea, the code can be taken upstream.  Maintainers should not
be accepting ABIs which have not seen that sort of testing.
<p>
Ted Ts'o talked for a bit about the financial resources behind some new
features; fanotify was given as an example.  Companies that want such
features will put their cash behind them; given enough time, some of those
features will get past the community's defenses.  It is going to happen at
times, how can we deal with it?
<p>
Another example that was raised was the Android suspend blockers.  The
answer here is that the code has now been merged; the final pieces went in
for 2.6.37.  Of course, it's not suspend blockers that were merged, it was
the opportunistic suspend and wakeup sources work done by Rafael Wysocki;
suspend blockers "done the right way."  The only problem here is that the
Android developers have not said whether they will use this ABI or not;
this particular interface is essentially untested and without users at the
moment.
<p>
Should new ABIs go into linux-next?  Patches going there are supposed to be
intended for merging in the next development cycle, so the answer is "no"
unless it's clear that the ABI is ready to go in.
<p>
What about removing ABIs that we don't like?  Linus's response was, once
again, clear: breaking applications is a regression.  So if he gets even a
single complaint about a removed interface, he'll revert the patch and put
the ABI back.  It's really only possible to remove an ABI if nobody will
notice that it's gone.  Andrew Morton agreed, but also pointed out that we
have to have some way of getting rid of old ABIs if we are going to
preserve our sanity over the long term.  The first step, he says, is to
warn users.  Then, after a while (five to ten years, perhaps), there will
be no users left and the code can go away.  Linus noted that Google can be
an effective way of looking for deprecation warnings.  If nobody has posted
a log with a warning in at least a year, it's probably safe to remove the
interface.
<p>
Andrew added that a bad ABI indicates a failure of the review process.  And
the review process, he said, is what we should be caring about more than
anything else.  When a new ABI is posted, everybody should be looking at
it. He was clearly not happy about the amount of review that is happening
now.
<p>
Dave Airlie asked if it would help to require man pages for every new ABI.
In the past, Michael Kerrisk's man page work has helped to reveal a number
of ABI problems and bugs, but Michael is not doing that anymore.  Linus
responded that we've tried in the past, but it hasn't worked very well.  Al
Viro added that "the man page kind of sucks" is a weak last line of defense
which comes too late.  Beyond that, as Linus noted, man pages tend to
describe system calls, but that's not where the real problem is.  Much more
ABI trouble comes from tracepoints, <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls, sysfs, etc.
<p>
Ted said that, in the end, bad ABIs are really a maintainer problem.
Maintainers have to say "no" more often.  Hugh Dickins suggested that a
special effort could be dedicated to removing crap in the -rc2 and -rc3
releases that was added in -rc1.  At the closing of the session, it was
suggested that there would be value in having a tool which could identify
all new user-space ABIs added since the previous kernel release.  That
could make a good project for somebody who would like to help the
kernel process.

One way to ease the pain of ABIs might be to insist that an ABI have<br>
an API that lives in userland that client code could depend on not<br>
changing and have whoever sponsors the ABI inclusion commit to main-<br>
taining the API and making sure it works across kernel versions, no<br>
matter the ABI stability.  At worst, if the commitment is broken,<br>
the API can be fixed by some responsible user and everybody dependent<br>

This is what they do now, just the boundary between the compatibility interface and the real implementation lies inside the kernel, not in userspace. I'm not sure what difference it would make to move that outside -- it's still the same amount of code to be maintained, and now you introduce potential version skew issues.<br>

Regarding the manpage issue I think one of the big problems is that they fail to describe ioctls, sysfs, etc so it becomes very hard to figure out how to figure out how to use the ABI, or even that it exists.<br>
Hence I think it would be better to add more man pages and require them.<br>

<p>
What mush.  systemtap was never proposed for pulling.  In any case, systemtap does not provide a kernel interface or ABI.  Perhaps he meant "utrace", but that also was not a user-space ABI.  So I can't see what he might have meant in this context.  Can someone clarify / correct?<br>

I think Linus is too stubborn with his willingness to remove existing ABIs. Removing an ABI should be about as hard as adding one, because both actions change the ABI. If a new ABI is introduced then userspace can't be sure it will be there and has to check for it anyway. So the sooner you remove a bad ABI, the better, because less userspace relies on it being there. It doesn't matter if an ABI doesn't work because the kernel is too old, or because the kernel is too new. Waiting 5 to 10 years is the worst possible approach, except for ABIs that are twice that old.<br>

The deadline CPU scheduler has come a long way, Juri Lelli said in his 2017
Linaro Connect session, but there is still quite a bit of work to be done.
While this scheduler was originally intended for realtime workloads,  there is
reason to believe that it is well suited for other settings, including the
embedded and mobile world.  In this talk, he gave a summary of what the
deadline scheduler provides now and the changes that are envisioned for the
near (and not-so-near) future.
<p>
The deadline scheduler was merged in the 3.14 development cycle.  It adds a
realtime scheduling policy that, in many ways, is more powerful than
traditional, priority-based scheduling.  It allows for the specification of
explicit latency constraints and avoids starvation of processes by design.
The scheduler has better information about the constraints of the workload
it is running and can thus make better decisions.
<p>
The kernel's scheduler
is based on the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm, under which the
process with the first-expiring deadline is the one that is chosen to run.
EDF is enhanced with the constant bandwidth server (CBS) algorithm
(described in detail in <a href="/Articles/398470/">this article</a>),
which prevents a process that is unable to run for much of its period from
interfering with others.  Essentially, CBS says that a deadline process
must use its CPU-time reservation over the course of its scheduling period,
rather than procrastinating and expecting the full reservation to be
available right 
before the deadline.  The result is a scheduler that provides strong
temporal isolation for tasks, where no process can prevent another from
satisfying its deadlines.
<p>
At the moment, the mobile and embedded development community is putting a
lot of effort into energy-aware scheduling.  This work has a valuable goal
— making scheduling decisions that minimize a system's energy use — but it
has proved to be hard to get upstream, though it
has been merged into the Android common kernel.  For many workloads, it may
be that deadline scheduling is a better fit for energy-conscious workloads
in the end, Lelli said
<p>
A new feature under development is bandwidth reclaiming.  One of the core
features of deadline scheduling is that, when a process exceeds its
CPU-time reservation (its CPU "bandwidth"), the scheduler will simply
throttle it until its next scheduling period.  This throttling is needed to
ensure that the process cannot interfere with other processes on the

<a href="/Articles/716983/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/connect/JuriLelli-sm.jpg" alt="[Juri Lelli]"
title="Juri Lelli" class="lthumb"></a>

system, but it can be a problem if a process occasionally has a legitimate
need for more than its allotted time.  Bandwidth reclaiming just does the
obvious thing: it gives that process more time if it's not needed by other
processes in the system.
<p>
What is perhaps less obvious is the determination of how much CPU time is not
actually needed.  This is done with the GRUB ("greedy utilization of unused
bandwidth") algorithm described in <a
href="http://disi.unitn.it/~abeni/reclaiming/rtlws14-grub.pdf">this paper
[PDF]</a>.  In short, GRUB tracks how much of the available CPU time is
actually being used by the set of running deadline tasks and, from that,
forms an 
estimate of how much CPU time will go unused.  With that estimate
in place, handing out some of the spare time to a deadline process that
finds itself in need is a relatively straightforward business.
<p>
CPU-frequency scaling is an important tool in the power-management
portfolio, but it has traditionally not played well with realtime
scheduling algorithms, including deadline scheduling.  In current kernels,
it is assumed that realtime tasks need the full power of the CPU, so the
presence of such tasks will cause the CPU to run at full speed.  That may
be wasteful, though, if the deadline processes running do not need that
much CPU time.
<p>
Fixing that problem requires a number of changes, starting with the fact
that the deadline scheduler itself assumes that the CPU will be running at
full speed.  The scheduler needs to be fixed so that it can scale
reservation times to match the current speed of the processor.  This
awareness needs to be expanded to heterogeneous multiprocessing systems
(such as big.LITTLE, where not all processors in the system are equally
fast) as well.
<p>
Once that is done, it would be beneficial to be able to drive CPU-frequency
selection from the deadline scheduler as well.  The CFS scheduler used for
normal tasks uses the <a href="/Articles/531853/">per-entity load
tracking</a> mechanism to help with frequency selection, but the deadline
scheduler currently just pushes the frequency to the maximum.  Once
the bandwidth reclaiming code is in, it will become possible to measure and
use the actual load added by deadline tasks.  At that point, a CPU
frequency that efficiently gets all of the necessary work done can be
chosen.
<p>
Of course, there are always a number of fiddly details to take care of.
For example, on ARM systems, CPU-frequency changes are done in a separate
worker thread.  For CPU scaling and deadline scheduling to work together, a
way for that thread to preempt deadline tasks (which are normally not
preemptable) will need to be found.
<p>
The deadline scheduler currently works at the level of individual
processes; it does not work with control groups.  But there are times when
it might make sense to give a deadline reservation to a group of
processes.  Lelli cited virtual-machine threads and rendering pipelines as
a couple of candidate workloads for group deadline scheduling.  The
implementation envisioned here would be a sort of two-level hybrid
hierarchy.   At the top level, the EDF algorithm would be used to pick the
next group to execute; within that group, though, normal realtime
scheduling (FIFO or round-robin) would be used instead.  Once this feature
works, he said, it could supplant the longstanding <a
href="/Articles/296419/">realtime throttling</a> mechanism.
<p>
Looking further ahead, Lelli said there is a scheme to extend the bandwidth
reclaiming mechanism to allow priority demotion.  Once a process exceeds
its reservation, it will continue to run, but as a normal process without
realtime priority.  That priority will be restored once the next scheduling
period starts.  There is also a strong desire to have fully energy-aware
scheduling in the deadline scheduler.
<p>
A more distant wishlist item is support for single-CPU affinity.  The
priority inheritance mechanism could also stand some improvements.
Currently, a task that blocks a deadline task will inherit that task's
deadline.  Replacing that with an algorithm like the <a
href="https://www.iris.sssup.it/retrieve/handle/11382/305127/1017/paper.pdf">multiprocessor
bandwidth inheritance protocol [PDF]</a> would be desirable.  There is also
a wish for a dynamic feedback mechanism that could adjust a process's
reservation based on its observed needs.  But, for the time being, he said,
nobody is actually working on these items.

Thanks a lot Jonathan for this summary, extremely clear and useful as usual.<br>
<p>
You might want to consider adding a reference to the "IRMOS scheduler" [1] for the group scheduling part.<br>
What we will most likely be implementing for DEADLINE will have many things in common with that solution (that pre-dates DEADLINE and was implemented modifying RT).<br>

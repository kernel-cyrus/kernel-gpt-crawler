<h1>Memory copies in hardware</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted December 7, 2005 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Upcoming versions of Intel processors will include a feature called an
"asynchronous DMA engine."  Essentially, it is a hardware peripheral which
can be used to quickly copy data from one memory location to another.  The
"I/OAT" ("I/O acceleration technology") is expected to improve performance
by offloading copy operations, enabling quick in-memory scatter/gather
operations, and keeping copy operations from pushing useful data out of the
processor's cache.
<p>
Hardware with an I/OAT is not yet available, but <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/161671/">a patch for I/OAT support</a> has
recently been posted.  It lacks the hardware-level interface, but does
demonstrate the API that the folks at Intel have come up with for this sort
of device.
<p>
Code which wishes to make use of the I/OAT must first register itself as a
"DMA client."  The registration interface looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;linux/dmaengine.h&gt;
    typedef void (*dma_event_callback)(struct dma_client *client, 
                                       struct dma_chan *chan, 
				       enum dma_event_t event); 

    struct dma_client *dma_async_client_register(dma_event_callback event_callback);
    void dma_async_client_unregister(struct dma_client *client);
</pre>
<p>

The client must provide a callback function which will be invoked when DMA
channels come and go.  If all goes well, registration results in a
<tt>dma_client</tt> structure which can be used with subsequent operations.
<p>
Before anything can be done, the client must request one or more
"channels."  Every channel on the I/OAT can be used for one copy operation
at a time; all channels can be operating simultaneously.  The function to
request channels is:
<p>
<pre>
    dma_async_client_chan_request(struct dma_client *client, 
                                  unsigned int number);
</pre>
<p>
The client's callback function will be called once for each allocated
channel.  The number of channels actually allocated may be less than what
has been requested.  There is no real guidance on the optimal number of
channels to ask for; the example patch for the networking subsystem
requests one channel for each processor on the system.  The number of
channels can be changed later on if need be.
<p>
There are three functions for actually starting a copy operation:
<p>
<pre>
    dma_cookie_t dma_async_memcpy_buf_to_buf(struct dma_chan *chan,
                                             void *dest, void *src,
                                             size_t len);
    dma_cookie_t dma_async_memcpy_buf_to_pg(struct dma_chan *chan,
                                            struct page *page,
                                            unsigned int offset,
                                            void *kdata, size_t len);
    dma_cookie_t dma_async_memcpy_pg_to_pg(struct dma_chan *chan,
                                           struct page *dest_pg,
                                           unsigned int dest_off,
                                           struct page *src_pg,
                                           unsigned int src_off,
                                           size_t len);
</pre>
<p>
All three functions do the same thing: they request an asynchronous copy
operation from one memory location to another.  The only difference is
whether kernel addresses or <tt>page</tt> structures are used to specify
the locations.  For some reason, it appears to be necessary to issue a call
to:
<p>
<pre>
    void dma_async_memcpy_issue_pending(struct dma_chan *chan);
</pre>
<p>
before the operation will actually happen. 
<p>
Since copy operations are asynchronous, they may not have completed when
the request functions return, so the caller should not mess with the
affected buffers in the mean time.  There are two functions for querying
and waiting for completion:
<p>
<pre>
    dma_async_memcpy_complete(struct dma_chan *chan, dma_cookie_t cookie,
                              dma_cookie_t *last, dma_cookie_t *used);
    dma_async_wait_for_completion(struct dma_chan *chan, 
                                  dma_cookie_t cookie);
</pre>
<p>
<tt>dma_async_memory_complete()</tt> will return one of
<tt>DMA_SUCCESS</tt>, <tt>DMA_IN_PROGRESS</tt>, or <tt>DMA_ERROR</tt>,
depending on the status of the copy operation indicated by <tt>cookie</tt>
(the <tt>last</tt> and <tt>used</tt> arguments can be passed as
<tt>NULL</tt>; their purpose is not entirely clear to your slow editor).  A
call to <tt>dma_async_wait_for_completion()</tt> will wait until the given
operation finishes.  In the current implementation, that wait is
accomplished via a busy loop calling <tt>schedule()</tt>.  There is no
function for canceling an outstanding operation.
<p>

The initial reaction to the patch was cautiously positive.  There is some
concern that invoking an external device to perform copies may be
sufficiently expensive that it will only be worthwhile for very large
operations.  There were also some requests to extend the interface to
include a transformation to be performed on the data as it is copied.  The
current hardware does not look like it will support anything beyond a
direct copy (though, since the hardware is not yet available, it is hard to
be sure), but it would be nice to be able to make use of any such
capabilities as they arrive.  Transformations could be simple (simply
zeroing a buffer, say), or complex (cryptographic operations).  But they
will only be available if the interface supports them.
<p>
The hardware is due in "early 2006," so more information will become
available then.  Until that time, there probably will not be any serious
discussion of merging the I/OAT interface.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Indeed, in a previous life I had to implement a generic DMA api for the SH4 family of processors for use by things like IDE controllers. I even implemented a user space <a href="http://www.m17n.org/linux-sh/ml/linux-sh/2003-10/msg00009.html">interface</a> for controlling DMA for user-space apps.

      ppc4xx is one example - ppc4xx_dma is in need of a reworking anyway. I've recently discovered this in implementing DMA support for MTD devices - having a generic DMA engine API would also help here.<br>
<p>
Side note: I love it when people start talking about amazingly cool technology that Intel apparently will revolutionise the world with, when it's been done for years and years already :-)<br>

      I'm curious on a potential hole with using these devices - the assumption that the destination copy area isn't represented in a processor cache. There are easily a couple of scenarios where this could bite you - <br>
<p>
1) Copying incomming packet buffers to a user or other area. In general, multiple packets will come into the same memory area, so the user will have had a cache hit at one time, the DMA operation occurs, and since the cache isn't invalidated, the user gets the wrong data.<br>
<p>
2) Peek and copy - an area is looked at to determine a value (such as an ARP cache or packet filter rule). Since the data can age, the timestamp is compared. When old, a DMA operation is used to transfer in new data, but the user hasn't invalidated the cache so therefore only gets old data.<br>
<p>
In general, I think any copy operation has to manage the possible cache entries that cover a copy destination, and the general answer of flushing the caches determines a significant portion of the overhead of such a DMA operation - i.e. DMA is efficient when the cost of copying X-bytes &lt;= cost of flushing all caches + cost of CPU coyping of X-bytes.<br>
<p>
Obviously, you could only allow this functionality for non-cacheable memory regions, but then the utility of this function is quite limited.<br>

      That whole thing reminds me of the 82258 ADMA controller I worked with 15 <br>
years ago. It was only 16 bit at that time but it did exactly what the <br>
article describes. It could also do transformations and scatter-gather <br>
and all that stuff. I just put the parameters into some of it's registers <br>
and let it go and it signalled the completion with an interrupt. Seems <br>
like someone discovered that chip and thought that it would be a good <br>
idea. <br>

Is it possible to use this with user memory?  Possibly by calling get_user_pages()?  This doesn't seem to support scatter gather lists though.  Must the memory be contiguous?<br>

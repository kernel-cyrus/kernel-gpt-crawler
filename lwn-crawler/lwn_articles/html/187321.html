<h1>Ext3 for large filesystems</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted June 12, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Linux supports a wide variety of filesystems.  While it is true that the
Linux VFS layer treats all filesystems equally, the ext3 filesystem is
certainly the first among equals.  Ext3 is the default choice for a large
majority of distributions; it can thus be found on vast numbers of
installed Linux systems.  If any filesystem were to be named <i>the</i>
Linux filesystem, it would be ext3.
<p>

Ext3 is based on decades of experience with Unix filesystems.  As a result,
it is relatively straightforward to understand and highly reliable in its
operation.  It is, however, also showing its age in a number of ways.  One
of those is the maximum size of the underlying device it can handle.  This
limit is a mere 8&nbsp;TB.  That is enough to hold most of our mail spools
- even before spam filtering - but it is a limit which is already affecting
some users.  With the size of contemporary disks, the creation of an
8&nbsp;TB array is not an entirely outlandish thing to do now, and it will
only become easier over time.
<p>

There are a couple of reasons for this limit.  One of them is the use of
32-bit block numbers within the filesystem - and signed 32-bit numbers at
that.  The ext3 code can only track 2&nbsp;gigablocks, which, using a 4K
block size, sets the limit at 8&nbsp;TB.  Switching to an unsigned type can
double that limit, but that only pushes back the problem by about one
year.  Clearly, larger block numbers are required.
<p>

The other problem has to do with how ext3 tracks the blocks associated with
any given file.  The ext3 <tt>inode</tt> structure contains an array of
fifteen 32-bit pointers; the first twelve of those pointers contain the
indexes of the first twelve blocks of the file.  Thus, with a filesystem
using 4K blocks, the first twelve pointers can describe a file of up to
48KB in length.  If the file exceeds that length, an "indirect block" is
created.  This block is a big array of block pointers, holding the indexes
for the next 1024 blocks; the 13th pointer in the <tt>inode</tt> structure
tracks the location of this indirect block.  Should that space not suffice,
the 14th pointer is used for a double-indirect block - a block holding
pointers to indirect blocks.  Finally, the 15th pointer will be used for a
triple-indirect block if need be.  
<p>

This arrangement is not too different from how Unix systems structured
filesystems two decades or more ago.  It imposes a per-file maximum size of
about 4&nbsp;TB - big, but perhaps limiting for today's hot applications
(such as comprehensive, nationwide telephone call archival).  It works well
for small files but, as files get larger, this organization becomes
increasingly inefficient.  Keeping a pointer to every single block is
expensive, both in terms of space usage and the time it can take to
locate a specific file block.  Since larger filesystems will tend to hold
larger files, this overhead becomes increasingly limiting over time.
<p>

A solution to these problems can be found in the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/186933/">extents and 48-bit support patch
set</a>.  These patches have been posted by Mingming Cao; many other
developers - especially Alex Tomas - have worked on them as well.  They
change the way files are stored to make things more efficient, and to allow
the filesystem to index the blocks on larger devices.
<p>

The core of the patch is the support for extents.  An extent is simply a
set of blocks which are logically contiguous within the file and also on
the underlying block device.  Most contemporary filesystems put
considerable effort into allocating contiguous blocks for files as a way of
making I/O operations faster, so blocks which are logically contiguous
within the file often are also contiguous on-disk.  As a result, storing
the file structure as extents should result in significant compression of
the file's metadata, since a single extent can replace a large number of
block pointers.  The reduction in metadata should enable faster access as
well. 

<p>

An ext3 filesystem mounted with the extents option enabled will handle files stored
in the old way, using block pointers, as always.  New files will be created
using extents, however.  In these files, the fifteen-pointer array
described above is overlaid with a new data structure.  There is a short
header, followed by a few occurrences of this structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct ext3_extent {
	__le32	ee_block;	/* first logical block extent covers */
	__le16	ee_len;		/* number of blocks covered by extent */
	__le16	ee_start_hi;	/* high 16 bits of physical block */
	__le32	ee_start;	/* low 32 bits of physical block */
    };
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>ee_block</tt> is the index (within the file, not on disk) of the
first block covered by this extent.  The number of blocks in the extent is
stored in <tt>ee_len</tt>, and the pointer to the first of those blocks (on
disk, now) lives in the combination of <tt>ee_start</tt> and
<tt>ee_start_hi</tt>.  By storing physical block numbers this way, ext3 can
handle 48-bit block numbers - enough to index a 1024&nbsp;PB device.  That
should be enough to last for a couple years or so.
<p>
For files with few extents, all of the information can be stored within the
on-disk inode itself.  As the number of extents grows, however, the
available space runs out.  In that case, a form of indirect blocks is used;
the in-inode extents array describes ranges of blocks holding extents
arrays of their own.  The tree of indirect extents blocks can grow to an
essentially unlimited depth, allowing the filesystem to represent even very
large, highly-fragmented files.
<p>
Beyond extents, relatively little had to be done to prepare ext3 for 48-bit
block addressing.  The signed, 32-bit block numbers are gone, having been
converted to the larger <tt>sector_t</tt> type.  Some reserved space in the
ext3 superblock has been grabbed to store the high 16 bits of some global
block counts.  Much of the tracking of free blocks within the filesystem is
done using block numbers relative to the beginning of the block group, so
that code did not need to change much at all.  A few tweaks to the
journaling code were required for it to be able to handle the larger block
numbers. 
<p>
The end result is an enhancement to the ext3 filesystem which enables it to
work with much larger devices.  Existing filesystems can use the new
features immediately with no dump-and-restore cycle.  It would appear to be
(nearly) 
universally agreed that these changes turn ext3 into a better filesystem.
Whether that better filesystem should still be called ext3 is
controversial, but that is a subject for another article.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Actually large amounts of cluster systems seem to run into the 4TB file size and 8TB file limit these days. We had a project that needed approximately of 32 Petabytes for its raw data. I thought it was outlandish, but then got a couple of requests for 2 Petabyte systems for genome research.<br>

      Well, if storage requirements double every 18 months, then 1024 PB will be enough to hold them for just shy of a decade, then.  :-)<br>

      It still amazes me that a single desktop icon on a modern computer takes up about as much RAM as an entire video game console had back in the 80s. <br>
<p>
64MB in the early 80s?  Those must have cost a pretty penny.  I remember 5MB and 10MB disks costing several hundred dollars.<br>

      If you could expand on your post, I'm very curious about it. 2 Petabytes? 32 Petabytes? Where do you store that kind of information? For ther former you would need something like 2048 teraservers, just the power requirements are scary. How do you back it all up?

      "For ther former you would need something like 2048 teraservers" ... or a few modern SAN storage arrays. There are 500TB off-the-shelf solutions available, and I'm sure the manufacturers will be happy to sell you bigger custom variants.<br>

      actually, you can get a petabyte of storage for ~$2m off-the-shelf that fits in ~4 racks consuming ~30KW of power<br>
<p>
buy 40 Sun x4500 servers ( <a href="http://store.sun.com/CMTemplate/CEServlet?process=SunStore&amp;cmdViewProduct_CP&amp;catid=151017">http://store.sun.com/CMTemplate/CEServlet?process=SunStor...</a> ) each with 24TB storage, 2 dual-core opterons, and 16G ram<br>
<p>
so 2PB of storage are $4m in 8 racks (80 servers) consuming ~60KW. that's not too scary (although it is quite a bit)<br>
<p>
backups are an issue, my guess is that the backup is mirroring to another similar set.<br>

      This is from memory so I may be wrong ... <br>
 <br>
In the beginning Linux used the minix file system.  This had many <br>
limitations including as I recall 14 character filename limits. <br>
 <br>
The EXTended filestem was developed to address these problems.  This was <br>
relatively rapidly replased by the second extended filestem (ext2) (I do <br>
not recall what the problems with ext1 were). <br>

Ext3 extended Ext2 with new capabilities - most notably a journel.  This <br>
considerably improves the resilience of the filesystem to unexpected power <br>
failures ! <br>

      Does this all mean that ext3/4 with these patches would handle 1024 PB on a 32 bit system?  Or only on a 64 bit system?<br>
<p>
My understanding is that even XFS has a maximum filesystem size of only 16TB on 32 bit, even though it goes to 9 EB on 64 bit systems.<br>

<p>
Though xfs is fully 64-bit capable on 32-bit machines, the 16T limit is OS-imposed.  There is a 32-bit index into the (4k) page cache on x86, so 2^32 * 4096 is 16T is the maximum offset that can be addressed.<br>

      Not too <i>long</i> ago, Unix systems replaced seek() with the lseek(), and were able to handle longer offsets even though they were 16-bit machines. The word width of your CPU in no way limits the width of words upon which you can perform arithmetic. The new 48-bit field is not using compiler types wider than 32 bits for its implementation. They could use "long long", but I suppose that's less portable.<p><i>Bruce</i>

      Why is the ext3 max block size == 4k?<br>
<p>
Wouldn't just raising EXT3_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE at least temporarily alleviate this problem? <br>
<p>
Obviously the performance issues dealing with large files are still there, and extents is a feature that becomes more and more important, but if you need something now that gives you filesystems larger than 8TB this might be something to explore.<br>

      Raising the block size has a number of consequences for the memory management subsystem in the kernel, as well as the I/O subsystem.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, it would mean that even small files would take up an unreasonable amount of disk space...<br>

      In the current block layer, the block size must be no larger than the page size.  Since page size is 4k on nearly all architectures, 4k blocks are the sane way to go.  I suppose if you gave Itanium boxes to a bunch of kernel developers to test on, they might be inclined to work on larger block sizes.<br>

      well I waited long enough for someone else to remark on this...<br>

"4 TB - big, but perhaps limiting for today's hot applications (such as comprehensive, nationwide telephone call archival)"<br>

      <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3#Size_limits">Wikipedia</a> says that if the block size is 4KiB, the max ext3 file size is 2TiB not 4TiB. And a reading of <code>ext3_max_size</code> function in <tt>linux/fs/ext3/super.c</tt> confirms Wikipedia's opinion.

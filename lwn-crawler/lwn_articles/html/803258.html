<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 28, 2019</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/740157/">BPF in-kernel virtual machine</a> has
brought a new set of capabilities to a number of functional areas in the
kernel, including, significantly, <a href="/Articles/787131/">tracing</a>.
Since BPF programs run in the kernel, much effort goes into ensuring that
they will not cause problems for the running system;
to that end, the BPF verifier checks every possible aspect of each BPF program's
behavior to ensure that it is safe to run in the kernel — with one notable
exception.  With a patch set titled "<a
href="/ml/netdev/20191016032505.2089704-1-ast@kernel.org/">revolutionize
bpf tracing</a>", Alexei Starovoitov aims to close that loophole and
eliminate a set of potential problems in a widely used class of BPF
programs.
<p>
BPF is heavily used in tracing applications to gain access to
useful kernel information and to perform data aggregation in kernel space.
There are two variants of these programs.  If a tracepoint has been
placed in a useful location in the kernel, a BPF program can be attached
there; otherwise, a kprobe can be placed at (almost) any kernel location
and used to trigger a BPF program.  Either way, the BPF verifier currently
has little visibility into the data that will be passed to those programs.
<p>
Consider, for example, the <tt>trace_kfree_skb</tt> tracepoint placed in
<tt><a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4-rc2/source/net/core/dev.c#L4575">net_tx_action()</a></tt>.
When this tracepoint triggers, any handlers (including attached BPF
programs) will be passed two pointers, one to the <tt>sk_buff</tt>
structure representing the network packet of interest, and one to the
function that is freeing that packet.  The type information associated with
those pointers is lost, however; the program itself just sees a pair of
64-bit unsigned integers.  Accessing the kernel data of interest requires
casting those integers into pointers of the correct type, then using
helpers like <tt>bpf_probe_read()</tt> to read the data behind those
pointers.  A series of <tt>bpf_probe_read()</tt> calls may be needed to
walk through a data structure and get to the data the tracing program is
actually looking for.
<p>
The problem is that a BPF program can cast one of these values into any
type it likes; the result need not correspond to the actual type of that
data.  A 
mistake could cause a BPF program to go off into the weeds; in one
worst-case scenario, the program could wander into a memory-mapped I/O area
and cause some real damage.  This isn't generally a security issue, since
tracing is a privileged operation to begin with, but it is a safety issue —
exactly the sort of issue that the BPF verifier is meant to prevent.
<p>
This problem has existed since the kernel first gained the ability to
attach BPF programs to tracepoints and kprobes.  Meanwhile, BPF developers
have been working on <a href="/Articles/773198/">an entirely different
problem</a>: the lack of binary portability for BPF programs.  These
programs go digging around in kernel data structures, but the layout and
content of those structures varies depending on the kernel configuration, the
underlying architecture, and more.  The data of interest to any given
program may be located 12&nbsp;bytes into a structure on one kernel, but only
8&nbsp;bytes into that structure on a different kernel.  Without the
ability to "relocate" 
these references, BPF users must rebuild their programs on every target
system.
<p>
The "compile once run everywhere" effort has, over the last couple of years
or so, worked to address this problem through the creation of a compact,
machine-readable description of the kernel's data structures.  This "BPF
type format" (BTF) data is provided by the kernel itself, but it can be
used by user-space support libraries to 
adjust a binary BPF program for a local kernel before loading it, mostly
solving the binary portability issue.  But it turns out that BTF
information has other uses as well.
<p>
In particular, it is possible to annotate tracepoints with information
about the types of the data values passed to handler programs.  That allows
the verifier to ensure that those programs are working with the correct
data types.  It also makes it possible for the C handler programs to follow
pointers directly; when those programs are compiled to BPF and
loaded into the kernel, the verifier can implicitly substitute the 
<tt>bpf_probe_read()</tt> calls where they are needed — after performing
the necessary type checking, of course.
<p>
The end result of all this will be BPF tracepoint handler programs that are
safer and far less error-prone to write.  Whether tracing is
"revolutionized" remains to be seen, but it is clearly improved in a
significant way.
<p>
What is decidedly not revolutionized is data access within kprobe
handlers.  A kprobe can be set anywhere in the running kernel, and it is
given access to the contents of the processor registers when the probe is
hit.  It is not, at this point, possible for the verifier to know what will
be in those registers at that time, so this kind of checking cannot be
done.  That means that, especially in the parts of the kernel that are not
amenable to the addition of proper tracepoints, the use of BPF programs
without this sort of type checking will have to continue.
<p>
That said, progress is progress, and this work will increase the safety of
much of the tracing code that is currently in use.  It has been queued in
the bpf-next tree so, barring some sort of last-minute hitch, it can be
expected to show up in the 5.5 kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'm excited to see where BPF / eBPF tracing is going.

<h2>Remember userspace</h2>

But I'm also seeing echoes of a repeating pattern here. Userspace, as always, seems to be relegated to an uninteresting afterthought. Perhaps less so than was the case with perf, but still to a concerning degree.

<h2>Generations of tools with production userspace as an afterthought</h2>

We've been through a lot of tracing tools and frameworks both for generating/annotating traceable data and for collecting/processing it. uprobes, <code>ftrace</code>, dtrace-for-linux, SystemTap, linux-perf and <code>perf_events</code>, LTTng, and more. They're inter-related and not a simple generational series of changes. 

But one pattern seems to have persisted pretty strongly: nothing works very well with "real world" production userspace deployments initially, yet earlier generations of tools tend to be abandoned. If you go to use one tool you're told it's obsolete, you should use the new one instead, but that one doesn't actually work on any of the systems widely deployed in production and won't for a long time yet. When it does, it probably doesn't support external debuginfo (like every system has had for 10+ years) for another year or two after that, because really, who debugs packaged binaries on production systems?

So this time around I'm going to plead for some attention to userspace, including the boring parts of userspace above the C library, allocator and syscall wrappers. Because tracing is incredibly useful when working with complex real world systems, in production, supporting live workloads. But that seems to be the last priority when tools are being worked on.

(If I can get involved in relevant testing, UX, bug fixing etc please reach out; craig.ringer@2ndquadrant.com is the best address and make sure to mention tracing in the subject.)

<h2>SystemTap is amazing with userspace (now)</h2>

I recently got around to learning SystemTap after, again, being unable to make perf do what I want for my tracing needs. It's *amazing*. It has a few frustrating deficiencies and I understand that its "kernel modules compiled on demand" design doesn't have a future. But the tool itself is like nothing else I've ever used, it's incredible, warts and all. In particular:

<ul>
<li> It can traverse complex data structures, with logic where needed not just simple expressions</li>
<li>It can access global variables (via DWARF lookups, with debuginfo) which is vital in nontrivial systems</li>
<li>It can integrate events from multiple tracked processes to observe complex behaviour of multi-process systems</li>
<li>It can place all sorts of probe events on function calls, returns, static tracepoint markers, statement level probes, process start/end, and much more</li>
<li>... and it makes all that pretty easy so you can focus on the actual details of the program you are tracing without rewriting half the tools you need each time.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Example I used it for in PostgreSQL</h3>

With SystemTap I was able to rapidly gain insight into the deep guts of PostgreSQL's behaviour in a way I've never been able to do before, even when patching PostgreSQL itself and post-processing trace logs.

I can follow the lifecycle of nontrivial events in the system and collect timing and stats on them. My stap script observes a lot of activity:

<pre>
* observe all backend fork()s to determine backend process type (postmaster, logical or physical walsender, client backend, etc) and decide what to observe in that backend dynamically
* For user backends:
  * frontend connects
  * backend attaches
  * backend starts transaction
  * backend assigns non-virtual transaction-id
  * backend ends txn?
    * rollback? Stop tracking
    * commit? 
      * See if we need to follow it through logical decoding or not by inspecting the state at commit time (current db, active replication slots, etc)
    * prepare 2pc txn?
      * Add it to a "prepared xacts" track-list
  * backend runs a 2PC commit prepared or rollback prepared?
      * record time from prepare to commit/rollback
      * then observe logical decoding as if it's a normal commit
* logical replication walsender backends:
    * notice when we start buffering data for a new committed xid, start timing
    * wait for logical decoding to finish buffering the commit
    * when commit is decoded, record total buffering time
    * observe output plugin calls when buffered commit is being sent to client. Take timing info and stats on the types of operations sent and processing duration. Record info on skipped-over rows, tables, etc where we buffered them but discarded the buffered data.
    * record time final commit sent to client
    * wait for the receiver to confirm that the txn was received in full
    * record time client confirmed commit
* logical replication receiver / apply worker backends:
  * observe when a commit arrives from the logical walsender
  * associate it with the timing data collected for it on the origin side
  * record how long we take to apply it, whether it waits for locks, which ones and for how long
  * report final apply time
* Generate summary statistics periodically and on exit
* Optionally generate detailed trace logs of targeted activity, optionally  filtered to focus only on one client application / client connection
</pre>

It's amazing to have this level of insight. And now that I've written the basic tapset to inspect the relevant parts of PostgreSQL I can massage it to extract all sorts of timing, performance, and behaviour data. (It'd be a lot more amazing if it weren't for some bugs in systemtap that make it a LOT harder to make the foundations I wrote reusable, though, per reports to the seemingly dead systemtap mailing list).

I even extended it so it can associate two sides of a network connection as logical replication peers (if they're on the same host only, so far) and observe message-passing timings and processing delays across the wire. So I can see whether the sending side is waiting for more data to send, waiting for the client to consume its buffer, etc. I can see if the sender is delayed by the client waiting on a lock, waiting on I/O, etc.

<h2> Out with the old, in with the new? Again?</h2>

But I've since learned that SystemTap is considered pretty much dead and obsolete.

Yet I cannot use eBPF on any production systems I'm likely to encounter in the next year or two. And even then, will I be able to get this level of access to userspace?

Meanwhile perf never really gained complete enough tracing features to be of much use without a large amount of postprocessing using "perf script". It cannot even time syscalls from the enter to the exit sdt probe! 

<h2> So please consider userspace</h2>

I'd love to help out if anyone working on these tools wants constructive input, testing, bug checking etc from someone who works on the PostgreSQL database backend in real world production deployments. Reach out to me, craig.ringer@2ndquadrant.com.

Oh, while I'm at it, here are some notes I made on new-user experience with stap<br>

* <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443706/398670">https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443706/398670</a><br>
<p>
If I had to list priorities for what counts as "useful for userspace" these would be some of the most important:<br>
<p>
* DWARF based probes on function entry and exit<br>
* Support for external DWARF debuginfo<br>
* Support for reading SDTs from .probe ELF sections like perf's "sdt:" or stap's "mark"<br>
* process-entry and process-exit probes<br>
* A fast, efficient output channel, preferably structured objects not just text so it can be ingested for postprocessing/integration<br>
* Access to function parameters on function entry, return value on exit<br>
* A few ways to target processes:<br>
  * pid or list of pids<br>
  * parent pid<br>
  * process group id<br>
  * cgroup id<br>
  * fully qualified executable(s) path(s) including libraries<br>
  * probing in ld.so link time libraries<br>
  * probing in dlopen()ed libraries<br>
* Simple way to record the values of string arguments not just their addresses<br>
* Expressions for traversal of probed argument structs using DWARF debuginfo<br>
  * preferably with null-safe traversal like Groovy's wonderful .? operator<br>
* A means of accessing global variables, akin to stap's @var with optional compilation unit and module/executable name to qualify resolution<br>
* A means of casting pointers to datatypes extracted from DWARF data like stap's @cast operator so they can then be traversed<br>
* Some level of control/feedback back into the probes so recording/capture/reporting can be turned on and off contextually, so you can focus only on data of interest<br>
<p>
So, pretty much "what systemtap does".<br>
<p>
I expect I could live without the the global associative arrays etc if probes ran in their own per-process (or per-thread) spaces and had some way to easily and efficiently turn particular probes on/off per-process/per-thread, define conditional expressions for which they'd fire, etc.<br>
<p>
Similarly, stap's @entry feature to "remember" function args at entry time for probes on function return is great. But it can largely be worked around externally, at the cost of sometimes reporting much more information than needed to the postprocessing tools.<br>
<p>
If anyone's been playing with this stuff around eBPF please poke me. Also, if anyone's been exploring ideas for a new generation of dtrace-alike SDT probes that embed argument name and datatype information, let me know, I'm really keen to get involved.<br>

Given that you seem to be a huge systemtap fan I assume you already know about stapbpf?<br>
Which tries to bring everything stap does through generating BPF.<br>
It is not fully on par yet, but getting there:<br>

      <p>I've had a quick look at stapbpf, yes, and I think the direction looks interesting. I tried it with stap 4.1 and couldn't capture and report a string variable's value though, so I pretty much wrote it off as not complete enough to be useful yet. I just retried with git HEAD with the same outcome.</p>

<pre>
semantic error: function may not be used with bpf runtime: identifier 'user_string_n' at /usr/share/systemtap/tapset/uconversions.stp:114:10
        source: function user_string_n:string (addr:long, n:long)
                         ^

Pass 2: analysis failed.  [man error::pass2]
Number of similar error messages suppressed: 2.
Rerun with -v to see them.
</pre>

<p>I've learned a bit more about stap since though and noticed the bpf:: tapsets. But they seem to be mostly a WIP skeleton.</p>

I've been involved with the work to push stapbpf closer to a full-featured tracer. Complete feature parity with SystemTap's LKM backend will not be achievable, because BPF (even with recent enhancements) has inherent limitations. That said, there are important stapbpf features still in the pipeline:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?component=bpf&amp;product=systemtap&amp;resolution=---">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?component=bpf...</a><br>
<p>
At the moment, if you want to understand what BPF can and can't do, bcc/bpftrace versus SystemTap LKM is probably a more fair comparison.<br>
<p>
user_string_n() would have been implementable rather quickly, if all we cared about is x86_64:<br>
<p>
function user_string_n (addr:long, n:long) {<br>
   // In BPF the same bpf_probe_read() functions that read data from a kernel<br>
   // address are also used by bcc tools to read from user space addresses.<br>
   // It Happened To Work On x86_64, So Why Not^tm?<br>
   return kernel_string_n (addr, n) // &lt;- calls bpf_probe_read_str()<br>
}<br>
<p>
I missed the availability of this misfeature my first time going through the BPF helper documentation, which says "this function reads data from an address" without specifying whether it's a kernel or user address. Looking at the implementation I noted it calls a function that takes kernel addresses. "Seems like BPF doesn't support reading from userspace yet," thought I, and left it at that.<br>
<p>
The issue caught the attention of Torvalds in February:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wjJqVXydQf_dprBmr=zXsyNVrB9mBCmDL0nGmH_b0vY5g@mail.gmail.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wjJqVXydQf_dprBmr=zXsy...</a><br>
<p>
Now in October it's being fixed:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/637eba87807516061f1fee93536053507ea20b0a.1572483054.git.daniel@iogearbox.net/T/#u">https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/637eba87807516061f1fee9353605...</a><br>
<p>
Then existing BPF tools relying on the misfeature will be fixed, e.g.:<br>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/issues/614">https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/issues/614</a><br>
<p>
When the bpf_probe_read_{user,kernel} patch makes it into a release, stapbpf can add userspace tapset functions that won't return the wrong data when there's a discrepancy between user and kernel addressing.<br>

 Not much yet - I studied systemtap first, because I wanted to start with something fairly mature and that will be available on customer systems in the forseeable future.<br>
<p>
I'm hoping to find time to look at eBPF-tools, bcc and bpftrace soon though.<br>

Thanks for all the help! I like how sytemtap works - and the excellent, comprehensive documentation. <br>
<p>
So I'm hoping it'll be possible to transition it over to BPF in a useful way rather than the community doing the "out with the old, in with the new" thing and jumping on bpftrace/bcc/whatever.<br>

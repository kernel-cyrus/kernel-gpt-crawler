<p>
Building new kernels and booting into them is an unavoidable—and
time-consuming—part of kernel development.  Andrea Righi works for
Canonical on the Ubuntu kernel team, so he does a lot of that and wanted to
find a way to speed up the task.  To that end, he has been working
on <a href="https://github.com/arighi/virtme-ng">virtme-ng</a>, which is a
way to boot a new kernel in a virtual machine, and it does
so quickly.  He came to the <a href="https://lpc.events">2023
Linux Plumbers Conference</a> (LPC) in Richmond, Virginia to introduce the
project to a wider audience.
</p>

<p>
His team builds lots of kernels for multiple architectures, often applying
patches and fixes that need to be tested to ensure that they work and do
not introduce regressions.  There is a large testing infrastructure for
that, but sometimes developers want to get more "hands on" with these
kernels, for example to do a <tt>git&nbsp;bisect</tt>.  There are often
lots of build-reboot cycles for the work that he does, so his goal to
reduce the time that they take. 
</p>

<a href="/Articles/951508/">

alt="[Andrea Righi]" title="Andrea Righi" height=280 width=244>
</a>

<p>
When he tests a kernel, he generally does so from a clean environment, so he
will redeploy the system being used from a fresh image.  That ensures the
previous run has not left some kind of corruption behind that will affect
the current run, but that takes time too.  In general, kernel development
is lacking 
the fast edit-compile-test loop that developers are used to from user-space
development. 
</p>

<p>
His goal was to figure out how to, essentially, clone his development machine
into another machine running the new kernel.  He wanted the test system to
have access to 
the root filesystem of the parent system; he also needed to be able to make
changes in the test system without affecting the parent.  That way there
would be no redeployment needed and he would be able to, more or less
instantly, access a system to run his tests.
</p>

<p>
Once he came up with this idea, he started looking around and encountered
<a href="https://github.com/amluto/virtme">virtme</a>, written by Andy
Lutomirski, which did much of what he was looking for.  It virtualizes the
running system by creating a live snapshot of it, then starting a virtual
machine with a new kernel.  It exports the root filesystem to the guest
using the <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/9p.html">9p</a>
filesystem in read-only mode and allows writes to a tmpfs home directory. 
</p>

<p>
He was happy to find virtme and started using it, but it had some
limitations and only really
covered about&nbsp;80% of the features that he needed.  The read-only root
filesystem meant that additional packages could not be installed on the test
system, which limited the testing he could do.  In addition,&nbsp;9p had
rather poor performance, so that, for example, a <tt>git&nbsp;diff</tt> in
the kernel tree on the guest would take five minutes to run.  That
limited the testing he could do, but it also affected the boot time, which
was longer than he wanted.  It was taking around&nbsp;15 seconds to boot to a
console prompt, which he thought could be improved.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, virtme is not being maintained; Lutomirski no longer has
the time to do so.  Pull requests (PRs) from Righi and others were not being
acted on, so he contacted Lutomirski, who encouraged him to create a fork.
Righi created virtme-ng, went through the PRs on virtme and merged those
that he liked.
</p>

<p>
Since then, he has added a number of different features, starting with
using <a href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">virtiofs</a> and <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html">overlayfs</a> to
provide a copy-on-write export of the entire
host filesystem, instead of using&nbsp;9p. Virtiofs requires more infrastructure,
such as a FUSE daemon running on the host, but it performs much better than&nbsp;9p.
Overlayfs then allows the guest to write to the filesystem, so that it can
install 
packages, say, without actually affecting the host.
</p>

<p>
Another fairly major change was the adoption of the QEMU <a
href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/i386/microvm.html">microvm</a>
virtual-machine type.  That was suggested to him by someone on Twitter when
he had 
tweeted about his boot-time-reduction progress.  Righi also switched
virtme-ng to use a custom init script written in Rust to replace the Bash
init script that virtme uses.  The Bash script was not much of a
maintenance problem, but he had an interest in learning Rust, so he rewrote
it in that 
language, which turned out to have some large benefits in terms of boot time. 
</p>

<p>
Simply switching from&nbsp;9p to virtiofs made a huge difference in terms of I/O
speed; the <tt>git&nbsp;diff</tt> dropped from&nbsp;284s to just 1.7s.
That operation generates an enormous amount of I/O, which can be 
done efficiently in the FUSE-based virtiofs, because it puts the results into
memory shared with the guest; with&nbsp;9p, each I/O operation and result
was a separate message using the&nbsp;9p protocol.
In 
addition, the boot time went from&nbsp;6.2s to&nbsp;5.2s, which was less dramatic
because there is a lot less I/O for booting the system.
</p>

<p>
Adding overlayfs on top of virtiofs allowed the guest to access and write
to the host filesystem—without making any permanent changes.  It uses a
tmpfs as the upper directory, so when the VM exits, any changes made are
gone.  He did encounter a problem with overlayfs using the
<tt>O_NOATIME</tt> flag, which caused permission errors for the virtiofs FUSE
daemon, but that has now been fixed in the virtiofs upstream.
</p>

<p>
The microvm machine type is just an option to QEMU that provides a machine
optimized for boot time and memory size.  It does not have PCI or ACPI,
which saves time for probing and the like.  Adding that into the mix
dropped the boot time from&nbsp;5.2s to&nbsp;3.8s.  That reduction is not huge in
absolute terms, but it makes a large difference if you are using virtme-ng
to boot lots of different kernels, he said.
</p>

<p>
Using the new Rust virtme-ng-init further reduced the boot time to&nbsp;1.2s.  Those boot times are measured from the time he types <tt>vng</tt> to
start the VM with a new kernel until he gets to a prompt where he can start
typing commands into the guest. "That is quite amazing."  For a bisect run,
it can make a huge difference, for example.
</p>

<p>
Righi considered doing a demo in the talk, but was concerned about it not going
well.  He has made a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sDkVuXVw9A">YouTube video</a> of a
live virtme-ng demo and he described some of the things that he showed in
it.  You can do more than just type commands at the guest's
shell once the VM boots; you can run scripts in the guest from the
<tt>vng</tt> command 
line, for example.  Virtme-ng has standard input and output set up so that
you can 
run a command on the host, piped to a VM with a certain kernel, piped to a
VM with a different kernel, and so on, which allows automating testing of a set
of kernels.  It can also be used to run graphical applications; his final
demo in the video is running the Steam client on the guest and showing
that the game is perfectly playable on the host display.
</p>

<p>
He hopes that virtme-ng can bring the fast edit-compile-test cycle to
kernel development.  Even just over a second is nice, but that is measured
on his laptop; on his more powerful home server, he can break the
one-second barrier, with boot times of&nbsp;0.8-0.9s.  The tool is meant to be
backward compatible with virtme, so he considers any problems in
compatibility to be a bug that needs to be fixed; he encouraged anyone that
encountered a problem of that sort to report it to the GitHub repository.
</p>

<p>
Righi has the opportunity to work with students, who are generally quite
excited to be able to change and build their own kernels, but have trouble
with deploying those kernels onto VMs.  When he shows them virtme-ng, it
really helps to get them up and running quickly; he thinks the tool can be
a way to smooth the path for any new kernel developers.  He also <a
href="/Articles/935180/#eco">gave a talk</a> at the OSPM power management
and scheduling conference in April about being "more carbon efficient" by
using virtme-ng to reduce the amount of time spent doing redeployment and
the like for continuous-integration (CI) systems.
</p>

<p>
The goal of his talk, Righi said, was to raise awareness of the tool in
order to increase the user base.  There are some people at SUSE using the
tool, including for testing live patches, some Google developers use it as
well; a Debian developer has started packaging virtme-ng, so it is
available for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions. There is work
going on to provide an RPM package for virtme-ng; with that 
and the Debian work, most distributions should be covered soon. He would like
to collect more feedback from users as it basically does what he needs now,
but there are probably other use cases that could be handled.
</p>

<p>
It is not a priority, but he would like to add full systemd
support to the tool; systemd does not work correctly currently because it
has its own state in the host system that confuses a systemd that gets
started for the guest.  A systemd-based VM will not start as quickly as the
custom init script, but it would bring capabilities that the current guests
do not have.
</p>

<p>
For example, he wanted to run the snap server in the guest,
but it is a systemd-based daemon.  He has a hack to trick the snap
daemon into thinking that there is a systemd running, but he would like a
better solution. The snap mode (which is enabled with a command-line
option) works and is generally stable, but with better systemd support,
both it and 
Flatpak 
would be cleanly supported by virtme-ng. 
</p>

<p>
An audience member asked about supporting alternate user IDs, so that a root
filesystem from a 
tar file could be used instead 
of the host filesystems.  Righi said that there is some support for that use
case, but that the user ID problem is not solved cleanly; <a
href="/Articles/896255/">ID-mapped mounts</a> was suggested as a potential
path for handling that better.  Another question was about adoption by
other open-source projects; Righi said that <a
href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter">Mutter</a> is using virtme-ng
as part of its testing.  There is also an unnamed company using the tool to
test webcams, which surprised him, but it turns out the company is using
QEMU options to pass a USB device from the host to the guest for testing
multiple kernels with the webcam.
</p>

<p>
The VMs can be used with GDB, he said responding to another query;
you can set breakpoints and such, as well as create a crash dump if
desired.  Another attendee asked about support for signed modules; Righi
said that looking into that is on his "secret to-do list", so he was happy
to get the question to spur him to look at it sooner.

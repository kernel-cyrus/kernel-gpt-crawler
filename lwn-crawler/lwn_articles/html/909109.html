<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 26, 2022</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2022-Linux_Plumbers_Conference">LPC</a>
</div>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device">Human
Interface Device</a> (HID) standard dates back to the Windows&nbsp;95 era.
It describes how devices like mice and keyboards present themselves to the
host computer, and has created a world where a single driver can handle a
wide variety of devices from multiple manufacturers.  Or it would have, if
there weren't actual device manufacturers involved.  In the real world,
devices stretch and break the standard, each in its own special way.  At
the <a href="https://lpc.events">2022 Linux Plumbers Conference</a>,
Benjamin Tissoires described how BPF can be used to simplify the
task of supporting HID devices.
<p>
Most devices, he began, will work just fine with the kernel's generic HID
drivers.  That still leaves quite a few that present problems — behavioral
quirks that require a special driver to address.  Most of the time, that
driver need only make a few tweaks to the "report descriptor" provided by
the device.  This descriptor, the format of which was defined in 2001,
describes the exact protocol a device speaks and which capabilities it
offers.  The kernel contains a long list of tiny drivers that do little
beyond tweaking a device's report descriptor to make it adhere to the
standard; see <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.10/source/drivers/hid/hid-sigmamicro.c"><tt>drivers/hid/hid-sigmamicro.c</tt></a>
for an example.  Others, only slightly more complex, will modify input events
upon receipt from the device; <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.10/source/drivers/hid/hid-ezkey.c"><tt>drivers/hid/hid-ezkey.c</tt></a>
shows that type of manipulation.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/909115/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lpc/BenjaminTissoires-sm.png" alt="[Benjamin
Tissoires]" title="Benjamin Tissoires" class="rthumb"></a>

Device manufacturers, of course, show no sign of running out of ideas for
new ways to make broken hardware, so the kernel will continue to need to
fix things up in new ways.  Currently, each quirk fix requires the
writing of a new driver, which must then go through the usual kernel review
process before getting upstream and, some time later, onto the systems
where the offending device is actually used.  This is not a great
experience for users and creates work for developers; it gets worse if
developers lack access to the device in question and must rely on users to
build kernels to test proposed fixes.  If there were a way
to just describe the tweaks needed for a given device, then new devices
could be supported quickly on existing kernels, without adding more kernel
modules.
<p>
That way, of course, is BPF.  The idea behind <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220824134055.1328882-1-benjamin.tissoires@redhat.com/">Tissoires's
work</a>, which seems likely to be merged for 6.1, is to make it possible
to easily create a small program to make a new device work.  That program
could be dropped into a directory, from which it would be loaded into the
kernel.   Users will not need to  worry about building kernels, and
developers can avoid adding more
little modules.  Instead, the plan is to add these BPF programs to the
upstream kernel as needed to support new devices.
<p>
But, Tissoires said, once it becomes possible to modify device behavior
with BPF, there are other interesting things that can be done.  One of
those was described as the "HID firewall".  Steam, he said, makes game
controllers accessible to any process running on the system; a malicious
program could rewrite a device's firmware in ways that are unlikely to improve the
owner's player ranking.  A simple BPF program could block access to the
firmware-update endpoint on the device, preventing such attacks.
<p>
It is also possible to transform devices into something different.  The <a
href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/meet-surface-dial-1e58a0e6-4d4a-6303-afcd-ef0234047628">Microsoft
Surface Dial</a>, he said, is an interesting input device but, because it
is new and different, no software supports it.  A BPF program could tweak
data coming from the device to make it appear to be a mouse instead, making
it usable with existing software.
<p>
BPF can also be helpful in debugging problems with HID devices.  The
<tt>hidraw</tt> device provides useful data now, he said, but it only shows
data from a device; there is no way to see the accesses <i>to</i> that
device.  BPF would make it easy to trace the full interaction with a HID
device.
<p>
BPF programs are executed on data from the device before it is processed by
the HID core, he said; that makes it possible for them to modify that data.
Multiple programs can be attached to a single device, but the order in
which they will be executed is "undefined".  Beyond tweaking data, BPF
programs can do things like filtering out spurious button clicks.  It will
also be possible for BPF programs to communicate directly with devices.
<p>
The implementation relies on tracepoints and, specifically, the
error-injection capability.  Tracepoints are added at places where changes
can
usefully be made: reading the report descriptor, receipt of input events,
and on a user system call.  A set of kfuncs has been provided to facilitate
communication with the device;  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220824134055.1328882-26-benjamin.tissoires@redhat.com/">this
documentation patch</a> describes the BPF interface in detail.
<p>
An important limitation, Tissoires said, is that BPF cannot be used to fix
devices that are broken (and needed) at boot time.  Specifically, that
rules out using BPF for most fixes applying to keyboards.
<p>
One open question, he said in conclusion, is determining the best method
for shipping device fixes with the kernel.  One approach would be to create
a separate module for each BPF source file, but that, once again, leads to
the creation of a lot of modules.  ("Module" was his word; he may have been
speaking about loader programs that run in user space, though).
Alternatives would be to create one big
module with a lot of BPF programs, or to just ship the fixup programs from
the firmware repository instead.

I sincerely hope these get shipped as out-of-kernel BPF files akin to firmware, because that would allow for a widely useful but currently frustrating &quot;Yes I know it&#x27;s valid but it&#x27;s badly implemented&quot; situation that&#x27;s been long-standing for years now to allow for having a lot more H.264 and/or MJPEG webcams on a single port by finally having a (relatively trivial) way to override the USB descriptor.<br>
<p>
The camera may consume the entire allocatable (which is comically just over 50% of the available) bandwidth on a USB 2.0 port when in &#x27;raw&#x27; modes, but that bandwidth drops significantly in the &#x27;compressed&#x27; video modes, but there&#x27;s no support in the standard to specify proper compressed bandwidth estimates.<br>

The UVC specification requires the device to report the bandwidth it needs. The issue is that many devices don&#x27;t bother to get the number right and just return a very large value.<br>

Both are true, there&#x27;s no support AFAIK to indicate variable bandwidth so H264 best case will report the I-frame-only bandwidth which is still an order of magnitude too high.<br>
<p>
Much like AVI USB UVC doesn&#x27;t have good support for anything but fixed data structure format descriptions last I checked.<br>
<p>
But either way these sound like a great avenue to allow webcam capture software to handle compressed-video USB cameras far better despite manufacturers shoddy firmware.<br>

I&#x27;m pretty sure BPF programs can&#x27;t arbitrarily send packets. Unlike kernel modules - which they are supposed to replace in this case. So, no more keylogging for you, I guess! ;-)<br>
<p>
In any case, I doubt maintainers would accept either a kernel module or a BPF program containing a keylogger. And for manufacturer supplied third party stuff, possibly binary only, BPF programs seem safer than kernel modules to me.<br>

Hopefully eBPF-HID would be contained to not be able to access anything that is available to eBPF other than very few, if any, whitelisted functions to manipulate the descriptors and event stream.   It certainly should not be able to call into any networking hooks/functions.<br>
<p>
But that alone is already dangerous, as manipulating input device event streams can be a way to inject commands into a running system.  One can also keylog to memory, and dump the log to a listener process, etc.  Both are highly undesirable if done without the local sysadmin's knowledge and approval -- even if there are other ways to do the same.<br>
<p>
So, it would be best to restrict eBPF-HID to *signed* "firmware" (eBPF programs), and by that I mean signed by whomever builds the kernel -- like modules can be.  Do we have require-signed-eBPF support already?<br>

This standard “has created a world where a single driver can handle a wide variety of devices from multiple manufacturers. Or it would have, if there weren&#x27;t actual device manufacturers involved.”<br>

One does not need BPF to transform devices into something new, that is easily done from userspace. All that you need to do is to run a daemon that grabs the original device and creates new virtual device, you can get the idea from <a href="https://github.com/metan-ucw/evfilter">https://github.com/metan-ucw/evfilter</a><br>

I'd rather not need letMeTypeThings.d to be running if I want to work on my computer.  In a recovery shell, letMeTypeThings.d might not get started, for instance.<br>

I fail to see how that is different from let_me_type.bpf not loaded before executing recovery shell. Either you have drivers and workarounds compiled in the kernel or not in which case they may fail to load.<br>

Oh I want this so badly! The mouse I have is wonky either electrically or in firmware, and will occasionally smack the pointer into a random screen corner even when I&#x27;m nowhere near the computer. I have to unplug the thing overnight or else it wakes the monitor up at 4am.<br>

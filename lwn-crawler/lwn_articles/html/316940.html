<p>
A new security module, called <a
href="http://www.synack.fr/project/snet/snet.html">snet</a> (which is short
for "security for network syscalls") was recently <a
href="/Articles/316939/">posted as an RFC</a> on the linux-security-module
mailing list.  Its purpose is rather simple&mdash;much simpler than the 
two current mainline users of the LSM interface&mdash;intercept system calls for
networking and call out to user space to determine if they are to be
allowed.  The idea is to be able to create Linux versions of the "personal
firewall" that is popular on Windows machines.  Reaction to snet was mixed,
partially because of a disdain for that type of security tool, but also
because it is implemented using LSM.
</p>

<p>
Snet, developed by Samir Bellabes, consists of a kernel piece which
uses LSM 
to hook the "interesting" 
socket-related system calls (<tt>socket()</tt>, <tt>bind()</tt>,
<tt>connect()</tt>, <tt>listen()</tt>, and <tt>accept()</tt>), as well as a
user space library that can be 
used to accept or deny those calls.  Communication between the kernel
and user space is handled by a netlink socket using libnl.  The decisions
are then cached in the kernel to reduce the
number of calls 
required to user space.  That last part is important because
personal firewalls typically pop up a request on the user's display asking
them to decide whether to allow the system call.  Timeouts can
be established for the user-space calls, along with a default response if
the timeout is reached.
</p>

<p>
This "user request" feature of personal firewalls is one thing that many
find objectionable.  As Paul Moore <a href="/Articles/317017/">puts it</a>:
"<q>my opinion is that it is a poor option for security and typically
only results in training  
the user to click the 'allow' button when the pfwall [dialog] box pops 
up on his/her screen</q>".  Yet it is a "feature" of other operating
systems and not completely unreasonable for Linux to support.  From that
perspective, snet seems like a reasonable starting point.
</p>

<p>
There are a few other problems, though, stemming from the decision to use
the LSM API.  Peter Dolding <a href="/Articles/317018/">seems to think</a>
this capability should be added to netfilter, rather than built as a
standalone solution.  Others pointed out that netfilter is sufficiently
low-level that any context about users or processes that are performing
these operations is not available.  That could change, but it would take
a concerted effort to change the netfilter code, which doesn't seem likely
near-term, if ever.
</p>

<p>
A larger problem comes from the inability to stack LSM modules.  If a user
is interested in the kinds of protection that snet can provide,  they must
forgo any other LSM-implemented security solution (i.e. SELinux, Smack,
AppArmor, TOMOYO, etc.).  A <a href="/Articles/317020/">parallel
discussion</a> about LSM stacking is also occurring on
linux-security-module, partially motivated by the needs of snet and other
"smaller" security solutions.  Those tools do not implement a full-scale
security solution <i>a la</i> SELinux or Smack, but instead try to handle a
smaller 
subset of the problem.
</p>

<p>
LSM stacking also came up at the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/315974/">LCA
security panel</a>, so it is certainly on the minds of Linux security
developers.  Casey Schaufler <a href="/Articles/316947/">sums up</a> the
current state of affairs along with a look to a possible future:
<div class="BigQuote">
Stacking of special purpose LSMs would be a great idea.
One reason that we don't have special purpose LSMs is that
you can't stack them, you have to provide the entire "solution"
in the one LSM. Of course, complete solutions don't stack.
<p>
I would be very interested to see an LSM that does nothing
but multiplex other LSMs. That would make multiple unrelated
LSMs feasible without trying to create something that could
deal with SELinux's and Smack's different notions of network
access control model. You could revive the notion of loadable
modules while you're at it. The LSM Multiplexer LSM could put
any restrictions on the LSMs it is willing to support.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It seems likely that someone will try to build an LSM-multiplexer before
too long.  In addition to snet, the <a
href="http://tuxguardian.sourceforge.net/">TuxGuardian</a> project appears
to be reawakening after a period of quiet.  It is similar to snet, and also
uses LSM to trap network accesses.  Other projects are also mentioned in
the threads on linux-security-module.  In the end, it is just too limiting
to require that all security modules implement a full-scale security
solution, and since LSM is the only accepted way to implement some of these
hooks, some middle ground will likely be found.
</p>

<p>
In another related <a href="/Articles/317022/">thread</a>, Schaufler <a
href="/Articles/317023/">notes</a> that a lot of what is being described
for personal firewalls could be implemented using SELinux&mdash;at least as
a starting point.  One sticking point to that particular solution is the
user interaction required.  It is hard to see how an SELinux-derived
solution could interact with the user for some decisions, but not others.
It also is clearly outside of the scope of what SELinux is intended for.
</p>

<p>
While snet may implement "bad security" in some minds, the discussion about
it, especially with regard to LSM stacking has been very valuable.  It may
turn out that there is no sane way to stack arbitrary security modules in a
way that a) makes sense and b) doesn't drive all of the security developers
insane.  But there are some reasonable use cases for that capability so it
would seem that an investigation of those possibilities is warranted.  With
luck we will soon see where it leads.

Stacking is NOT a new idea.  Back in 2002 I developed a small stacker for LSM as it existed at the time (<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/misc/stacker.c">http://www.dwheeler.com/misc/stacker.c</a>).<br>
<p>
Serge E. Hallyn took up the idea and ran with it.  His work is here:<br>

LSM stacking still makes sense.  Sure, there are cases where you can't reasonably combine components, but it's still useful.<br>

Interestingly a few years ago I started work on a more general framework to allow userspace to allow / deny different security decisions using the LSM API called PULSE: A Pluggable User-space Linux Security Environment - and to demo the framework I implemented a basic personal firewall - so this looks quite similar to that. When doing this work I also identified similar concerns to those raised about snet (ie. training users to just click allow) - more info is available in the following paper: <a href="http://crpit.com/abstracts/CRPITV81Murray.html">http://crpit.com/abstracts/CRPITV81Murray.html</a> - source is online at sourceforge: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pulse-lsm/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pulse-lsm/</a><br>
<p>
Unfortunately I haven't been able work on this since then so its a bit outdated but some of the ideas could be useful for the snet developer and for others developing custom LSM modules.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, I believe the ability to stack LSM modules would greatly improve their adoption, this way you could have a number of modules which each do one thing well - ie. AppArmor for file access control and perhaps snet for network access control, rather than trying to have something like SELinux for everything.<br>

One more comment about PULSE - the thing I want to emphasise is this is a general framework for allowing normal users to exercise mandatory access controls over their own processes, and so it is much more flexible than all the existing frameworks (SELinux, AppArmor, SMACK etc) which only allow the system administrator to define access controls for ALL users. PULSE allows different users to give their applications different permissions, since it is user-specific, and user-centric. It is also highly dynamic (allowing decisions to be made on the fly and also revoked on the fly), compared to SELinux etc which are based upon static security policies - hence it is much more oriented to desktop usage compared to SELinux etc which are more suited to servers which perform well-defined, static operations.<br>

LWN's <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2008/">2008 Kernel Summit coverage</a>
</div>
Your editor got talked into kicking off the kernel summit discussion on
documentation; if this coverage is sketchier than usual, it's because it's
hard to try to lead a discussion and take notes at the same time.  After
some of the obligatory introductory notes on how documentation is always a
problem, it was asked: how many kernel developers had actually gotten
something useful from the in-tree documentation directory recently?  Almost
all attendees raised their hands.  There is value, it seems, in the
documentation which is available now.
<p>
That said, there are also traps.  An aspiring camera driver author would,
upon exploring the documentation directory, stumble across a detailed file
describing just how those drivers should be written.  The author is Alan
Cox, who might be considered to be a reasonably authoritative source.  But
this document describes the deprecated Video4Linux1 API; if our author
wrote a new driver to that API, he or she would probably feel a little
misled once the initial reviews came back.  The value of that document in
2008 is probably negative.
<p>
There are plenty of equally musty documents in the kernel documentation tree.  The
real problem is that documentation has no subsystem maintainer, nobody who
will clean out the old stuff.  The legendary lack of organization in that
directory is also a result of a lack of overall maintenance.
<p>
The question that was put to the developers was: what do you want from
kernel documentation?  
Linus had a clear answer; what he wants is better release
notes for each kernel version.  It's not clear how to get there; maybe some
sort of automated way of finding descriptions of new features in the git
changelogs.  What's even less clear is how this work could improve on the
<a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges">high-quality work</a> done
over at the kernelnewbies.org site.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox asked for some quality control on documentation
submissions.  He noted, in particular, that the coding style document would
appear to have drifted from its original intent over the years.
<p>
One useful form of documentation that developers would like to see more of
is test programs for new features.  Test code for new system calls is
especially useful; it describes how the system call should work, and allows
architecture maintainers to verify that they have connected things up
properly.
<p>
There were questions on how much of the supplied kernel documentation is
truly useful; maybe much of it should be removed?  There are some obviously
useful files, like those describing kernel boot and tuning parameters.  The
KernelDoc documents have their value; much of that documentation appears in
the code itself, and the KernelDoc code checks to make sure that the
documentation matches the associated function definitions.  Much of the
rest tends to be out of date and unused.  
<p>
One result of the discussion might be an effort to remove some of the
oldest, most fictional documentation.  Beyond that, though, it looks mostly
like business as usual.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I found Rob Landley's paper "Where Linux kernel documentation hides" to be a very interesting read.  It's a shame his fellowship was discontinued.<br>

Many of the documentation files (such as the mentioned v4l1 <br>
documentation) would be vastly improved by a simple two-liner at the very <br>
top, saying "This document was written on yyy (date).  It was <br>
checked for accuracy by xxx on yyy."<br>
<p>
So if our hypothetical webcam driver author tries to use this document and <br>
sees that it was written in 2004, he at least should do careful checking <br>
if this still describes the state of the art.<br>

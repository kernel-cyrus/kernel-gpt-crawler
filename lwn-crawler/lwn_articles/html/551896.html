The Linux kernel manages sparse sets of index ranges for various subsystems. For
instance, the I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) keeps track of the
addresses of outstanding device memory mappings for each 
PCIE device's domain and tracks holes for new allocations. File systems cache
pending operations, extent state, free extents, and more. A simple linked
list fails to provide good performance for search, insertion, and
deletion operations as it grows, so more advanced abstract data types like
<a href="/Articles/184495/">red-black trees</a> (rbtrees) were implemented. The
kernel's rbtrees generally provide good performance as long as they are only
being accessed by one reader/writer, but they suffer when multiple readers and
writers are contending for locks.
<p>
There are variants of rbtrees that allow efficient
<a href="/Articles/262464/">read-copy-update (RCU)</a> based reads, but not fine-grained
concurrent writes. So, Chris Mason of Btrfs fame is developing a
<a href="/Articles/549470/">skiplist implementation</a> that will allow file systems like Btrfs
and XFS to perform many concurrent updates to their extent indexes. 
This article will describe the basic skiplist and what makes this skiplist variant
cache-friendly. In part two, I'll describe the skiplist API and compare the
performance of skiplists to rbtrees.
<p>
<h4>Basic skiplist</h4>
<p>
William Pugh first described skiplists in 1990 as a probabilistic alternative
to balanced trees (such as rbtrees) that is simpler, faster, and more
space-efficient. A skiplist is composed of a hierarchy of ordered linked lists, where 
each higher level contains a sparser subset of the list below it. The size of
the skiplist decreases at a constant rate for each higher level. For instance,
if level zero has 32 elements and a probability <em>p</em>=0.5 that an element
appears in the next higher level, then level one has 16 elements, level two has eight,
etc. The subset selected for the next higher level is random, but the quantity
of items in the subset isn't random.
<p>
By way of analogy, consider an old-fashioned printed dictionary with multiple
search aids built into it. This diagram shows how the different aids are similar
to levels of a skiplist:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/skiplist/basicskiplist-dict.png" width=646
height=140 alt="[Skiplist diagram]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
At the highest level there are grooves on the edge
of the book that mark sections for each letter, A-Z. The search can continue by
looking at word prefixes centered at the top of each page. Next, guide
words at the top left and right of 
each page show the span of words for each page. At the lowest level, a page is
scanned word by word.  
A skiplist replicates something like this index structure in a digital form.
<p>
<h4>History of kernel skiplists</h4>
<p>
Josh MacDonald investigated
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/skiplist/">cache-friendly skiplists</a>
on Linux 2.4 more than a decade ago. His skiplists are more space-efficient than 
rbtrees with more than 100 keys, searches are faster after 1,000 keys, and 
deletions and insertions at 10,000 keys. He also performed various concurrency 
experiments. When Josh posted an
<a href="http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0109.2/1067.html">RFC to
the kernel mailing list</a> he presented them as a "<q>solution waiting for
the right problem to come along</q>". At the time, no discussion ensued, but
Chris later became aware of Josh's work during his research.
Unfortunately, Josh's implementation focused on reader/writer locks, which only
allow one writer at a time, and Chris told me that he wanted to use RCU.
Also, Josh's coding style differs from the kernel's and his macros make his code
a little difficult to work with.
<p>
Other well-known Linux kernel developers have experimented with skiplists
as well. Con
Kolivas initially thought they would be useful for his 
<a href="/Articles/460430/">BFS CPU scheduler</a>. Ultimately, 
<a
href="http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/2011/10/bfs-0413-bfs-benchmarks-and-more-cksort.html">BFS
experienced worse behavior in general when using skiplists</a>,
so Con returned to his previous list structure.
This was due in part to the BFS scheduler's common case of having few tasks to
schedule, so it didn't benefit from theoretically faster lookups for larger
numbers of items in the list. Also, the scheduler process wasn't parallel
itself, so it didn't benefit from a skiplist's  more easily exploited concurrency.
<p>
Andi Kleen recalled the discouraging results from his own
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1194885/focus=1194892">skiplist
investigation</a> to Con. He found that the variable number of pointers needed 
to link different levels of a skiplist made it difficult to achieve efficient
use of memory and cache without limiting the size of the skiplist.
<p>
In 2011, Chris asked Liu Bo to try replacing Btrfs's rbtree-based
<tt>extent_map</tt> code, which maps logical file offsets to physical disk
offsets, with a skiplist-based implementation. The mappings are
read-mostly, until a random write workload triggers 
a copy-on-write operation. Liu created an
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/15150">initial skiplist
patch for Btrfs</a> beginning with Con's implementation and adding support for
concurrency with RCU. Results were mixed, and Chris's user-space experimentation
led him to start work to make Liu's skiplists more cache-friendly.
<p>
You may be saying to yourself, "I thought the whole point of Btrfs was to use
B-trees for everything." Btrfs does use its copy-on-write B-trees for any
structure read from or written to the disk. However, it also uses rbtrees for
in-memory caches. Some rbtrees batch pending inode and extent operations.
Other caches are: the extent state cache &mdash; tracking whether extents are
locked, damaged, dirty, etc.; the free space cache &mdash; remembering free
extents for quicker allocations; and the previously mentioned <tt>extent_map</tt>.
In addition to the rbtrees, a radix tree manages the extent buffer cache,
which is used like the page cache, but for blocks of metadata that might be larger
than a page.
<p>
All of these data structures have multiple threads contending for access to them
and might benefit from skiplists, though the delayed operation trees and free
space cache have the most contention. However, Chris's real target for this
skiplist is some pending RAID5/6 parity logging code. It needs to enable
"fast concurrent reads and writes into an exception store with new
locations for some extents." Ideally, Chris hopes to make his skiplist
general purpose enough for others to use. If skiplists can provide lockless
lookups and be used for both buffer cache indexes and extent trees, then
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems/74051/focus=74069">
Dave Chinner would consider using them in XFS</a>.
<p>
<h4>Cache-friendly skiplist</h4>
<p>
When reading the following description of Chris Mason's skiplist implementation, keep in mind
that it is a skiplist for range indexes, or extents. The extents being managed
are not identified by a single number. Each has an index/key pointing to its
beginning and a range/size. Furthermore, each element of the skiplist is
composed of multiple extents, which will be referred to as slots.
<p>
This new implementation of a cache-friendly skiplist is a bit more
complicated than the picture of the basic skiplist may suggest; it is best
examined in pieces.  The first of those pieces is described by this
diagram (a subset of <a href="/Articles/552088/">the full data structure
diagram</a>):
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/skiplist/cacheskiplist-head.png" width=477
height=351 alt="[skiplist head]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>

This figure shows a skiplist anchored by an <tt>sl_list</tt> structure
pointing to the initial entry (represented by <tt> struct sl_node</tt>) in
the list. That <tt>sl_node</tt> structure has an array of pointers (called
<tt>ptrs</tt>), indexed by level, to the head <tt>sl_node_ptr</tt>
structures of each skiplist level.  The <tt>sl_node_ptr</tt> structure
functions like a typical kernel <tt>list_head</tt> structure, except that
each level's head <tt>sl_node_ptr-&gt;prev</tt> is used, possibly
confusingly, to point to the item with the greatest key at that level of
the skiplist. All locking is done at the <tt>sl_node</tt> level and will be
described in part two of this article.

<p>
The skiplist grows from the head <tt>sl_node_ptr</tt> array on the right of
the diagram above
into an array of linked lists as shown below:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/skiplist/cacheskiplist-node_ptr.png" width=349
height=380 alt="[skiplist node pointers]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that none of the structures listed so far contain any keys or
data, unlike traditional skiplists. That's because Chris's skiplist items 
are associated with more than one key.

Another difference is that previous skiplist implementations lack <tt>prev</tt>
pointers. Pugh's original skiplist didn't need something like <tt>prev</tt>
pointers because it didn't support concurrency. MacDonald's skiplist does
support concurrency, but its protocol uses context structures that combine
parent/child pointer information with lock states. Mason's skiplists use a
different concurrency protocol that uses <tt>prev</tt> pointers.
<p>
A superficial difference between this skiplist and others is its apparent lack
of <tt>down</tt> pointers (allowing movement from one level of index to the
next), although they exist as the <tt>ptrs[]</tt> array
in <tt>sl_node</tt>. While the pointer array name is unimportant, its position
is, because different level nodes are created with different sizes of arrays.
See the <tt>ptrs</tt> array at the end of <tt>sl_node</tt> and <tt>sl_node</tt>
at the end of <tt>struct sl_leaf</tt> (which holds the actual leaf data):
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2013/skiplist/cacheskiplist-leaf.png" width=451
height=478 alt="[Skiplist leaf]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
The variable size of nodes could
cause memory fragmentation if they were allocated from the same pool of memory,
so Chris designed his skiplist with one slab cache for each level. This
effectively addresses Andi Kleen's concerns mentioned earlier regarding wasting
memory while keeping good performance.
<p>
The way in which keys are handled is cache-friendly in a couple of ways. First,
keys are not associated directly with individual items in this skiplist, but each
leaf manages a set of keys. <tt>SKIP_KEYS_PER_NODE</tt> is currently set to 32
as a balance between increasing cache hits and providing more chances for
concurrency. Second, an <tt>sl_leaf</tt> contains an array of <tt>keys</tt>.
Technically a <tt>keys</tt> array is unnecessary, since the keys are part of
the slots linked to a leaf. However, a search only needs the <tt>keys</tt> and
not the rest of the <tt>sl_slot</tt> structures until the end of the search. So,
the array helps skiplist operations avoid thrashing the cache.
<p>
Each <tt>sl_slot</tt> is an extent defined by its <tt>key</tt> and <tt>size</tt>
(index range). A developer can adapt the skiplist for their own use by embedding
<tt>sl_slot</tt> into their own data structure. The job of reference counting
belongs to the container of <tt>sl_slot</tt>.
<p>
See <a href="/Articles/552088/">the full diagram</a> for a picture of how
all the pieces described above fit together.
With 32 keys per item, a maximum level of 32, and half the
number of items in each higher level, Chris's skiplist should be able to
efficiently manage around 137 billion extents (index ranges).
<p>
The statistically balanced nature of the skiplist allows it to handle sparse
sets of indexes in such a way that modifications avoid the need for an rbtree's
rebalancing operations, and so they lend themselves to simpler concurrency
protocols. Chris also designed his skiplist to be cache-friendly by
having each element represent a set of keys/slots, keeping duplicates of
the slot's keys in an array, and creating a slab cache for each level of
the skiplist. 
Part two of this series will offer a description of the skliplist API and a
discussion of the performance of skiplists vs. rbtrees.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

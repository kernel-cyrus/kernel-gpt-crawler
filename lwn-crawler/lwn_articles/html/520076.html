           </div>
The Linux kernel's software interrupt ("softirq") mechanism is a bit of a
strange beast.  It is an obscure holdover from the earliest days of Linux
and a mechanism that few kernel developers ever deal with directly.  Yet it
is at the core of much of the kernel's most important processing.
Occasionally softirqs make their presence known in undesired ways; it is
not surprising that the kernel's frequent problem child — the realtime
preemption patch set — has often run afoul of them.  Recent versions of
that patch set embody a new approach to the software interrupt problem that
merits a look.
<p>
<h4>A softirq introduction</h4>
<p>
In the announcement for the <a href="/Articles/518993/">3.6.1-rt1</a> patch
set, Thomas Gleixner described software interrupts this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	First of all, it's a conglomerate of mostly unrelated jobs, which
     	run in the context of a randomly chosen victim w/o the ability to
     	put any control on them.

</blockquote>
<p>
The softirq mechanism is meant to handle processing that is almost — but
not quite — as important as the handling of hardware interrupts.  Softirqs
run at a high priority (though with an interesting exception, described
below), but with 
hardware interrupts enabled.  They thus will normally preempt any work
except the response to a "real" hardware interrupt.
<p>
Once upon a time, there were 32 hardwired software interrupt vectors, one
assigned to each device driver or related task.  Drivers have, for the most
part, been detached from software interrupts for a long time — they still
use softirqs, but that access has been laundered through intermediate APIs
like tasklets and timers.  In current kernels there are ten softirq vectors
defined; two for tasklet processing, two for networking, two for the block
layer, two for timers, and one each for the scheduler and read-copy-update
processing.  The kernel maintains a per-CPU bitmask indicating which
softirqs need processing at any given time.  So, for example, when a kernel
subsystem calls <tt>tasklet_schedule()</tt>, the <tt>TASKLET_SOFTIRQ</tt>
bit is set on the corresponding CPU and, when softirqs are processed, the
tasklet will be run.
<p>
There are two places where software interrupts can "fire" and preempt
the current thread.  One of them is at the end of the processing for a hardware
interrupt; it is common for interrupt handlers to raise softirqs, so it
makes sense (for latency and optimal cache use) to process them as soon as
hardware interrupts can be 
re-enabled.  The other possibility is anytime that kernel code re-enables
softirq processing (via a call to functions like <tt>local_bh_enable()</tt>
or <tt>spin_unlock_bh()</tt>).  The end result is that the accumulated
softirq work (which can be substantial) is executed in the context of
whichever process happens to be running at the wrong time; that is the
"randomly chosen victim" aspect that Thomas was talking about.
<p>
Readers who have looked at the process mix on their systems may be wondering
where the <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> processes fit into the picture.  These
processes exist to offload softirq processing when the load gets too heavy.
If the regular, inline softirq processing code loops ten times and still
finds more softirqs to process (because they continue to be raised), it
will wake the appropriate <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> process (there is one per CPU)
and exit; that process will 
eventually be scheduled and pick up running softirq handlers.
<tt>Ksoftirqd</tt> will
also be poked if a softirq is raised outside of (hardware or software)
interrupt context; that is necessary because, otherwise, an arbitrary
amount of time might pass before softirqs are processed again.  In older
kernels, the <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> processes ran at the lowest possible priority,
meaning that softirq processing was, depending on where it is being run,
either the 
highest priority or the lowest priority work on the system.  Since 2.6.23,
<tt>ksoftirqd</tt> runs at normal user-level priority by default.
<p>
<h4>Softirqs in the realtime setting</h4>
<p>
On normal systems, the softirq mechanism works well enough that there has
not been much motivation to change it, though, as described in "<a
href="/Articles/518953/">The new visibility of RCU processing</a>,"
read-copy-update work has been moved into its own helper threads for the
3.7 kernel.  In the realtime world, though, the concept of forcing
arbitrary processes to do random work tends to be unpopular, so the
realtime patches have traditionally pushed all softirq processing into
separate threads, each with its own priority.  That allowed, for example,
the priority of network softirq handling to be raised on systems where
networking needed realtime response; conversely, it could be lowered on
systems where response to network events was less critical.
<p>
Starting with the 3.0 realtime patch set, though, that capability went away.  It
worked less well with the <a href="/Articles/452884/">new approach to
per-CPU data</a> adopted then, and, as Thomas said, the per-softirq threads
posed configuration problems:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	It's extremely hard to get the parameters right for a RT system in
     	general. Adding something which is obscure as soft interrupts to
     	the system designers todo list is a bad idea.
</div>
<p>
So, in 3.0, softirq handling looked very similar to how things are done in
the mainline kernel.  That improved the code and increased performance on
untuned systems (by eliminating the context switch to the softirq thread),
but took away the ability to finely tweak things for those 
who were inclined to do so.  And realtime developers tend to be highly
inclined to do just that.  The result, naturally, is that some users
complained about the changes.
<p>
In response, in 3.6.1-rt1, the handling of softirqs has changed again.
Now, when a thread raises a softirq, the specific interrupt in question
(network receive processing, say) is remembered by the kernel.  As soon as
the thread exits the context where software interrupts are disabled, that
one softirq (and no others) will be run.  That has the effect of minimizing
softirq latency (since softirqs are run as soon as possible); just as 
importantly, it also ties
processing of softirqs to the processes that generate them.  A process
raising networking softirqs will not be bogged down processing some other
process's timers.  That keeps the work local, avoids nondeterministic
behavior caused by running another process's softirqs, and causes softirq
processing 
to naturally run with the priority of the process creating the work in the
first place.
<p>
There is an exception, of course: softirqs raised in hardware interrupt
context cannot be handled in this way.  There is no general way to
associate a hardware interrupt with a specific thread, so it is not
possible to force the responsible thread to do the necessary processing.
The answer in this case is to just hand those softirqs to the
<tt>ksoftirqd</tt> process and be done with it.
<p>
A logical next step, hinted at by Thomas, is to move from an environment
where all softirqs are disabled to one where only specific softirqs are.  Most
code that disables softirq handling is only concerned with one specific
handler; all the others could be allowed to run as usual.  Going further,
he adds: "<q>the nicest solution would be to get rid of them
completely.</q>"  The elimination of the softirq mechanism has been on
the "todo" list for a long time, but nobody has, yet, felt the pain
strongly enough to actually do that work.  
<p>
The nature of the realtime patch set has often been that its users feel the
pain of mainline kernel shortcomings before the rest of us do.  That has
caused a great many mainline fixes and improvements to come from the realtime
community.  Perhaps that will eventually happen again for softirqs.  For
the time being, though, realtime users have an improved softirq mechanism
that should give the desired results without the need for difficult
low-level tuning.  Naturally, Thomas is looking for people to test this
change and report back on how well it works with their workloads.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

On a multicore box, wouldn't it be easier just to dedicate a whole CPU core, 100% of the time to a particular process? In many of the RT use-cases I can think of, there's one task (often a single-threaded C-program) that needs to be able to run at top priority without interruption, while the entire rest of the OS, userspace and GUI could happily fit into the remaining cores.<br>
<p>
Maybe I'm oversimplifying this, and it's certainly a bit wasteful (and won't work well for embedded), but for many common cases, such as low-latency audio processing, or avoiding dropouts, or data-acquistion, it would work just fine!<br>
<p>
RT is hard when you have a mostly busy CPU (especially single-core), and multiple tasks, which might be relatively lightweight, require their small slice of CPU with hard-constraints on timing. But often, this isn't the case: we have just one critical task, and the system is mostly idle.<br>

because it's really rare that your real time processing only needs to do computation on data it already has. Usually you need to do other things besides computation (like I/O of the audio, disk, etc)<br>
<p>
At that point you are interacting with the rest of the system and you need to worry about delays and locking in the rest of the kernel.<br>

Intel's networking fastpath basically just throws power consumption out the window and dedicates entire cpu cores to spinning on the network devices.  <br>
<p>
100% cpu usage, constantly, but you get really low-latency networking!<br>
<p>
A somewhat less intrusive method is to direct only the interrupts you care about to the "isolated" cpu while leaving all the rest to be handled as normal.<br>

Remember it`s not always about feeling pain, but about praising God.<br>
Excellence and brilliance will usually do that.<br>

This theospammer has it so very wrong. Realtime developers spend so very much more time cursing than praising anything.<br>

Wow! I though just a moment I witnessed the creation of a new word there: Theospammer. It completely describes the person writing the silly, inappropriate and mostly, at least to me, very surprising comment above.<br>
Really! I mean I read the theospam about ten times before I realized it really could only be that, and not some very deep thoughtful and witty comment.<br>
<p>
Of course Theospammer wasn't a new word at all, apparently I don't read discussion groups enough. Still, what a beautiful word!<br>

Well, I'd never seen the word before either. It's a fairly obvious portmanteau.<br>

"Now, when a thread raises a softirq, the specific interrupt in question (network receive processing, say) is remembered by the kernel"<br>
<p>
Could you provide an example of syscll that trig a softirq ? For the network, for instance, i suppose that only calls that provide data to the kernel trig a soft irq (send, write, etc) ? But, i hardly imagine what kind of notification can trig a receive processing.<br>
<p>
Regards.<br>

I am really confused with the usage of spin_lock_bh and spin_lock .. A simpler article would really help NOVICE to understand the various contexts available in Linux and how to protect data when executing in those contexts<br>

<a href="/Articles/740157/">BPF in the kernel</a>
</div>
The BPF virtual machine is working its way into an increasing number of
kernel subsystems.  <a href="/Articles/742082/">The previous article in
this series</a> introduced the BPF Compiler Collection (BCC), which
provides a set of tools for working with BPF.  But there is more to BCC
than a set of administrative tools; it also provides a development
environment for those wanting to create their own BPF-based utilities.
Read on for an exploration of that environment and how it can be used to
create programs and attach them to tracepoints.

<p>The BCC runtime provides a macro, <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#3-tracepoints"><tt>TRACEPOINT_PROBE</tt></a>,
that declares a function to be attached to a tracepoint
that will be called every time the tracepoint fires. The following snippet
of&nbsp;C
code shows an empty BPF program that runs every time <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is
called in the kernel:
<p>
<pre>
    TRACEPOINT_PROBE(kmem, kmalloc) {
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
<p>The arguments to this macro are the category of the tracepoint and the
event itself;
this translates directly into the debugfs file system hierarchy
layout
(e.g. <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/<i>category</i>/<i>event</i>/</tt>). In
true 
BCC-make-things-simple fashion, the tracepoint is automatically
enabled when the BPF program is loaded.

<p>The <tt>kmalloc()</tt> tracepoint is passed a number of arguments, which
are described in the associated <tt>format</tt>
file. Tracepoint arguments are accessible in BPF programs through the
magic <tt>args</tt> variable. For our example, we care about
<tt>args-&gt;call_site</tt>, which is the kernel instruction address of the
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> call.

To keep a count of the different kernel functions that call
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>, we can store a counter in a hash table and use the
call-site address as an index.
<p>

While BCC provides access to the full range of data structures exported
by the kernel (and covered in the first article of this series), the two
most frequently used are <tt>BPF_HASH</tt> and
<tt>BPF_TABLE</tt>. Fundamentally, all of BCC's data structures are maps,
and higher-level data structures are built on top of them; the most basic
of these is <tt>BPF_TABLE</tt>. The <tt>BPF_TABLE</tt> macro takes a type
of table (<tt>hash</tt>, <tt>percpu_array</tt>, or <tt>array</tt>) as an
argument, and other macros, such as <tt>BPF_HASH</tt> and
<tt>BPF_ARRAY</tt> are simply wrappers around <tt>BPF_TABLE</tt>.

Because all data structures are maps, they all support the same
core set of functions, including <tt>map.lookup()</tt>, <tt>map.update()</tt>,
and <tt>map.delete()</tt>. (There are also some map-specific functions such
as <tt>map.perf_read()</tt> for <tt>BPF_PERF_ARRAY</tt> and
<tt>map.call()</tt> for
<tt>BPF_PROG_ARRAY</tt>.)

<p>Returning to our example program, we can store the kernel
instruction-pointer address of the <tt>kmalloc()</tt> call-site (and the
number of 
times it was called) using a <tt>BPF_HASH</tt> map and post-process it with Python.
Here is the entire script, including the BPF program.
<p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from bcc import BPF
    from time import sleep

    program = """
        BPF_HASH(callers, u64, unsigned long);

        TRACEPOINT_PROBE(kmem, kmalloc) {
            u64 ip = args-&gt;call_site;
            unsigned long *count;
            unsigned long c = 1;

            count = callers.lookup((u64 *)&amp;ip);
            if (count != 0)
                c += *count;

            callers.update(&amp;ip, &amp;c);

            return 0;
        }
    """
    b = BPF(text=program)

    while True:
        try:
            sleep(1)
            for k,v in sorted(b["callers"].items()):
                print ("%s %u" % (b.ksym(k.value), v.value))
            print
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            exit()
</pre>

<p>The syntax for the <tt>BPF_HASH</tt> macro is described in the <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#2-bpf_hash">BCC
reference guide</a>.  The macro takes a number of optional arguments, but
for most uses all you need to specify is the name of this hash table
instance (<tt>callers</tt> in this example), the key data type
(<tt>u64</tt>), and the value data type 
(<tt>unsigned long</tt>).

BPF hash table entries are accessed using the <tt>lookup()</tt> function; if
no entry exists for a given key, NULL is returned. <tt>update()</tt> will
either insert a new key-value pair (if none exists) or update the
value of an existing key. Thus, the BPF code for working with hashes
can be quite compact because you can use a single function
(<tt>update()</tt>) regardless of whether you're inserting a new item or
updating an existing one.

<p>Once a count has been stored in the hash table, it can be processed with
Python. Accessing the table is done by indexing the BPF
object (called <tt>b</tt> in the example). The resultant Python object is a
<tt>HashTable</tt> (defined in the BCC 
Python front end) and its items are accessed using the <tt>items()</tt>
function. Note that <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps-1">Python
BCC maps</a> provide a different set of functions than <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">BPF
maps</a>.

<p><tt>items()</tt> returns a pair of <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_long">Python c_long
types</a> whose values can be retrieved using the <tt>value</tt>
member. For example, the following code from the example above iterates
over all items in the 
<tt>callers</tt> hash table and prints the kernel functions (using the BCC
<tt><a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#1-ksym">BPF.ksym()</a></tt>
helper function to convert kernel addresses to symbols) that invoked
<tt>kmalloc()</tt> and the number of calls:
<p>
<pre>
    for k,v in sorted(b["callers"].items()):
	print ("%s %u" % (b.ksym(k.value), v.value))
</pre>
<p>
The output from this little program looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    # ./example.py
    i915_sw_fence_await_dma_fence 4
    intel_crtc_duplicate_state 4
    SyS_memfd_create 1
    drm_atomic_state_init 4
    sg_kmalloc 7
    intel_atomic_state_alloc 4
    seq_open 504
    SyS_bpf 22
</pre>

<p>Though this example is relatively straightforward, larger tools will
not be, and developers need ways to debug more complex tools.
Thankfully, there are a few ways that BCC helps simplify the debugging
process.

<h4>Controlling BPF program compilation and loading</h4>

<p>Whenever a Python
<tt><a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#1-bpf">BPF</a></tt> 
object is instantiated, the BPF program source code contained within it is
automatically 
compiled and loaded into the kernel. The compilation process can be
controlled by passing compiler flag arguments in the <tt>cflags</tt>
parameter to the BPF class constructor. These flags are passed
directly to the Clang compiler, so any options that you might normally pass
to the compiler can be used; all compiler warnings can be turned on with
"<tt>cflags=['-Wall']</tt>", for instance.

<p>A popular use of <tt>cflags</tt> in the official BCC tools is to pass macro
definitions. For example, the
<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/networking/xdp/xdp_drop_count.py">xdp_drop_count.py</a>
script statically
allocates an array with enough space for every online CPU using
Python's <tt>multiprocessing</tt> library and Clang's <tt>-D</tt> flag:

<p>
<pre>
    cflags=["-DNUM_CPUS=%d" % multiprocessing.cpu_count()])
</pre>

<p>The BPF class constructor also accepts a number of <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/src/cc/bpf_module.h#L37">debugging
flags</a> in the <tt>debug</tt> argument. Each of these flags individually
enables extra logging during either the compilation or the loading
process. For example, the <tt>DEBUG_BPF</tt> flag causes the BPF bytecode to be
output, which can be a last hope for those really troublesome bugs.  This
output looks like:
<p>
<pre>
    0: (79) r1 = *(u64 *)(r1 +8)
    1: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -8) = r1
    2: (b7) r1 = 1
    3: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = r1
    4: (18) r1 = 0xffff8801a6098a00
    6: (bf) r2 = r10
    7: (07) r2 += -8
    8: (85) call bpf_map_lookup_elem#1
    9: (15) if r0 == 0x0 goto pc+3
     R0=map_value(id=0,off=0,ks=8,vs=8,imm=0) R10=fp0
    10: (79) r1 = *(u64 *)(r0 +0)
     R0=map_value(id=0,off=0,ks=8,vs=8,imm=0) R10=fp0
    11: (07) r1 += 1
    12: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = r1
    13: (18) r1 = 0xffff8801a6098a00
    15: (bf) r2 = r10
    16: (07) r2 += -8
    17: (bf) r3 = r10
    18: (07) r3 += -16
    19: (b7) r4 = 0
    20: (85) call bpf_map_update_elem#2
    21: (b7) r0 = 0
    22: (95) exit
    
    from 9 to 13: safe
    processed 22 insns, stack depth 16
</pre>

<p>This output comes directly from the in-kernel verifier and shows every
instruction of bytecode emitted by Clang/LLVM, along with the register
state on branch instructions. If this level of detail still isn't
enough, the <tt>DEBUG_BPF_REGISTER_STATE</tt> flag generates even more
verbose log messages.

<p>For run-time debugging, <tt>bpf_trace_printk()</tt> provides a
<tt>printk()</tt>-style 
interface for writing to <tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe</tt> from
BPF programs; those messages can then be consumed and printed in Python using
the <tt>BPF.trace_print()</tt> function.

<p>However, a major drawback of this approach is that, since the
<tt>trace_pipe</tt> file is a global resource, it contains all messages
written by concurrent writers, making it difficult to filter messages from a
single BPF program. The preferred method is to store messages in a <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#2-bpf_perf_output"><tt>BPF_PERF_OUTPUT</tt></a>
map inside the BPF program, then process them with
<tt><a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#2-open_perf_buffer">open_perf_buffer()</a></tt>
and
<tt><a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#1-kprobe_poll">kprobe_poll()</a></tt>.
An 
example of this scheme is provided in the <tt>open_perf_buffer()</tt>
documentation. 

<h4>Using BPF with applications</h4>

<p>This article has focused exclusively on attaching programs to kernel
tracepoints, but you can also attach programs to the user-space
tracepoints included with many popular applications using User
Statically-Defined Tracing (USDT) probes.

In the next and final article of this series, I'll cover the origin of
USDT probes, the BCC tools that use them, and how you can add them to
your own application.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

In terms of language (although that's probably not your question), there's bpftrace which is dtrace style syntax, but it also uses LLVM in the background though <br>
 (<a href="https://github.com/ajor/bpftrace">https://github.com/ajor/bpftrace</a>).<br>
<p>
Another project that allows for making it easier to run bcc on remote systems is bpfd which seems to be used by Android folks. It allows to run bcc on a remotely connected system without the need to have the entire LLVM infrastructure there. The announcement of the project was here <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/12/29/137">https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/12/29/137</a> (<a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd">https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd</a>). Perhaps this might rather be what you could be looking for wrt remote system.<br>

bpfd is a horrible hack.<br>
<p>
It just seems a waste to require the full LLVM machinery when the target is so simple and most scripts are trivial. A good old one-pass translator will probably be more than sufficient for most of users.<br>

Not to mention the specialized 8086 C compiler you'll get if you type "apt-get install bcc" on most Debian based systems. Which claims to be important for "the development of boot loaders or BIOS-related 8086 code".<br>

A mildly unfortunate overloading of TLAs at best.<br>

A good compiler in its day though.  Borland C++ was astounding, compared with the Microsoft C++ at the time - it was a decade or so (and a change of head of their C++ group) before Microsoft decided that any kind of standards compliance was worth aiming for.<br>

I think it was my first C++ compiler[1] (the Dev-C++ IDE), though mostly due to it being free and me being just a grade school student. I don't remember having bad experiences with it specifically, but it has not kept up with the times…<br>
<p>
[1]TI-GCC was probably my first C compiler.<br>

If you want a blast from the past, <a href="http://tvision.sf.net/">http://tvision.sf.net/</a> might be worth a look, or would be if *.sf.net wasn't down at the moment. (It's amazing how archaic it seems now, without having changed a bit.)<br>

Timely and relevant article, thank you, love to see more. The previous article helped me the same day it was published with  a kernel performance evaluation I was doing. I ended up running more than 6k KVM guests on a huge machine and got scheduling latency data using BCC. I spent most of my work time building LLVM for the linux distro I had to use, which is a variant of fedora. Once that task was finished, the hardest thing I had to do was to decide which particular tool of many was best to use. If anyone is on the fence because of the LLVM requirement, I would say go ahead, its worth it.<br>

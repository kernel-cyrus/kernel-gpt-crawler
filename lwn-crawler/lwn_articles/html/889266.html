           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 4, 2022</br>
           </div>
Linus Torvalds <a href="/Articles/890118/">released</a> the 5.18-rc1 kernel prepatch on
April&nbsp;3, after having pulled 13,207 non-merge changesets into the
mainline repository.  This merge window has thus not only been 
turbulent, with a significant number of regressions and refused pull
requests, it has also been relatively busy.  Just over 9,000 of those
changesets were pulled after <a href="/Articles/888736/">the first 5.18
merge window summary</a> was written; the time has come to catch up with
the remainder of changes merged for this development cycle.
<p>
The most interesting changes pulled in the latter part of the 5.18 merge
window include:
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Live patching is now supported for 32-bit PowerPC systems.

<li> The RISCV architecture has gained support for the "Sv57" page-table
     format.  This is a five-level format with support for 57-bit virtual
     addresses.
<li> The RISCV perf implementation has been ripped out and replaced with
     <a
     href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211225054647.1750577-1-atishp@rivosinc.com/">one
     based on the SBI PMU and Sscofpmf extensions</a>; that allows for 
     support of most perf features.
<li> The RISCV SBI CPU-idle extension is supported as of 5.18.
<li> RISCV has also gained support for <a
     href="/Articles/883104/">restartable sequences</a>.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/884876/">Intel software-defined silicon
     driver</a>, which allows Intel to control which features of a given
     processor can be used, has been merged.
<li> Support for AMD's "host system management port", which is "<q>an
     interface to provide OS-level software with access to system
     management functions via a set of mailbox registers</q>", has been
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/91f410aa679a">merged</a>.  A
     small amount of additional information can be found in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/402576d9804e">this documentation
     commit</a>.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The BPF type format (BTF) mechanism can now annotate variables that
     refer to user-space memory.  Among other things, this gives the
     verifier a better way to detect and check user-space memory accesses.
     See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/50fc9786b25c">this merge
     changelog</a> for more information.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/883454/">BPF program-packing memory
     allocator</a> has been merged; it allows for more efficient memory use
     in systems with a large number of loaded BPF programs.
<li> The <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt> <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
     command now works with <a href="/Articles/374424/">hugetlb</a> pages.
<li> There is a new <tt>madvise()</tt> operation,
     <tt>MADV_DONTNEED_LOCKED</tt>, which will (like
     <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt>) cause the reclaim of the indicated pages.
     Unlike <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt>, though, this operation even applies to
     pages that have been locked into memory; the pages are forced out, but
     their "locked" status does not change.  So if the affected pages are
     faulted back in, they will be locked again.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9457056ac426">This changelog</a>
     explains the reasoning behind this functionality.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Device-mapper I/O accounting has been significantly reworked,
     resulting in much more accurate accounting for targets like dm-crypt.
<li> The Reiserfs filesystem <a href="/Articles/886708/">has been
     deprecated</a> with an eye toward removal in 2025.
<li> Support for <a href="/Articles/638722/">write streams</a> has been
     removed from the block subsystem.  There are currently no devices
     supporting that functionality and no real prospect of any being added.
<li> 64-Bit integrity checksums on NVMe devices are now supported.
<li> The exfat filesystem has a new mount option (<tt>keep_last_dots</tt>)
     that will cause it to not strip trailing periods from file names; this
     makes the filesystem incompatible with Windows, which does strip
     trailing periods.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> As usual, the user-space perf tools have seen a long list of
     improvements; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7b58b82b86c8">this merge commit</a>
     for a summary.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The bridge subsystem now has support for multiple spanning trees;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/82e94d4144d7">this merge
     commit</a> for more information.
<li> The process of instrumenting the networking code to <a
     href="/Articles/885729/">expose the reason for packet drops</a>
     continues. 
<li> BPF programs attached to network control groups can now use
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4e950747ba12">a couple of new
     helper functions</a> to explicitly set the return value for system
     calls.  This enables the communication of better information about why
     a given system call was rejected.
<li> Packet transmission from BPF programs run with <tt>BPF_PROG_RUN</tt>
     is now supported.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/de55c9a1967c">this merge
     commit</a>, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b530e9e1063e">this
     changelog</a>, and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1a7551f15097">this documentation
     patch</a> for more information.
<li> Fragment support has been added to the <a
     href="/Articles/750845/">express data path (XDP)</a> mechanism,
     allowing the processing of jumbo frames and more.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a9921ce1cae5">this commit</a> for
     more information.
<li> The teardown of network namespaces has been significantly accelerated,
     which is important for some large systems with a lot of network traffic.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/864521/">strict <tt>memcpy()</tt> bounds
     checking patches</a> have been merged.  This work should help to catch
     a range of memory-safety problems before they ever make it into a
     production kernel.
<li> The kernel is now compiled with the <tt>-Warray-bounds</tt> and
     <tt>-Wzero-length-bounds</tt> warnings enabled.  This is the
     culmination of a long-term effort to eliminate zero-length arrays and
     related tricks from the kernel code.
<li> <a href="/Articles/889475/">indirect branch tracking</a> control-flow
     integrity has been 
     added for the x86 architecture.  This feature prevents indirect
     branches from being redirected to locations that were not intended as
     the target of such a branch.  Specifically, all indirect branches must
     land on an <tt>ENDBR</tt> instruction.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Virtualization and containers</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<Li> The <a
     href="https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/VirtioCrypto">virtio-crypto</a>
     device has gained support for encryption with RSA.  Documentation
     seems to be nonexistent, but <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/59ca6c93387d">this commit</a> may
     be comprehensible to somebody.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> As described in <a href="/Articles/885941/">this article</a>, the
     kernel is now compiled against the C11 language standard rather than
     C89.
<li> The new "fprobe" mechanism allows for quick function-call tracing when
     the full features of ftrace are not needed; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/aba09b44a985">this documentation
     commit</a> for more information.
<li> The build system now supports two new environment variables,
     <tt>USERCFLAGS</tt> and <tt>USERLDFLAGS</tt>; they can be used to pass
     additional options to the compiler and linker, respectively.
<li> There have been more significant changes to the internal support code
     for network filesystems; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f008b1d6e1e0">this merge
     changelog</a> for an overview.
<li> The long-deprecated PCI DMA API has been removed; drivers should be
     using the regular DMA API instead.
</ul>
<p>

The 5.18 kernel now moves into the stabilization phase, where the bugs that
inevitably crept in with all of those new features will (hopefully) be
found and fixed.  Assuming the normal schedule holds, the final 5.18
release can be expected on May&nbsp;22 or&nbsp;29.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Removal is &quot;ok we&#x27;re done it&#x27;s gone now hope you sorted out your migration don&#x27;t come crying to us if you wasted the whole migration window on futile pleas for us to change our mind&quot;.<br>

Well people are like water they always take the shortest route so they wont migrate until they have to and they wont have to until the relevant bits are removed and they are forced to update to a newer kernel that does not support those bits so you might just as well remove the bits at the same time they are considered deprecated.<br>

There should be no need for prolonged death or a deprecation window. <br>

Reiserfs is the sort of thing you either aren&#x27;t already using, or are deeply stuck using, and three years seems like a reasonable amount of time to make emergency plans to move off it.<br>

Well I would think that if an deprecation period truly is necessary it should never be longer than a single upstream longterm maintenance kernel release cycle meanwhile stable could immediately drop it. It should be safe to assume that anyone that is stuck on anything in the kernel is running an enterprise distro with paid support and that paid support arguably should be dealing with issues just like this and if demands are for it continue support it downstream, if not what else are those enterprise distro&#x27;s good for? <br>

What a brilliant idea. Now anyone updating to new stable kernels has to consider the possibility that their filesystems suddenly don&#x27;t work any more and all their data is inaccessible! What could possibly go wrong?<br>
<p>
(Seriously, you appear to be operating under the assumption that user data in old filesystems is utterly unimportant and can just be cavalierly deleted. The opposite is true: it&#x27;s probably both crucial, very hard to move, and largely disregarded, so a long deprecation period with loud warnings is essential.)<br>

No I&#x27;m operating under the assumption that no downstream users is still using Reiserfs which it&#x27;s development ceased years ago and if they are they must be on an distribution which has a long term support ( either paid or free ) or are using long term supported kernel which gives them enough time to make the necessary preparement for this change thus are unaffected by this change and the kernel community can immediately drop it as opposed to the kernel community giving mixed signals by continuing to ship it just like they have been doing for years while it&#x27;s development had ceased. <br>

Tangentially related to this whole thread: I recently discovered they&#x27;ve been removing NFSv2 support from the kernel and userspace.<br>
<p>
Said discovery came as an unpleasant surprise whereby my NAS (running only NFSv4 for years) failed to reboot properly and broke half my network, because suddenly &quot;--no-nfs-version 2&quot; on rpc.nfsd had gone from working to being a fatal syntax error. Adding to the fun, it&#x27;s still present and necessary on other tools...<br>

Ditto. libnfs 4 and 5 also broke, for reasons I don&#x27;t entirely understand given that it was using NFSv3 all along. (It ends up dereferencing null pointers and crashing. I switched to ordinary server-side client mounts. The problem went away in 5.16.19, it seems.)<br>

IOW, your assumption is based on the assumption that users have good knowledge of filesystems and would actively move away from old ones. I can assure you that far from the reality.<br>

<h1>Migration disable for the mainline</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 9, 2020</br>
           </div>
The realtime developers have been working for many years to
create a kernel where the highest-priority task is always able to run
without delay.  That has meant a long process of finding and fixing
situations where high-priority tasks might be blocked from running; one of
the persistent problems in this regard has been kernel code that disables
preemption.  One tool that the realtime developers have reached for is
disabling migration (moving a process from one CPU to another) rather than
preemption; this approach has not been entirely popular among scheduler
developers, though.  Even so, the solution would appear to be <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201023101158.088940906@infradead.org/">this
migration-disable patch set</a> from scheduler developer Peter Zijlstra.
<p>

One of the key scalability techniques used in the kernel is per-CPU data.
System-wide locking is an effective way of protecting shared data, but it
can kill performance in a number of ways, even if a given lock is itself not
heavily contested.  Any data structure that is only accessed by a single
CPU does not need to 
be protected by system-wide locks, avoiding this problem.
Thus, for example, the memory allocators maintain per-CPU lists
of available memory that can be handed out without interference from the
other CPUs on the system.  But kernel code can only safely manipulate
per-CPU data if it has exclusive access to the CPU; if some other process
is able to jump in, it could find (or create) inconsistent per-CPU data
structures.  The normal way to prevent this from happening is to disable
preemption when necessary; it is a cheap operation (setting a flag,
essentially) that ensures that a given task will not be interrupted until
its work is done.
<p>
Disabling preemption runs afoul of the goals of the realtime developers, who have put so
much work into ensuring that any given task <i>can</i> be interrupted if a
higher-priority task needs the CPU.  As they have worked to remove
preemption-disabled regions, they have observed that, often, all that is
really needed is to keep tasks from being moved between CPUs while they are
accessing per-CPU data, with perhaps some (normally CPU-local) locking as
well.  See, for example, the <a
href="/Articles/836144/"><tt>kmap_local()</tt> work</a>.  Disabling
migration still allows a process to be preempted, so it does not interfere
with the goals of the realtime project — or so those developers hope.
<p>
Disabling migration brings problems of its own, though.  The kernel's CPU
scheduler is tasked with making the best use of all of the CPUs in the
system.  If there are N CPUs available, they should be running the N
highest-priority tasks at any given time.  That goal cannot be achieved
without occasionally moving tasks between CPUs; it would be nice if tasks
just happened to land on the right processors every time, but the real
world is not like that.  Depriving the scheduler of the ability to migrate
tasks, even for brief periods,  thus takes away a tool that is crucial for
the overall behavior and throughput of the system.

</blockquote>
<p>
As a simple example of what can happen, consider a system with two CPUs and
two tasks, of which only the lower-priority task is runnable.  That task
enters a migration-disabled section at the same time that the high-priority
task becomes runnable on the same CPU.  The low-priority task will be duly
preempted so that the high-priority task can run.  That low-priority task
still needs CPU time, though, and meanwhile the other CPU is sitting idle.
Normally the scheduler would just migrate the low-priority task over to the
idle CPU and allow it to continue but, since that task has disabled
migration, it remains stuck and unable to run.  Migration disable thus
differs from preemption disable, which does not risk creating stuck
processes in this way.
<p>
So it is not entirely surprising that the migration-disable capability has
not been greeted with open arms by mainline scheduler developers.  Those
same developers, though (and Zijlstra in particular) understand what is
driving this work.  So, when Thomas Gleixner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200917094202.301694311@linutronix.de/">posted a
migration-disable patch set</a> in September, Zijlstra declined to apply
it, but he also went to work to create an alternative that would be
acceptable from a scheduling point of view — on realtime kernels, at least.
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201023102346.818170844@infradead.org/">patch</a>
adding the core machinery makes it clear in a leading comment that
the migration disable feature is "<q>(strongly) undesired</q>".  It goes on:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This is a 'temporary' work-around at best. The correct solution is getting
	rid of the above assumptions and reworking the code to employ explicit
	per-cpu locking or short preempt-disable regions.
<p>
	The end goal must be to get rid of migrate_disable(), alternatively we need
	a schedulability theory that does not depend on arbitrary migration.
</div>
<p>
There are a couple of particularly tricky areas when it comes to making
migration disable work properly.  One of those, naturally, is CPU hotplug,
which has <a href="/Articles/537562/">already shown itself to be a
difficult area</a> in the past.  If a CPU is to be removed from the system,
one should first migrate all running processes elsewhere to avoid the even
trickier problem of irate users.  But if some of those processes have
disabled migration, that cannot be immediately done.  So the hotplug
mechanism had to gain a count of how many tasks in each run queue have
disabled migration, and to wait until that number drops to zero.
<p>
Then, there is the issue of blocked tasks described above: there may be a
CPU available to run a lower-priority task that has been preempted, but the
disabling of migration prevents the task from moving to that available
CPU.  In a truly pathological situation, several preempted tasks could end
up stacked on a CPU and unable to migrate while most of the system remains
idle.  This sort of violation of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-conserving_scheduler">work
conservation</a> does not improve the mood of scheduler developers — and
they already have a reputation for grumpiness.
<p>
The approach taken to this problem is not a perfect solution (which may not
exist), but hopefully it helps.  If a CPU's run queue contains a task
that is runnable, but which has been preempted by a higher-priority task,
the normal response would be to try to migrate the preempted task
elsewhere.  If migration has been disabled, that cannot happen, obviously.
So the scheduler will try, instead, to migrate the running, higher-priority
task to get it out of the way.  That is not ideal; migration has its costs,
including the potential 
loss of cache locality, that will now be paid by the higher-priority task.
Or, as Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201023102347.499155098@infradead.org/">put it</a>:
"<q>This adds migration interference to the higher priority task, but
restores bandwidth to system that would otherwise be irrevocably
lost</q>". 
<p>
Finally, it's worth pointing out that migration disable will be limited to
kernels configured for realtime operation.  On everything else, a call to
<tt>migrate_disable()</tt> will
disable preemption, as is done now.  So behavior for most users will not
change, at least not directly.  But this is another important step toward
getting the realtime preemption patches fully migrated into the mainline
after all these years.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
That&#x27;s not entirely correct. Since the scheduler people solved the problem (at least to the extent it is solvable today) there is no real reason anymore to make this an RT only functionality.<br>
<p>
The proposed kmap_local() facility depends on the general availability of migrate_disable(). See: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/836144/">https://lwn.net/Articles/836144/</a> and especially the patch in this series which lifts that restriction: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201103095858.928160966@linutronix.de">https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201103095858.928160966@linutr...</a><br>
<p>
There are other valid reasons to expose the ability to disable migration without disabling preemption independent of RT.<br>

I think most everyone cares about throughput, eventually.  If your throughput isn’t high enough, you will eventually slip your real time commitments by not being able to get the work done, regardless of how you schedule it.  And if that’s not a problem in your setting, then you could probably use cheaper hardware (ie, you’ve got hardware capacity to waste) until, oops, it’s a problem again.<br>

<p>
The goal of the RT kernel is to improve latency, and this might be detrimental to throughput. You want your tasks to run on time with a good enough throughput which is not the same as running with the highest possible throughput while being late from time to time. <br>
<p>
You already have the ability to lock a thread on a particular logical CPU through the use of pthread_set_affinity_np(3). <br>

As jschrod said, the goal of RT is *deterministic* latency, not improved latency. If I wrote a patch that halved average latency, but doubled the maximum latency, the RT guys would laugh it out of court.<br>
<p>
If, however, I wrote a patch that made sure I could set a maximum latency of six months, and be confident it would be honoured, they&#x27;d be quite happy with that!<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; If a CPU&#x27;s run queue contains a task that is runnable, but which has been preempted by a higher-priority task, the normal response would be to try to migrate the preempted task elsewhere. If migration has been disabled, that cannot happen, obviously. So the scheduler will try, instead, to migrate the running, higher-priority task to get it out of the way.</font><br>

If, when a higher-priority task is being woken up, it will preempt a per-CPU data holding task, wouldn&#x27;t it be faster to wake it up directly on another CPU rather than on the same and trying to move it afterward ?<br>

The other CPU might only become available while the higher-priority task is already running and already has preempted the per-CPU data holding tasks.<br>

Why isn&#x27;t shielding a CPU core from the scheduler and putting the RT process on that core sufficient? High speed, latency sensitive processes are usually very tight loops that are deliberately made simple.  It is unusual to break these processes into multiple threads as that effects deterministic processing.  They may run as a polling loop with no scheduler at all in order to eliminate the latency hit from interrupts.<br>
<p>
This seems to be a solution for some middle-ground problem where low(er) latency is desired but the highest possible performance isn&#x27;t.  I can&#x27;t think of a particular use of this that would suit my needs better than assigning cores does now.<br>

Enabling preemption often yields lower latency, but that&#x27;s a side effect.<br>

There was a deadline scheduler, it would be a fair guarantee to run such latency guarantee RT tasks on a  deadline core, when they specify their requirements, the CPU local code can run in unallocated time, so long as these tasks can only demand a fractional utilisation.<br>
But I suspect that many of these RT systems are also embedded and they want to cheap out, when it comes to cores, rather than pay for the deterministic behaviour with spare compute. <br>
That&#x27;s the reason they want absolute priority over even critical OS tasks, attempting to export their problem for solution in other peoples code<br>

Hang on a cotton-pickin&#x27; minute ... !!!<br>
<p>
The WHOLE POINT of an embedded system is to run the APPLICATION. And if the OS can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t get out of the way, then it&#x27;s the OS&#x27;s fault!<br>
<p>
Why should a manufacturer (and hence tthe customer) have to pay extra for a super-duper system to run software they don&#x27;t even care about!<br>

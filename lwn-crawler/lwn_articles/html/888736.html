<h1>5.18 Merge window, part 1</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 25, 2022</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, 4,127 non-merge changesets have found their way into
the mainline repository for the 5.18 development cycle.  That may seem like
a relatively slow start to the merge window, but there are a lot of changes
packed into those commits.  Read on for a summary of the most
significant changes to land in the first half of the 5.18 merge window.
<br clear="all">
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> 32-Bit Arm systems have gained support for separate interrupt stacks
     and <a href="/Articles/692208/">virtually-mapped kernel stacks</a>. 
<li> Support for older Arm systems (ARMv4 and ARMv5) without a
     memory-management unit has been removed.  MMU-less support for
     ARMv7-M systems remains, though.
<li> The arm64 architecture supports the new "QARMA3"
     pointer-authentication algorithm.  This variant of Arm's QARMA
     is evidently faster while still being sufficiently secure.
<li> Arm64 systems can be built with shadow-stack support using the
     GCC&nbsp;12 compiler release.
<li> The PA-RISC architecture now has <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/df24e1783e6e">minimal vDSO
     support</a> which, in turn, enables the system to run with a
     non-executable stack for the first time.  The initial version of this
     patch was <a
     href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-parisc/4544A34A.6080700@tausq.org/">posted
     in 2006</a>; some things take longer than others to get into the
     mainline, it seems.
<li> Support for the Intel "hardware feedback interface" has been added.
     This mechanism allows the hardware to inform the kernel about the
     current performance and energy-efficiency capability of each CPU in
     the system.  These capabilities can change over time as the result of,
     for example, thermal constraints.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4a960e8941bd">This documentation
     patch</a> has some more information.
<li> Support for the nds32 architecture has been removed.  According to <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/194dfe88d62e">the merge
     changelog</a>:
     <p>
     <blockquote class="bq">
     The hardware is still used and the code is in reasonable shape, but
     the mainline port is not actively maintained any more, as all
     remaining users are thought to run vendor kernels that would never
     be updated to a future release.

<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/776703/">io_uring subsystem</a> has seen a
     number of improvements.  The new <tt>IORING_SETUP_SUBMIT_ALL</tt> option will
     cause a full batch of requests to be submitted even if an error is
     encountered partway through.  The file descriptors for the ring itself
     can be registered with the ring, providing a performance improvement
     for threaded applications; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e7a6c00dc77a">this changelog</a>
     for some details.  The new <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4f57f06ce218"><tt>IORING_OP_MSG_RING</tt>
     operation</a> allows one ring to signal another.  Finally, it is now
     possible to <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/adc8682ec690">perform the NAPI busy
     poll</a> on sockets directly from the ring.
<li> Support for the a.out executable format is no longer built by default
     for the alpha and m68k architectures — the last two that were still
     using it.  The a.out code has not actually been removed yet but <a
     href="/Articles/888741/">that is probably coming soon</a>.
<li> Some tweaks to the restartable-sequences API have been merged in
     preparation for <a href="/Articles/883104/">support in the GNU C
     Library</a>. 
<li> The <a href="/Articles/863753/">DAMON operation schemes</a> (DAMOS)
     mechanism gives user space more control over memory-management
     operations (and page reclaim in particular).
<li> The tracing system now supports "user events", which are essentially
     dynamic tracepoints in user-space applications.  The feature is
     described in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1bc191051dca">the merge changelog</a>
     as:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	User space can register an event with the kernel describing the
   	format of the event. Then it will receive a byte in a page mapping
   	that it can check against. A privileged task can then enable that
   	event like any other event, which will change the mapped byte to
   	true, telling the user space application to start writing the event
   	to the tracing buffer.
</blockquote>
<p>
     See the commits adding <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/864ea0e10cc9">documentation</a> 
     and <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c57eb4781509">a sample
     program</a> for more information.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The inline-encryption capabilities of block request queues can now
     be viewed in sysfs; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/20f01f163203">this changelog</a>
     for details.
<li> Direct I/O is not normally a possibility for encrypted files, since
     the data must be buffered through the kernel for encryption or
     decryption anyway.  If the hardware does the crypto work, though, the
     situation is different.  In 5.18, files encrypted with fscrypt can be
     accessed with direct I/O if <a href="/Articles/797309/">inline
     encryption</a> is in use.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/cdaa1b1941f6">This documentation
     patch</a> contains a little more information.
<li> The F2FS filesystem has gained support for <a
     href="/Articles/837566/">ID-mapped mounts</a>.
<li> Support for NFSv3 will always be built into the NFS server if NFS is
     enabled at all.  This is done with the intent of making NFSv3 become the base,
     "always-supported" version of NFS in preparation for the eventual
     removal of NFSv2 support.
<li> There are two new <tt>ioctl()</tt> operations for Btrfs
     (<tt>BTRFS_IOC_ENCODED_READ</tt> and <tt>BTRFS_IOC_ENCODED_WRITE</tt>)
     that allow direct reading from and writing to a file's extents.  The
     main use case for these commands is to support newer, more efficient
     send and receive operations.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>Hardware monitoring</b>:
     ASUS ACPI embedded controllers,
     Vicor PLI1209BC digital power supervisors,
     Aquacomputer Farbwerk 360 RGB controllers, and
     Texas Instruments TMP464 and TMP468 temperature sensors.
<li> <b>Media</b>:
     Microchip CSI2 demux controllers,
     Hynix Hi-847 sensors,
     OmniVision OV08D10 and OG01A1B sensors, and
     Intersil ISL7998x video decoders.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     Qualcomm MSM power manager controllers,
     Xilinx ZynqMP SHA3 accelerators,
     TI TPS6286x power regulators,
     Richtek RT5190A power-management ICs,
     Sunplus SP7021 SPI controllers,
     LiteX MMC host controllers, and
     Tesla full-self-driving clock controllers.
<li> <b>Sound</b>:
     Texas Instruments TAS5805M speaker amplifiers,
     AMD PCI audio coprocessors, and
     Awinic AW8738 audio amplifiers.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> New documentation of interest includes
     <a href="/Articles/888891/">some guidelines for researchers</a>
     studying the kernel community,
     an <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/84dacdbd5352">overview of the
     readahead code</a>, <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-regressions.rst">how
     to report regressions</a>, and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/handling-regressions.rst">how
     developers should handle regressions</a>.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There is a new kernel keyring called <tt>machine</tt>; it contains the
     machine-owner keys implemented by the <tt>shim</tt> bootloader
     interface.  Keys in the <tt>machine</tt> keyring can be trusted within
     the kernel and thus used to sign artifacts (such as modules or
     integrity data) used after the initial boot process.
<li> Support for asymmetric TPM-backed private keys has been removed.  This
     feature, initially added for the 3.7 release, depends on an obsolete
     TPM version and had some security 
     issues of its own; it is hoped that nobody is using it.
<li> The random-number generator has seen a lot of work.  The differences
     between <tt>/dev/random</tt> and <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> <a
     href="/Articles/884875/">have been removed</a> (though some of the
     <tt>urandom</tt> changes had to be reverted after <a
     href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220322155820.GA1745955@roeck-us.net/">a
     regression was reported</a>).  There is <a
     href="/Articles/887207/">a new mechanism</a> for the avoidance of
     random-stream duplication when a virtual machine forks.  The BLAKE2s
     algorithm is now used internally.  There is more; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5628b8de1228">the merge
     changelog</a> and <a
     href="https://www.zx2c4.com/projects/linux-rng-5.17-5.18/">this
     page</a> for lots more details.
<li> The kernel now provides saturating arithmetic helpers for
     <tt>size_t</tt> values; these can be used to harden code against
     integer-overflow bugs.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e1be43d9b5d0">this commit</a> for
     more information.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The first big chunk of work from the <a href="/Articles/880175/">fast
     kernel-headers tree</a> has found its way in with a significant
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ccacfe56d7ec">reorganization</a>
     of the scheduler header files.
<li> The block-layer congestion-tracking code, which <a
     href="/Articles/873672/">was found to be unused</a> last year, has
     been removed.
<li> The memory-management code has been enhanced with <a
     href="/Articles/884448/">remote per-CPU page list draining</a>.
<li> More of the <a href="/Articles/849538/">folio patch series</a> has
     been merged; this set converts internal memory-management functions
     (including the varieties of <tt>get_user_pages()</tt>) to folios and
     enables the creation of large folios in the readahead code.  A second
     set converts <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6b1f86f8e9c7">a set
     of <tt>address_space_operations</tt></a> to folios.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/832121/"><tt>set_fs()</tt> infrastructure</a>
     has finally been fully removed.
</ul>
<p>

A quick check shows that linux-next currently contains nearly 9,000 commits
that have not yet been pulled into the mainline, so it would seem that the
5.18 kernel will have a lot more to offer still.  The merge window can be
expected to remain open until April&nbsp;3; tune in shortly after that for
a summary of the remaining work pulled for this release.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The new feature sounds similar to user-level statically defined tracepoints (USDT), described in <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/753601/">https://lwn.net/Articles/753601/</a>  That article states that creation of USDT needs Systemtap, but instead one can use the folly library (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/tracing/README.md">https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/tracing...</a>).   As far as I can tell, the main difference between the two features is that USDT relies on bpf() to load a uprobe which then has debugfs uprobe_events.  Perhaps that interface is simply less convenient than controlling an event  via ftrace and then mmap()-ing shared memory in the case of the new user_events?<br>

What do those do? Does FSD require a different type of clock than normal computers (or normal navigation systems)?<br>

The driver consist mainly of register names definitions and some information how the clock controller is interconnected.<br>
You can look at the patchset at <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220113121143.22280-1-alim.akhtar@samsung.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220113121143.22280-1-alim....</a><br>
For more human-consumable, here&#x27;s a patch adding DT documentation: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220113121143.22280-2-alim.akhtar@samsung.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220113121143.22280-2-alim....</a><br>
Keep in mind that linux kernel contains similar drivers for multitude of clocks embedded in SoCs. Tesla FSD driver is nothing special.<br>

I think there’s a misunderstanding - this is a clock generator, as an *clock frequency*, not a *clock*, as in time keeping.  It’s an implementation detail for an SoC.<br>
<p>
I actually didn’t realize those things interacted with the OS at all.  I wish I knew why - my naive view suggests they wouldn’t need to.<br>

<p>
I&#x27;m not an expert but I think the basic reason is that the OS knows which SoC hardware blocks need to be powered on for the current application, and that determines what clock signals are required, so the OS has to have some control over the clocks. Also applications might want to configure UART baud rates, display refresh rates, etc, for which the hardware will need different clock frequencies, so the OS needs to mediate between those applications and the hardware.<br>
<p>
As SoCs get increasingly complex, you may need rather sophisticated logic to work out precisely how to configure the low-level clock hardware (all the oscillators and PLLs and dividers and muxes and whatever) to generate those signals power-efficiently and with the required levels of accuracy and synchronisation. You&#x27;ve already got a kernel driver so you might as well put all the logic in there (instead of in hardware or firmware) and the drivers end up reflecting the internal complexity of every variant of every SoC.<br>

(In case it makes my explanation clearer, I think the concepts are nicely illustrated by the image on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40214987/stm32-internal-clocks">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40214987/stm32-intern...</a> . That shows the multiple clock sources (a high-accuracy 32768Hz driven by an external crystal, a low-accuracy 16MHz from an internal RC oscillator, etc), PLLs (which multiply frequencies), dividers (which, uh, divide frequencies), and muxes to select between different inputs, eventually leading to various groups of peripherals. You need a driver to configure all of that stuff. And this example is a pretty simple microcontroller - a big SoC should use similar concepts but lots more of everything.)<br>

<p>
A simple example is a MMC/SD card: these have clock speeds desired by which card you plug in. The controller asks the card (at low frequency) what kind of clock frequencies it supports and then scales up to what the card and controller can handle.<br>
<p>
Other examples include SoCs designed to handled several different displays, which are LED panels clocked directly from the chip. It then has to adjust to whatever is connected.<br>
<p>
Intel systems often hide the clock control inside BIOS etc, but on Arm SoC systems the trust in BIOS-like constructs is low, and instead much of that low level control ends up in the operating systems.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 7, 2024</br>
           </div>
The desire for the ability to checkpoint a process — to record its state in
a form that can be restarted at a future time — on Linux is almost as old as
Linux itself.  See, for example, <a
href="/1998/0528/a/checkpoint.html">this announcement</a> of a checkpoint
project that appeared in LWN in 1998.  While working solutions exist, they
can be somewhat fragile and difficult to use; it is not surprising that
some people are interested in finding a better alternative.  A current
effort goes by the name CRIB,
for Checkpoint/Restore in (naturally) BPF.  It is far from clear that CRIB
will replace the existing solutions, but it is an interesting look at a
different way of solving the problem.
<p>
A checkpoint/restore solution must overcome two challenges, neither of
which is easy.  On the checkpoint side, it is necessary to obtain a
complete description of a process (or set of processes), with no important
details overlooked; that requires collecting a lot of information that the
kernel was not designed to export.  On the restore side, that information
must be used to recreate the checkpointed process(es), possibly on a
different system, in such a way that those processes cannot tell the
difference — once again, using interfaces that were not designed for this
purpose.
<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>
Early efforts to implement checkpoint/restore functionality focused on the
kernel.  There was a patch set that first <a
href="/Articles/293575/">started getting serious attention</a> in 2008 that
added two new system calls (<tt>checkpoint()</tt> and <tt>restart()</tt>)
to do all of the work.  The former would write the entire state of a
process to a given file, while the latter would restore the process from a
file.  This work added quite a bit of complexity to the kernel and never
really got to the point where it could reliably checkpoint and restore
processes.  Kernel developers were concerned about the challenges of
maintaining a feature that was widely intrusive even in its incomplete
state, and about whether it would ever reach the needed level of
completeness and reliability.  More than two years later, this work was <a
href="/Articles/414264/">still being discussed</a>, but there was a clear
appetite for alternatives.
<p>
<h4>Moving to user space</h4>
<p>
In 2011, Pavel Emelyanov showed up with the first <a
href="/Articles/452184/">checkpoint/restore in user space (CRIU)
patches</a> that moved that work out of the kernel.  This approach, which
had its origins in the <a href="https://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page">OpenVZ
project</a>, attracted a lot of interest, but it was still a long path
toward a working solution.  Kernel interfaces were not developed with the
idea of providing enough information to completely describe a process, or
to recreate a process that matches the original in every detail at a later
time.  It is worth thinking about all of the information that is needed,
including:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> All of the threads running within the process, where they are
     executing, their priority, and their signal-handling state.
<li> A complete memory map of the process: which mappings exist at which
     addresses and the protections that apply to each.
<li> A list of the process's open files, including the actual files that
     have been opened, whether each was opened for read, write, or append
     access, the current file position, and the file-descriptor number.
<li> Every open network connection, who the peer is, which protocol is in
     use, and any in-transit data.
<li> The configuration of the namespaces in which the process is running.
<li> Active file notifications, terminal configurations, active timers, and
     no end of other details.
</ul>
<p>
On the other side, any solution must be able to restore all of this
data, creating a running process with no surprising changes in its
configuration or environment.
<p>
Much of this information was already available, perhaps inefficiently, from
the kernel via the system-call interface and <tt>/proc</tt>.  But, in many
cases, additional support was needed to get to a working solution; the
developers behind the effort that eventually turned into <a
href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">CRIU</a> spent years on that project.
They added features like <a href="/Articles/454427/">TCP connection
hijacking</a> and <a href="/Articles/495304/">connection repair</a>, more
information in <tt>/proc</tt>, the <a
href="/Articles/478111/"><tt>kcmp()</tt> system call</a>, <a
href="/Articles/766089/">time namespaces</a> (so that a sudden time jump
does not cause a restarted process to misbehave), and many others over
time.  In 2024, CRIU is, as a result of this long effort, a working
solution with an active user and developer base.
<p>
CRIU is not without its shortcomings, though, many of which derive from the
fact that CRIU must rely on a wide range of kernel interfaces that, for the
most part, were not designed to support the checkpoint and restore
operations.  Checkpointing a process requires opening a large set of files
in <tt>/proc</tt> and <tt>/sys</tt>, which slows things down considerably,
and each of those files has its own special format that must be parsed.
CRIU is easily broken as the kernel evolves.  Newer features, such as
io_uring, are difficult to support — if they can be supported at all.
Similar challenges exist on the restore side of the problem.
<p>
<h4>Moving back into the kernel with BPF</h4>
<p>
Juntong Deng thinks that the solution to these problems lies in BPF; the <a
href="/ml/all/AM6PR03MB58488045E4D0FA6AEDC8BDE099A52@AM6PR03MB5848.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com">current
CRIB patches</a> have been posted as a proof of the concept.  The core idea
is that a user-space checkpoint application would load a BPF program to
obtain the necessary information directly from the kernel.  It would
marshal and format that data, then feed it to user space by way of a fast
ring-buffer interface.  The user-space piece would end up with an interface
that provides functionality similar to the <tt>checkpoint()</tt> system
call that was proposed years ago, without the complexity that CRIU must manage.
<p>
Of course, that complexity does not go away entirely; it is instead pushed
into the BPF part of the system.  A suitably privileged BPF program has
read access to much of the kernel, so it could obtain a great deal of the
needed information without any special support.  It can simply read the
kernel data structures directly.  For the more complex cases where digging
through kernel structures is not practical, special-purpose kfuncs can be
provided for the BPF program to use.  For example, <a
href="/ml/all/AM6PR03MB5848DCE9DC6D96454E9C3EBD99A52@AM6PR03MB5848.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com">this
patch</a> adds a kfunc called <tt>bpf_file_from_task_fd()</tt>, which will
return the <tt>struct file</tt> pointer corresponding to a process's file
descriptor.  The function will also take a reference to that file so that
it will not vanish while the BPF program is reading it.  Many of the other
added kfuncs are focused on obtaining data from network sockets, which tend
to have a complex internal state.
<p>
Any BPF program used to checkpoint a process in this way is going to be
strongly tied to a specific version of the kernel.  In theory, BPF
interfaces are not a part of the kernel's stable ABI, so the prospect of
breaking checkpoint programs should not hinder ongoing kernel development.
Kernel changes can break CRIU as well, of course, but CRIU depends on
user-space interfaces that are not supposed to break; that suggests that a
BPF-based checkpoint function might require more maintenance to keep up
with the kernel.  In exchange, though, it would have deeper and better
access to the state of the processes it is checkpointing and should be
quite a bit faster.
<p>
The restore side of the problem might prove to be a bit more difficult.
While a BPF program can be given the ability to freely read data from the
kernel's address space, the same is not true for writing data.  There is a
set of macros that goes by the name of <tt>BPF_CORE_READ()</tt> that BPF
programs use to read data.  Deng, in the patch cover letter, suggested the
addition of an equivalent <tt>BPF_CORE_WRITE()</tt> set, saying:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I am not sure what the current attitude of the kernel community
	towards BPF_CORE_WRITE is, personally I think it is well worth
	adding, as we need a portable way to change the value in the
	kernel.
</blockquote>
<p>
Followers of BPF development will not have been surprised when Alexei
Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/all/etzm4h5qm2jhgi6d4pevooy2sebrvgb3lsa67ym4x7zbh5bgnj@feoli4hj22so">made
the kernel community's position clear</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I'm afraid BPF_CORE_WRITE cannot be introduced without breaking all
	safety nets.  It will make bpf just as unsafe as any kernel module
	if bpf progs can start writing into arbitrary kernel data
	structures. So it's a show stopper.
</blockquote>
<p>
Deng <a
href="/ml/all/AM6PR03MB5848CA34B5B68C90F210285E99B12@AM6PR03MB5848.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com">responded</a>
that, without the ability to write arbitrary kernel data, the restore
functionality cannot be easily implemented, so development on CRIB would
focus on the checkpoint side for now.  Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi <a
href="/ml/all/CAP01T75na=fz7EhrP4Aw0WZ33R7jTbZ4BcmY56S1xTWczxHXWw@mail.gmail.com">disliked</a>
that idea, saying that it would be better to have the form of a restore
solution in mind, even if it cannot be implemented immediately.
<p>
Various other details of the series were discussed; they seem much more
amenable to an agreed-upon solution.  The ability to restore arbitrary
kernel data structures would appear to be a real sticking point, though; it
is not clear which direction an acceptable solution will take.  The restore
process could be carried out mostly in user space, as is done with CRIU
now, or another set of kfuncs could be added to facilitate the restoration
of a process's state.  While this work has been <a
href="https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1812/">scheduled for
discussion</a> at the upcoming Linux Plumbers Conference, the amount of
progress that can be made in a 15-minute slot will be limited.  The best
guide to where this project is headed will be found in future postings of
the patch series.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There's something I don't understand. If the BPF "scripts" needed for C/R may break from one kernel version to the next, and would be maintained separately from the kernel tree, why don't the C/R folks use an out-of-tree kernel module instead? It seems to me the maintenance burden would be similar, there'd be a bigger API at their disposal, and it wouldn't require controversial changes to the BPF interpreter. <br>

Imagine you have a tmux session, and inside you have irssi (an IRC client) connected to few networks. Pretty typical setup for ircing.<br>

Suddenly you have to upgrade the kernel. Before reboot you checkpoint the tmux session, reboot, then restore. From the perspective of IRC network you never left or reconnected.<br>

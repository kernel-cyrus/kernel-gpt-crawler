NUMA systems have, by design, memory which is local to specific nodes
(groups of processors).  While all memory is accessible, local memory is
faster to work with than remote memory.  The kernel takes NUMA behavior
into account by attempting to allocate local memory for processes, and by
avoiding moving processes between nodes whenever possible.  Sometimes
processes must be moved, however, with the result that the local-allocation
optimization can quickly become a pessimization instead.  What would be
nice, in such situations, would be the ability to move a process's memory
when the process itself is shifted to a new node.
<p>

Memory migration patches have been circulating for some time now.  The
latest version is <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/156603/">this patch
set</a> posted by Christoph Lameter.  This patch deliberately does not
solve the entire problem, but it does try to establish enough
infrastructure that a full migration solution can be evolved eventually.
<p>

This patch does not automatically migrate memory for processes which have
been moved; instead, it leaves the migration decision to user space.  There
is a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    long migrate_pages(pid_t pid, unsigned long maxnode,
                       unsigned long *old_nodes,
                       unsigned long *new_nodes);
</pre>
<p>
This call will attempt to move any pages belonging to the given process
from <tt>old_nodes</tt> to <tt>new_nodes</tt>.  There is also a new
<tt>MPOL_MF_MOVE</tt> option to the <a
href="http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html"><tt>set_mempolicy()</tt></a>
system call which can be used to the same effect.  Either way, user space
can request that a given process vacate a set of nodes.  This operation can
be performed in response to an explicit move of the process itself (which
might be done by a system scheduling daemon, for example), or in response
to other events, such as the impending shutdown and removal of a node.
<p>

The implementation is simple for now: the code iterates over the process's
memory and attempts to force each page needing migration to be swapped.
When the process faults the page back in, it should then be allocated on
the process's current node.  The force-out process actually takes a few
passes over the list; initially it passes over locked pages and just
concerns itself with pages which are easy to evict.  In later passes, it
will wait for locked pages and do the hard work of getting the final pages
out of memory.
<p>

Migrating pages by way of the swap device is not the most efficient way of
moving them across a NUMA system.  Later work on the patch will be aimed at
adding direct node-to-node migration, and other features as well.  In the
mean time, however, the developers would like to see the current
implementation merged in time for 2.6.15.  Andrew Morton has <a
href="/Articles/157070/">expressed some reservations</a>, however: he would
like to see an explanation of how this code can be made to work with near
complete reliability.  There are a number of things which can prevent the
migration of pages; these include pages locked in place by user space, page
undergoing direct I/O, and more.  Christoph <a
href="/Articles/157074/">responded</a> that the patch will get there,
eventually.  Whether this claim is sufficiently convincing to get the
migration patches into 2.6.15 remains to be seen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

 <br>
... Especially for those of us that have swap disabled!  It'll be nice to <br>
have migration working, but what's this with forcing it out to slow swap <br>
so it can be faulted back in on the other node?  It's likely that's so <br>
slow the cost of doing it exceeds the potential benefit of NUMA optimized <br>
memory accesses for the remaining lifetime of the process, in many cases! <br>
 <br>
Of course, if by "swapped out" and "faulted back in", it just means a trip <br>
out of directly allocated memory into cache memory and faulted back in <br>
from there, no big deal (unless no swap mean's it's disabled), but if it's <br>
actually written to disk, that's /quite/ a bit of extra latency to make up <br>
in NUMA optimization, enough so it's not likely to be worth it save for <br>
processes running (and accessing that memory) for &gt; an hour, anyway. <br>
 <br>
So... I guess my view on this depends on the defined value of <br>
"eventually", altho I think I'd still prefer it wait out a version, to be <br>
merged with .16 (or later), if it's all going to be swap dependant <br>
for .15.  After all, it's not like the patches won't still be there for <br>
those that want them with .15, anyway, just not mainlined (-mm might be <br>
fine). <br>

      I don't understand how userspace is expected to know when and why it   <br>
would be worthwhile to move pages from node to node.  We don't have   <br>
explicit system calls requesting that pages be written out to the swap   <br>
device or faulted back -- the OS handles it automatically and it's the   <br>
job of the VM system to do it well.  Recent optimisations like swap   <br>
readahead are progress in that direction.   <br>
  <br>
I imagine the intermediate use of the swap device is merely a stepping  <br>
stone for the implementor.  I'm sure Christoph is aware of the price of  <br>
disk latency!  <br>
  <br>
Perhaps nonlocal memory should be treated as a fast swap device after a   <br>
process has been migrated -- pages can be faulted across to local memory   <br>
when they are used on the new node.  As an optimisation this could be   <br>
'extra lazy', since all pages are actually accessible -- eg. only pages   <br>
written to by the new node (and, if there is a good heuristic for this,   <br>
the most frequently read pages) need be copied to local memory.   <br>
  <br>
Do NUMA systems have memory-to-memory copy operations which don't trash <br>
the processor caches?  I can imagine a "DMA" between node memories could  <br>
take place while the source pages remain readable by the processor.  <br>

      Is there some overlap between this and suspend-to-disk functionality?<br>
<p>
And if there isn't, should there be?<br>

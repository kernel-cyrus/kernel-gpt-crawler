<h1>Power management: looking for a direction</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted August 18, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Power management remains one of the unfinished jobs from the 2.5
development series.  Many of the pieces are in place, including the whole
device model infrastructure, but the kernel still lacks a comprehensive,
working power management subsystem.  There are signs that things are
starting to happen, but it seems that the developers still lack a clear
idea of how they want to go forward.
<p>

Back on August 9, Patrick Mochel posted <a href="/Articles/97142/">a
patch</a> aimed at improving the power management subsystem.  It brought
significant changes to the device model, including:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Two power management methods were added to the class subsystem.  
     Until this point, classes had not been part of the power management
     code at all; they are, instead, a way of exporting device information
     in a functional organization.  The rationale behind putting power
     management functions in classes was that the higher-level code would
     better understand how to "quiesce" a device in preparation for a
     power state change.
<p>
<li> Three new power management methods were be added to the device model
     representation of a bus (<tt>struct bus_type</tt>).  These were
     <tt>pm_save()</tt> (save state prior to a state transition),
     <tt>pm_restore()</tt> (restore state afterward), and
     <tt>pm_power()</tt> (perform an actual state change).  These methods
     would replace the current <tt>suspend()</tt> and <tt>resume()</tt> bus
     methods, and the equivalent methods associated with <tt>struct
     device_driver</tt>.  The idea is to move all power management tasks
     firmly into the bus-level code, and to let that code pass things on to
     low-level drivers as appropriate.
<p>
<li> Each device would get two new arrays.  One of these
     (<tt>pm_supports</tt>) lists all of the power management states
     supported by the device, in that particular device's (usually
     bus-specific) terms.  The second array (<tt>pm_system</tt>) is a
     simple mapping from the power states understood system-wide into the
     equivalent device states.  These states are described by the new
     <tt>pm_state</tt> structure, and sysfs interfaces exist to query the
     supported states and to transition between them.
</ul>
<p>

The resulting discussion implied a lot of changes to this patch; among
other things, the idea of using the class layer to quiesce devices was
controversial.  An updated version of the patch has not been posted,
however.
<p>

Pavel Machek, meanwhile, has been trying to address a much smaller piece of
the problem: confusion over what the power management states really mean.
The power management code itself uses a set of states roughly related to
those defined in the ACPI specification, but other parts of the system (PCI
drivers, for example) have a different set of states.  The current power
management methods take a <tt>u32</tt> state value, and it is far from
clear what kind of state is intended.
<p>

Pavel's <a href="/Articles/98430/">patch</a> tries to address this problem
by creating a new <tt>enum</tt> type called <tt>system_state</tt>.  The
bus- and driver-level power management methods are modified to accept a
parameter of this type, so that it is clear that (1)&nbsp;the power
management core's state values are being used, and (2)&nbsp;the parameter
describes the state to which the entire system is changing.  It clears up a
core ambiguity without otherwise changing how things work.

<p>
Even this change is controversial, however.  The largest concern is that,
eventually, it is expected that the drivers will need more information than
just the target system state.  So, it is suggested, the type of the
parameter should be a structure pointer rather than a simple scalar value.
But nobody has really figured out what should go into the structure yet.
<p>

Getting it right the first time matters in this case.  It is generally
accepted that fixing power management will require a driver API change, and
that, potentially, all drivers in the kernel (and out of tree as well) will
have to be changed at once.  Developers are resigned to this change - but
they would really rather only do it once.  So, <a
href="/Articles/98436/">says Patrick</a>, it's better to wait:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Why be hasty? We need to do it right and do it once. If that means
	a couple of more weeks and several more emails, than so be it.
	Otherwise, we'll be stuck with a sub-par solution for who knows how
	long.
</div>
<p>
What this means is that the discussion is likely to continue for a while -
and that an upgraded power management system will not be ready until
2.6.10, at best.  Linux users, who have waited a long time for better power
management, can probably manage to be patient for a little while yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

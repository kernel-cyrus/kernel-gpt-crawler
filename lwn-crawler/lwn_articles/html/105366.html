<h1>When should a process be migrated?</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted October 6, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
The performance of modern computers is heavily influenced by how well they
use the processor's memory cache.  Going to main memory is a slow operation
(from a processor's point of view); an operating system which forces main
memory accesses too often will run slowly.  One of the things the Linux
kernel does to optimize cache use is to try to avoid moving processes
between CPUs if it is likely that those processes have a fair amount of
useful data in the cache.  When a process moves, it leaves its cached data
behind and must begin populating the new CPU's cache from the beginning.
That repopulation requires memory accesses and slows things down.
<p>

The metric used by the kernel to decide whether moving a particular task is
advisable is a scheduling domain parameter called <tt>cache_hot_time</tt>.
If the process has run in the current processor within the "hot time," it
is considered to have significant data in the cache and is not moved
unnecessarily.  In recent kernels, <tt>cache_hot_time</tt> for processors
on non-NUMA, SMP systems is 2.5ms.
<p>

Kenneth Chen recently <a href="/Articles/105368/">did some tests</a> to see
if that value makes sense.  On his four-processor system, he found that
workload throughput with a 2.5ms hot time was 12% below its peak level -
which happens with a 10ms value.  As it turns out, 10ms was once the
default value for the cache hot time; Kenneth proposes that this value be
restored.  Others have, instead, suggested that a new tunable parameter be
provided so that administrators could find and set the optimal value for
their systems.

<p>
Ingo Molnar has come up with <a href="/Articles/105352/">a different
approach</a> - have the computer figure out for itself what the optimal
"cache hot" time is.  To this end, his code performs the following steps
for each pair of processors on the system:
<p>
<ol> 

<li> The first processor fills a large, shared buffer with data, thus 
     populating its own cache with (some of) the contents of that buffer.
<p>
<li> The second processor fills a private buffer, filling its own cache.
<p>
<li> The second processor then overwrites the shared buffer, moving the
     contents of that buffer into its own cache.
</ol>
<p>

The time required for the third step is, to an approximation, a worst case
scenario for what it costs to move a process when it has filled the local
cache with data.  Ingo tested the code on a few systems and got optimal
values which vary from 5ms (on a four-processor Pentium&nbsp;4 system) to
87ms (for an eight-processor, semi-NUMA, Pentium&nbsp;3 system).  Clearly,
one default value for all systems is not the right answer.  This also looks
like a good number for the computer to find for itself - assuming
subsequent tests show that this patch (or a successor) is finding something
close to the optimal value.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Slick indeed.  <br>
  <br>
In any case, it would appear 2.5ms is to short.  While auto-config timing  <br>
continues development, it would appear upping that 2.5ms time to 5-10ms  <br>
would be in order, 5ms would in all cases be better than 2.5, while 10ms  <br>
would appear to be better in most cases, and a good compromise between the <br>
5ms cases and the 87ms cases.  <br>
  <br>
Also, the article points out that the current 2.5ms time is applied in  <br>
non-NUMA cases.  A couple sentences or a paragraph mentioning how NUMA  <br>
treatment differs would have been in order.  It should obviously be a  <br>
higher time, 87ms as mentioned in the one case, as NUMA means potentially  <br>
moving data in main memory as well as cache, but is that also a set value  <br>
and what is it (a single sentence mentioning the NUMA value), or is that  <br>
already calculated dynamically (up to a paragraph if the dynamic  <br>
calculation can be explained easily at a high level, a couple sentences  <br>
giving an expected range for comparison purposes and stating further  <br>
detail is beyond the scope of the article, otherwise)?  <br>
  <br>
This is of particular interest here, as I'm running a dual Opteron in NUMA  <br>
mode, 512 MB hung off of each CPU.  <br>

      Just some side questions:  When does this test occur?  During boot?  Will the test be rerun after a CPU has been hot swapped?<br>
<p>
This is an interesting way of optimising a system.<br>

      What about latencies? The mentioned tests are only for through-put. In some cases where you rather want a responsive system you might want to migrate threads faster than on a system where you want the maximum through-put.<br>

      This is measuring a red herring.  Apparently, the method uses the "cost to move a process" number -- 5ms and 87ms in the example -- as the cache_hot_time.  The two numbers have nothing to do with each other.  cache_hot_time is about determining how likely it is that a process has stuff in cache.  If it does, there's reason to try to keep it on the same CPU; if not, moving it is free.
<p>
What it costs to move a process is another parameter that one could use <em>in conjunction with</em> cache_hot_time to weight the decision whether or not to move a process.  
<p>
A self-tuning cache_hot_time, on the other hand, would look like this:  Keep a process running that regularly accesses some typical amount of memory and sleeps for varying times.  Keep it on the same CPU.  Have it determine each time it wakes up, by timing, if its memory was still cached.  If it was, then cache_hot_time should be greater than the most recent sleep time; if not, it should be less.

      What would work even better would be counters in the MMU that counted RAM accesses. It would provide the scheduler with good estimates on how much data a particular process had in each CPU's cache.<br>

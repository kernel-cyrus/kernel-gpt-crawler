<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Michael Kerrisk</b><br>March 13, 2013</br>
           </div>
<p> One of the features merged in the 3.9 development cycle was TCP and UDP
support for the <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt> socket option; that support was
implemented in a series of patches by Tom Herbert.  The new socket option
allows multiple sockets on the same host to
bind to the same port, and is intended to improve the performance of
multithreaded network server applications running on top of multicore systems.

<p>

<p> The basic concept of <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt> is simple enough. Multiple
servers (processes or threads) can bind to the same port if they each set
the option as follows:

<pre>
    int sfd = socket(domain, socktype, 0);

    int optval = 1;
    setsockopt(sfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEPORT, &amp;optval, sizeof(optval));

    bind(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;addr, addrlen);
</pre>

<p> So long as the <i>first</i> server sets this option before binding its
socket, then any number of other servers can also bind to the same port if
they also set the option beforehand. The requirement that the first server
must specify this option prevents port hijacking&mdash;the possibility that
a rogue application binds to a port already used by an existing server in
order to capture (some of) its incoming connections or datagrams. To
prevent unwanted processes from hijacking a port that has already been
bound by a server using <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt>, all of the servers that
later bind to that port must have an effective user ID that matches the
effective user ID used to perform the first bind on the socket.

<p> <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt> can be used with both TCP and UDP sockets.  With
TCP sockets, it allows multiple listening sockets&mdash;normally each in a
different thread&mdash;to be bound to the same port. Each thread can then
accept incoming connections on the port by calling <tt>accept()</tt>.  This
presents an alternative to the traditional approaches used by multithreaded
servers that accept incoming connections on a single socket.

<p>
The first of the
traditional approaches is to have a single listener thread that accepts all
incoming connections and then passes these off to other threads for
processing. The problem with this approach is that the listening thread can
become a bottleneck in extreme cases. In <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/102140/focus=102150">early
discussions</a> on <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt>, Tom noted that he was dealing
with applications that accepted 40,000 connections per second. Given that
sort of number, it's unsurprising to learn that Tom works at Google.

<p> The second of the traditional approaches used by multithreaded servers
operating on a single port is to have all of the threads (or processes)
perform an <tt>accept()</tt> call on a single listening socket in a simple
event loop of the form:

<pre>
    while (1) {
        new_fd = accept(...);
        process_connection(new_fd);
    }
</pre>

<p> The problem with this technique, as Tom <a
href="/Articles/542718/">pointed out</a>, is that when multiple threads are
waiting in the <tt>accept()</tt> call, wake-ups are not fair, so that,
under high load, incoming connections may be distributed across threads in a
very unbalanced fashion. At Google, they have seen a factor-of-three
difference between the thread accepting the most connections and the thread
accepting the fewest connections; that sort of imbalance can lead to
underutilization of CPU cores. By contrast, the <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt>
implementation distributes connections evenly across all of the threads (or
processes) that are blocked in <tt>accept()</tt> on the same port.

<p> As with TCP, <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt> allows multiple UDP sockets to be
bound to the same port. This facility could, for example, be useful in a
DNS server operating over UDP. With <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt>, each thread
could use <tt>recv()</tt> on its own socket to accept datagrams arriving on
the port. The traditional approach is that all threads would compete to
perform <tt>recv()</tt> calls on a single shared socket. As with the second
of the traditional TCP scenarios described above, this can lead to
unbalanced loads across the threads. By contrast, <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt>
distributes datagrams evenly across all of the receiving threads.  

<p> Tom <a href="/Articles/542728/">noted</a> that the traditional
<tt>SO_REUSEADDR</tt> socket option already allows multiple UDP sockets to
be bound to, and accept datagrams on, the same UDP port. However, by
contrast with <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt>, <tt>SO_REUSEADDR</tt> does not prevent
port hijacking and does not distribute datagrams evenly across the
receiving threads.

<p> There are two other noteworthy points about Tom's patches.  The first
of these is a useful aspect of the implementation. Incoming connections and
datagrams are distributed to the server sockets using a hash based on the
4-tuple of the connection&mdash;that is, the peer IP address and port plus
the local IP address and port. This means, for example, that if a client
uses the same socket to send a series of datagrams to the server port, then
those datagrams will all be directed to the same receiving server (as long
as it continues to exist).  This eases the task of conducting stateful
conversations between the client and server.

<p> The other noteworthy point is that there is a <a
href="/Articles/542738/">defect</a> in the current implementation of TCP
<tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt>. If the number of listening sockets bound to a port
changes because new servers are started or existing servers terminate, it
is possible that incoming connections can be dropped during the three-way
handshake. The problem is that connection requests are tied to a specific
listening socket when the initial SYN packet is received during the
handshake. If the number of servers bound to the port changes, then the
<tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt> logic might not route the final ACK of
the handshake to the correct listening socket. In this case, the client
connection will be reset, and the server is left with an orphaned
request structure. A solution to the problem is still being worked on, and
may consist of implementing a connection request table that can be shared
among multiple listening sockets.

<p> The <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt> option is non-standard, but available in a
similar form on a number of other UNIX systems (notably, the BSDs, where the
idea originated). It seems to offer a useful alternative for squeezing the
maximum performance out of network applications running on multicore
systems, and thus is likely to be a welcome addition for some application
developers.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One argument for SO_REUSEPORT is that it makes it easier to use independently started processes on the same socket. E.g. with it you can simply start the new server - potentially in a new version - and shutdown the old one after that, without any service interruption. At the moment you need to have a unix socket between the servers, send over the tcp socket file handle, start accept()ing in the new server and then shutdown the old one.<br>

The current implementation doesn't actually support that. That's because each socket has its own queue, and when the 3-way handshake completes a connection is assigned to exactly one of those queues. That creates a race condition between accept(2) and close(2).<br>
<p>
So, no, this doesn't support seamless server restarts.<br>
<p>
Ironically it's the BSD semantics which support seamless server restarts. In my tests OS X's behavior (which I presume is identical to FreeBSD and other BSDs) is that the last socket to bind is the only one to receive new connections. That allows the old server to drain its queue and retire without worrying about any dropped connections.<br>

<p>
That probably explains it.  If you used this technique on multiple threads accepting on the same traditional socket, you would be fixing one thing and breaking another.  Today, if a thread is blocked in accept() and no other thread is, and a connection request arrives, the thread gets it.  It sounds like with a SO_REUSEPORT socket, the connection request would wait until its predetermined accepter is ready to take it.

I'll point out that this is very similar to the CLUSTERIP capability that iptables provides.<br>
<p>
CLUSTERIP shares one IP across multiple machines, doing a hash to make decide which machine gets the packet to userspace (they have the option of using the full 4-tuple or only part of it) You then use heartbeat or other clustering software to make sure that there is always some box that will handle the connection (with the expected gaps due to races when machines go down and the clustering software hasn't responded yet)<br>
<p>
SO_REUSEPORT sounds like it extends this capability to multiple processes/threads inside one box, but with the re-balancing being done automatically by the kernel (with with very similar races when processes/threads go down and the kernel hasn't responded yet)<br>
<p>
This is a very nice new feature to have available.<br>

The ability to route to same tuple sounds like premature optimization. For example, if i have spawned few stateless servers, and if a connection request arrives, it would simply sit in queue till the original server is ready? Most typical architecture for stateful servers is to spawn 3 of them on different physical machines for reliability purposes and have load balancer perform sticky sessions. Another option is to spawn stateless servers with distributed cache to maintain cache. The ability to route connections and even datagrams to the same tuple is really an "application" level concern. What is the original server tuple is not running any more? Do i need to plug in policies for SO_REUSEPORT to determine how to handle failure conditions?<br>

I think, one should remember that, this is done for the sake of performance, for those who need it.<br>
<p>
It isn't meant to replace load balancers or something similar.<br>
<p>
Maybe within a single application, with multiple threads to handle the load, seems like a good option to have.<br>

Well, again, it was in BSD first. Credit where it's due.<br>

But generally, Unix "standards" have always trailed implementations. It's just that now Linux and BSD are in reality the primary Unix implementations.<br>

DragonFly BSD has implemented SO_REUSEPORT since July 2013 too; <a href="http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2013-July/053632.html">http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2013-July/0...</a> has some very interesting performance numbers.<br>
<p>
SO_REUSEPORT naturally aligns with networks stacks parallelized like DFly's/Solaris's (hash connection state early, map &amp; fanout to a fixed CPU per connection, no locking till you hit socket buffer layer).<br>

Related to "The second of the traditional approaches [...] wake-ups are not fair"<br>
<p>
I am just wondering does that really matter? I mean all it matters is that whoever as CPU cycles should pick up the next workload. Now I am not sure why the thread itself picking up the load is actually relevant. The CPU being underutilized seems to solve by itself. I mean if a core is saturated then effectively an extra thread will pick up the next connection and this should work well with what the CPU scheduler is already doing for balancing.<br>

The author seems to be talking in the context of multi-core machines. Imagine a thread pinned to each core. It sounds like author is saying that load is improperly balanced, hence one core would be at 100% and others maybe at 30%, leading to under utilization of cores.<br>

It looks very interesting just when thousands of connections are getting stuck in the queue before to be accepted. For our case which is a HTTP server with multiple threads and each one with its own epoll(7) queue, its critical to decide just after the accept(2) which thread will work that new connection to keep a balanced load. <br>

Is this socket option valid and usable for SCTP also? Using this option can multiple SCTP sockets on the same host bind to the same port and work precisely like what is said in this article for TCP/UDP.<br>

the SO_REUSEPORT implementation distributes connections evenly across all of the threads (or processes) that are <b>blocked in accept()</b> on the same port.
</blockquote>

I read this to mean that single threaded processes that have established connections will not receive new connections because they are not waiting in accept().  After testing and reading <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.8/net/core/sock_reuseport.c#L207">some code</a> it's clear that processes that aren't in accept() continue to receive new connections.

Hello all,<br>
  I&#x27;m terribly sorry, but things are still not so clear for me.<br>
What&#x27;s about _multicast_?<br>
<p>
It is rather common for multicast listeners to use the SO_REUSEADDR option.<br>
Should this be replaced by SO_REUSEPORT? (or not?)<br>
Should one use both? (if yes, in which order?)<br>
What is the impact?<br>
What are recommendations?<br>
<p>
Many thanks for your guidance.<br>
Best regards.<br>

To prevent unwanted processes from hijacking a port that has already been bound by a server using SO_REUSEPORT, all of the servers that later bind to that port must have an effective user ID that matches the effective user ID used to perform the first bind on the socket.<br>

Is this fully implemented in linux? we faced a online issue, another users still can listen the port<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 21, 2007</br>
           </div>
Kernel developers are generally encouraged to split patches into small
pieces before posting them to the mailing lists.  Making each change
self-contained and easy to understand helps reviewers do their job and is
thus a good thing.  That said, anybody who doubted that one can get too
much of a good 
thing surely learned the truth when Joe Perches submitted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/245340/">this patch set</a> made up of almost 550
patches, all to the same file.  It is fair to say that this deluge of
patches was not universally welcomed.
<p>

Packaging aside, the ultimate goal of Joe's patch was not particularly
controversial: he would like to make it possible to easily find out who is
the maintainer of a specific file in the kernel tree.  So, for each entry
in the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file, he added one or more lines with patterns
describing which files belong to that entry.  With that information in
place, his <tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt> script can quickly identify who is
responsible for any file in the tree.  No more digging through
<tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> or trying to extract email addresses from copyright
notices in the source.
<p>

It's an appealing idea, but nobody seems to be entirely clear on how to
implement it.  Keeping this information in a central file has a number of
obvious disadvantages.  It would clearly go out of date quickly, for
example.  The <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file tends to get stale as it is; the
chances of it being patched for every new or renamed file seem quite small.
If developers, contrary to expectations, do keep this file up to date, one
can expect large numbers of conflicts as all the resulting patches try to
touch the same file.
<p>

The patch conflict problem could be mitigated by splitting up the
<tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file into per-directory versions, much like what was
done with the kernel configuration file in the past.  There are now over
400 <tt>Kconfig</tt> files in the mainline tree; some developers have
expressed dismay at the idea of similar numbers of <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt>
files being scattered around the tree.  And, in any case, per-directory
files aren't much more 
likely to be updated than the single, central file.
<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>

So around came another idea: why not just put the maintainer information
into the source files?  The result would be nicely split documentation
which gets put in front of the relevant developers every time they edit the
file.  The record for maintenance of documentation in the code is far from
perfect, but it is much better than the record for completely out-of-line
documentation.  
<p>

One question which comes up when this approach is considered is whether the
resulting information should go into the binary kernel image or not.  It
would be easy to define a new tag like:
<p>
<pre>
    MODULE_MAINTAINER("Your name here");
</pre>
<p>
The provided information could then go into a special section in the kernel
image where special tools could find it.  Doing things this way would make
it possible for people who don't have a kernel tree handy to look up a
maintainer.  On the other hand, it would bloat the kernel image and fix
information in a binary, widely-distributed form where it could persist
long after it goes out of date.  So ex-maintainers could continue receiving
mail for years after they have changed all of the relevant documentation.
<p>
An alternative would be to just put the maintainer information at the top
of the file as a comment.  Then it would only be in the source, and would,
presumably, be relatively easy to keep up to date.  At least, until, say, a
mailing list for a major subsystem moves and all of the associated source
files have to be changed.  For example, Adrian Bunk <a
href="/Articles/246262/">noted</a> that the move of the netdev
mailing list to vger would have forced patches to about 1300 files.
<p>

Yet another approach is to find a way to store the information in the git
repository.  Git already maintains quite a bit of metadata about source
files; to some it seems natural to add maintainer information as well.  So
far, the git developers have not shown a lot of appetite for adding this
sort of feature.  But Linus did <a href="/Articles/246204/">point out</a>
that one could already use git to a similar effect with a simple command:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
    Do a script like this:
<p><pre>
	#!/bin/sh
	git log --since=6.months.ago -- "$@" |
		grep -i '^    [-a-z]*by:.*@' |
		sort | uniq -c |
		sort -r -n | head
</pre>
<p>
    and it gives you a rather good picture of who is involved with a 
    particular subdirectory or file.
</div>
<p>

The advantage of doing things this way is that the resulting output gives a
current 
picture of who has actually been working on a file - a picture which
requires no explicit maintenance at all.  That list of people is probably a
much better group to send copies of patches to than whoever might be listed
in a maintainers file; they are the ones who know about what is happening
in that part of the tree now.
<p>

No real resolution has been reached on this topic.  It may be that Linus's
approach may be the one taken by default; it already works without the need
to merge any patches at all.  The question may well stay around for a
while, though.  Approximately 2,000 developers put patches into the
mainline over the course of one year; keeping track of which of those
developers is the best to notify of changes to a particular file is never
going to be easy.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Couldn't somebody just auto-generate the MAINTAINERS file from git as part of the build process?<br>
<p>
That way we'll still have a MAINTAINERS file, but without the need for manually keeping it up to date.<br>

      Does git have no 'praise' command like subversion? I would hope that this would be more necessary than its 'blame' counterpart.<br>

      So, I used Linus's script to discover who maintains the MAINTAINERS file.<br>
<p>
~/src/linux-2.6&gt; whomaintains.sh MAINTAINERS <br>
     43     Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds &lt;torvalds@linux-foundation.org&gt;<br>

      8     Signed-off-by: Adrian Bunk &lt;bunk@stusta.de&gt;<br>
      6     Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman &lt;gregkh@suse.de&gt;<br>
      6     Signed-off-by: David S. Miller &lt;davem@davemloft.net&gt;<br>
      6     Signed-off-by: Bryan Wu &lt;bryan.wu@analog.com&gt;<br>
      5     Signed-off-by: Pierre Ossman &lt;drzeus@drzeus.cx&gt;<br>
      5     Signed-off-by: John W. Linville &lt;linville@tuxdriver.com&gt;<br>
<p>
But the script just scans through the 'Signed-off-by' (or other *by) lines in commits where that file is changed and counts them.  And since Linus and Andrew wind up with their sign-offs on just about everything, the top few entries might not be as informative as one would hope.<br>
<p>
Someone with a little more shell-fu than I have could figure out what happens when this script gets run on every file in the tree and see just how much variation there is between the results.<br>
<p>
I think some clever shell work and use of git could still give us what we're looking for, but I agree with the other comment that suggested 'git blame' is more likely to be what we want to use.<br>

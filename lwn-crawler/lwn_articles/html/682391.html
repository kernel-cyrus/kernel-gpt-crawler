<p>A few years ago, Linux scheduler maintainer Ingo Molnar
<a href="/Articles/552885/">expressed</a> a strong desire
that future improvements in CPU power management should integrate well with
the scheduler and not try to 
work independently.  Since then, there have been improvements to the
way the scheduler estimates load — <a href="/Articles/531853/">per-entity load tracking</a> in
particular — and some <a href="/Articles/655479/">patch sets</a> circulating that aim to link these
improved estimates into the CPU frequency scaling, but the recently
released 4.5 kernel still does CPU power management as it has
done it for years.  This situation appears to be about to change with
some preliminary work already <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=277edbabf6fece057b14fb6db5e3a34e00f42f42">merged</a> into 4.6-rc1 and some more
significant improvements being <a
href="/Articles/680876/">prepared</a>
by  power management maintainer Rafael Wysocki for likely inclusion in 4.7: the <tt>schedutil</tt>
<tt>cpufreq</tt> governor.</p>

<p>
  The focus of these patch sets is just to begin the process of
   integration.  They don't present a complete solution, but only a
   couple of steps in the right direction, by creating interfaces for
   linking the scheduler more closely with CPU power management.

<h4>CPU power management in Linux 4.5</h4>

<p>Linux support for power management of CPUs roughly divides into
<tt>cpuidle</tt>, which guides power usage when the CPU is idle, and <tt>cpufreq</tt>,
which governs power usage when it is active.  <tt>cpufreq</tt> drivers
divide into those, like <tt>intel_pstate</tt> and the Transmeta
<tt>longrun</tt>, that choose the CPU frequency themselves using
hardware-specific performance counters or firmware functionality, and
those that need to be told which power level, from a given range of
options, is appropriate at any given time.  This power level is
nominally a CPU frequency but, as it can be implemented by scaling a
high-frequency clock, it is sometimes referred to as a frequency scaling
factor.  It is not uncommon to scale down the voltage together with
the frequency so you can also see terms like DVFS for &quot;Dynamic Voltage
and Frequency Scaling&quot;, or the more generic OPP for &quot;Operating Power
Point&quot;.  For the most part, we will just refer to frequency changes
here.</p> 

<p>The <tt>cpufreq</tt> governors that choose a frequency for the second group
of drivers are also divided into two groups: the trivial and the
non-trivial.  There are three trivial frequency governors:
<tt>performance</tt>, which always chooses the highest frequency,
<tt>powersave</tt>, 
which always chooses the lowest, and <tt>userspace</tt>, which allows a
suitably privileged user-space process to make the decision by writing
to a file in <tt>sysfs</tt>.  The non-trivial governors vary the CPU
frequency based on the apparent system load.  This is quite similar to
the approach used by <tt>intel_pstate</tt>, except that they determine load
from generic information known to the kernel, rather than hardware-specific
counters.</p> 

<p>The statistics used by these governors do come from the scheduler, but
only in a roundabout way that does not reflect the sort of integration that
Molnar hopes for.  The governors set a timer with a delay of some tens or
hundreds of milliseconds and use the CPU-usage statistics (visible in
<tt>/proc/stat</tt>) to determine the average load over that time, which is
the
ratio of busy time for the CPU to total time.  There is some subtlety
to exactly how this number is used but, roughly, the CPU frequency
is increased when the load is above a threshold and
decreased if it is below another threshold.  The two non-trivial
frequency governors differ in their response to increasing load:
<tt>on-demand</tt> will immediately jump to the highest frequency and then
possibly back off as the idle time increases, making it suitable for
interactive tasks, while the
<tt>conservative</tt> governor will scale up more gradually as is fitting
for background jobs.</p>

<h4>Problems with the current approach</h4>

<p>There are various reasons for dissatisfaction with the current
governors.  Probably the easiest to identify is the one that caused the
Android developers to write their own governor: interactive
responsiveness.   An idle CPU will likely be at the lowest
frequency setting.  When a user starts interacting with the device
the CPU will continue at that setting for many milliseconds until the
timer fires and the new load is assessed.  While the <tt>on-demand</tt>
governor does go straight to the maximum frequency, it doesn't do so
immediately, and the delay is both noticeable and undesirable.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/1446069953-9701-1-git-send-email-czoborbalint@gmail.com"><tt>interactive</tt></a> governor for Android is designed to detect this
transition out of idle and to set a much shorter timeout, typically
under ten milliseconds ("<q>1-2 ticks</q>").  A new
frequency is then chosen 
based on the load over this short time range rather than the normal
longer interval.  The result is improved interactive response without the
loss of stability that is likely if all samples were over short time
periods.</p>

<p>Another reason for dissatisfaction is that resetting those timers
frequently on every CPU is far from elegant.  Thomas Gleixner,
maintainer of the timer code, is known not to like them and Wysocki
<a
href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/72589">noted</a>
that "<q>getting rid of those timers allows quite some irritating bugs in
cpufreq to be fixed</q>".</p>

<p>Finally, the information used to guide frequency choice is based
entirely on recent history.  While it is hard to get reliable
information about the future, there is information about the present that
can be useful.  To understand this it is helpful to consider the
different classes of threads as they are seen by the scheduler, which
can be divided into realtime, deadline, or normal.</p>

<p>Of these, threads configured for <a href="/Articles/575497/">deadline scheduling</a> provide the most
information about the future.  Such threads must specify a worst-case
CPU time needed to achieve their goal and a period indicating how
often it will be needed.  From this, it is possible to
calculate the minimum CPU frequency that will allow all deadline
threads to be serviced.  This can be done without any reference to
history.</p>

<p>Realtime threads also provide information about the future, though it
is not so detailed.  When a realtime thread is ready to run,
"<q>the only possible choice the kernel has</q>", as Peter
Zijlstra <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/20160301135811.GQ6356@twins.programming.kicks-ass.net">put it</a>, "<q>is max OPP</q>".  When there is a
realtime thread, but it is currently waiting for something, there are
two options.  If switching to top speed can be done quickly, then it
is safe to ignore the thread until it is runnable, and then instantly
switch to maximum frequency as it starts running.  If switching the CPU
frequency takes a bit longer, then the only really safe thing to do is
to stay at maximum CPU frequency whenever there are any realtime
threads on that CPU.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are the normal threads, those managed by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">Completely
Fair Scheduler</a> (CFS).  While the primary source of information
available to CFS is historical, it is more fine-grained than the
information currently in use.  Using per-entity load tracking, CFS
knows the recent load characteristics of every thread on each CPU and
knows immediately if a thread has exited, a new one has been
created, or if a thread has migrated between CPUs.  This allows a more
precise determination of load, which is 
already being used for scheduling decisions and could usefully be used
for CPU frequency scaling decisions.</p>

<p>CFS can have a little bit more information than historical usage.  It
is possible for a maximum <a href="/Articles/428230/">CPU bandwidth</a> to be imposed on a process
or process group.  CFS could use this to determine an upper limit for
the load generated by those processes and may usefully be able to
provide that information to <tt>cpufreq</tt>.</p>

<h4>Challenges</h4>

<p>Even if all this information were readily available, and some of it
is, making use of it effectively is not necessarily straightforward.
This particularly seems to be the case when working in and around the
scheduler, as that code is quite performance-sensitive.</p>

<p>One challenge that <tt>cpufreq</tt> must face is how exactly to change the
CPU frequency once a decision has been made.  As was hinted at above,
some platforms may allow fast frequency changes but, while that is
true, <tt>cpufreq</tt> doesn't know anything about it.  A <tt>cpufreq</tt> driver
has a single interface, <tt>target_index()</tt>, to set the frequency,
which may take locks or block for other reasons, so it cannot be depended
on to be fast.  An optional non-blocking interface has been proposed,
but it will still be necessary to work with <tt>cpufreq</tt> drivers that
need to be called from &quot;process context&quot;.  This currently means
scheduling a worker thread to effect the frequency change.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/56CF9D8F.7010607@linaro.org">question</a> whether a regular workqueue thread is
really sufficient.  It seems possible that on a busy system, such a
thread might not get scheduled for a while, so at those times, when a
switch to high frequency is most important, it will be most delayed.
The <tt>interactive</tt> governor used by Android has addressed this issue by
creating a realtime thread to perform all frequency changes.  While
this works, it does not seem like an ideal solution for the longer
term.  As noted above, it may be sensible to keep the CPU at maximum
speed whenever there are realtime threads.  In that case, the
existence of a realtime thread for setting the frequency would
prevent it from ever being asked to set a lower frequency.</p>

<p>This is currently an open issue.  Wysocki is not convinced that this
is a real problem in practice, so he is not keen on anything beyond
the current simple approach.  Those who feel otherwise will need to
provide concrete evidence of a problem, which is often a valuable
prerequisite for such changes.</p>

<h4>Two steps forward</h4>

<p>There are two patch sets that have been prepared by Wysocki and look
likely to reach the mainline soon; one has already been included in
4.6-rc1.  There are a number of details in which they differ from
others that have been proposed, such as <a href="/Articles/649593/">scheduler-driven frequency selection</a> originally by
Michael Turquette, but possibly the most important is that they are
incremental steps with modest goals.  They address the issues that can
easily be addressed and leave other more difficult issues for further
research.</p>

<p>The first of these patch sets removed the timers that Gleixner found so
distasteful.  Instead of being triggered by a timeout, re-evaluation
of the optimal setting for <tt>cpufreq</tt> is now triggered by the scheduler
whenever it updates load or runtime statistics.  This will doubtless
be called more often than frequency changes are really wanted, and
possibly more often than it is possible to update the frequency
choice, so the <tt>sampling_rate</tt> number that previously set the timer
is now used to discard samples until an appropriate interval since the
last update has passed.</p>

<p>The new frequency choice is still calculated the same way and it happens
about as often, but one noteworthy change is that the updates are no
longer synchronized with the scheduler &quot;tick&quot; that timers use.  This
change has resulted in one measurable <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/008201d16458$69b2a4f0$3d17eed0$@net">benefit</a> for the <tt>intel_pstate</tt>
driver, which occasionally made poor decisions due to this synchronization.</p>

<p>The second patch set, some of which is up to its eighth revision, makes
two particular changes.  A new, optional <tt>fast_switch()</tt> interface is
added to <tt>cpufreq</tt> drivers so that fast frequency switching can be used
on platforms that support it.  If provided, this must be able to run
from &quot;interrupt context&quot; meaning that it must be fast and may not sleep.  As already discussed, there are times when this can be
quite valuable.</p> 

<p>The other important change is to introduce a new CPU frequency-scaling
governor, <tt>schedutil</tt>, that makes decisions based on utilization as
measured by the scheduler.  The <tt>cpufreq_update_util()</tt> call that
the scheduler makes whenever it updates the load average already
carries information about the calculated load on the current CPU, but
no governor uses that information.  <tt>schedutil</tt> changes that.  It
doesn't change much though.</p>

<p><tt>schedutil</tt> still only performs updates at the same rate as the current
code, so it doesn't try to address the interactive responsiveness
problem, and doesn't try to be clever about realtime or deadline
threads.  All it does is use the load calculated by the scheduler
instead of the average load over the last little while, and optionally
imposes that frequency change instantly (directly from the scheduler
callback) if the 
driver supports it.</p>

<p>This is far from a complete solution for power-aware scheduling, but
looks like an excellent base on which to make <tt>cpufreq</tt> more responsive
to sudden changes in load, and more aware of some of the finer details
that the scheduler can, in theory, provide.</p>

<p>It appears that the long-term goal is to get rid of the selectable
governors completely and just have a single governor that handles all
cases correctly.  It would need to respond correctly to realtime
tasks, deadline tasks, interactive tasks, and background tasks.
These are all concepts that the scheduler must already deal with, so it
is quite reasonable to expect that <tt>cpufreq</tt> can learn to deal with
them too.  It will clearly take a while longer to reach the situation
that Molnar desires, but it seems we are well on the
way.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

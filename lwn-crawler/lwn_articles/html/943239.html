<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 4, 2023</br>
           </div>
The kernel-development community has recently been discussing a number of
independent patches, each of which is intended to help improve the security
of deployed systems in some way.  They touch on a number of areas within the
kernel, including the question of how widely io_uring should be available,
how to allow virtual machines to attest to their integrity, and the best
way to inform applications when their random-number generators need to be
reseeded.
<p>
<h4>Disabling io_uring</h4>
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/776703/">io_uring interface</a> has been a boon to
users striving for the best performance with I/O-heavy workloads; it has
finally given Linux an approach to asynchronous I/O (and more) that the
community can be proud of.  It has also brought a number of
security-related bugs, to the point the Google recently <a
href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/06/learnings-from-kctf-vrps-42-linux.html">described
it</a> as being "<q>safe only for use by trusted components</q>".  It is
thus not surprising that somebody (Matteo Rizzo, in this case) has put
together <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/x49y1i42j1z.fsf@segfault.boston.devel.redhat.com/">a
patch</a> allowing the system administrator to disable io_uring entirely.
<p>
This patch adds a new sysctl knob (<tt>kernel.io_uring_disabled</tt>) that
controls the availability of the io_uring feature.  At the knob's default
value of zero, io_uring remains available as always.  Setting it to one
disables it for unprivileged users, where "privileged" is defined as having
the <tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> capability.  In response to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230726174549.cg4jgx2d33fom4rb@awork3.anarazel.de/">a
request</a> from Andres Freund after a previous posting, Rizzo added
another knob, <tt>kernel.io_uring_group</tt>, that can be set with a group
number; any process that is a member of the indicated group is also allowed
to use io_uring.  Finally, setting <tt>kernel.io_uring_disabled</tt> to two
turns the feature off entirely.
<p>
After five revisions, the patch seems about ready to go into the mainline;
there does not seem to be any real opposition to it.  One might wonder how
long it will really be useful, though.  As Ben Hawkes recently <a
href="https://blog.isosceles.com/what-is-a-good-linux-kernel-bug/">wrote</a>,
the bulk of the io_uring problems may have already been found:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The era of io_uring is probably coming to an end, but it's been a
	very popular area of research recently. It reminds me of the gold
	rush around unprivileged user namespaces. Basically these complex
	new kernel features are consistently more bug-prone than we'd like,
	and this pattern seems to repeat itself every few years.
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case of io_uring, perhaps the worst problems have been found and the
stream of vulnerabilities will begin to taper off.
<p><a name="tsm"></a>
<h4>Virtual-machine attestation</h4>
<p>
The field of confidential computing has put a lot of effort into the
ability to run virtual machines that cannot be compromised or spied upon,
even by the host computer on which those machines are run.  Getting to that
point requires a lot of system hardening, use of encryption, and hardware
that provides features (such as encrypted memory) to protect virtual
machines from the surrounding world.  All that work will be for nothing,
though, if a virtual machine is compromised in some way: if, for example, its
data has been tampered with, or if the hardware features it is depending on
are not really there.
<p>
Users of confidential-computing systems tend to start them and, after
convincing themselves that all is well, entrusting them with the encryption
keys or other secrets they need to get their job done.  For a virtual
machine, convincing an orchestration system is a matter of using the
available integrity-measurement mechanisms and having the CPU attest to its
own integrity using a secret key buried deeply inside.  All of this
information can be signed by a device like a trusted platform module, then
passed out of the machine, where it can be verified externally.
<p>
Numerous vendors are working on this functionality and, naturally, each is
solving the problem in its own way.  This, as Dan Williams noted in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/169342399185.3934343.3035845348326944519.stgit@dwillia2-xfh.jf.intel.com/">this
patch series</a>, is not the best way forward:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The approach of adding adding new char devs and new ioctls, for
	what amounts to the same logical functionality with minor
	formatting differences across vendors, is untenable. Common
	concepts and the community benefit from common infrastructure.
</blockquote>
<p>
Williams is working to provide that infrastructure.  The result is a
configfs interface where the orchestration system can create a directory,
write nonce data to a special file (called <tt>inblob</tt>).  The virtual
machine will then read the nonce data, incorporate it into its attestation
report, and make it available to be read from <tt>outblob</tt>.  The
orchestrator can then verify the signatures and nonce data; if everything
checks out, the machine should be safe to use.
<p>
It's worth noting that this proposal says nothing about the format of the
data written to and read from these configfs files; they are still specific
to the confidential-computing mechanism that is in use.  There is,
evidently, a discussion underway concerning the standardization of this
data, but it is not clear if or when that will happen.  Meanwhile, though,
there will at least be a uniform interface for working with this
information.
<p>
<h4>Random reseeding</h4>
<p>
The kernel's random-number generator is meant to be fast, but it is still
not fast enough for some users.  In such cases, it is common to implement a
pseudo-random-number generator in user space, which is seeded from the
kernel at application startup.  That can work well, but there is a problem:
sometimes the random seed may be in danger of compromise and in need of
replacement.  This can happen, for example, if a virtual machine is
snapshotted and later restored, resulting
in two machines generating the same "random" number series from the same
seed.  This problem was <a href="/Articles/887207/">addressed in the
kernel</a> in 2022, but it remains for user space.
<p>
The kernel is aware of events that may require reseeding a random-number
generator; it is just a matter of making that information available to
interested processes in user space.  A system call to check whether
reseeding is necessary could be added, but that would defeat the purpose of
using the user-space generator in the first place; something faster is
needed.
<p>
The approach currently under consideration can be seen in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230823090107.65749-1-bchalios@amazon.es/">this
short patch series</a> from Babis Chalios.  It allows a process to open
<tt>/dev/random</tt>, invoke a new <tt>ioctl()</tt> to get a
special-purpose file descriptor, then pass that descriptor to
<tt>mmap()</tt> to map a single page of shared memory into the process's
address space.  That page contains a 32-bit value split into two fields: an
eight-bit "notifier ID" and a 24-bit "epoch counter".
<p>
There are numerous notifiers in the kernel that may detect and signal the
need to reseed the random-number generator; each of these is assigned a
unique ID.  Examples of notifiers might include the virtual-machine snapshot
mechanism or a periodic timer.  Whenever a notifier decides that a reseed
is warranted, it increments the epoch counter and writes its own ID into
the notifier-ID field; the combination of the two values ensures that the
full 32-bit value will change with every update regardless of any races
between notifiers.  With this mechanism in place, a user-space process need
only read this value before generating a random number; if it has changed
since the last read, a reseed should happen before anything else.
<p>
Some discussion on the details of the reporting format are still ongoing
(Greg Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/2023082322-semester-heave-e5bc@gregkh/">suggested</a>
using two 32-bit values), but otherwise this mechanism, which was evidently
hashed out at the 2022 Linux Plumbers Conference, appears to be
uncontroversial.  Unless something surprising happens, reseed notifications
should be ready for merging by the time the 6.7 merge window opens.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
One very welcome set of patches. Though I'm not sure how useful that will be in its current state.<br>
The library implementors that deal with those chardevs have much worse problems in that they need to parse the actual blobs, and deal with a lot of different nested vendor-specific structures everywhere.<br>
The chardevs themselves are abstracted away in a couple functions and not heard from again by the rest of the code.<br>
<p>
The content of the blobs themselves, the various options when generating them, and the convoluted mechanisms to verify their validity are vastly more frightening than the weird chardevs, in my humble experience :')<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; This approach later allows for the standardization of the attestation blob format without needing to invent a new ABI. Once standardization happens the standard format can be emitted by $report/outblob and indicated by $report/provider, or a new attribute like "$report/tcg_coco_report" can emit the standard format alongside the vendor format.</span><br>
<p>
... ah, there it is, music to my ears =)<br>
<p>
The problem is that the current outblob is a giant flaming hairball of mud, sprinkled with vendor-specific options, where any operation on the blob involves covering your arms elbow-deep in vendor-specific mud.<br>
The patch does make it easier to get that blob into your hands. A very mild relief washes over me.<br>
<p>
But the real benefit will be if and when the players manage to standardize any part of the format, even if just a few fields at first. Here's to hoping!<br>

Seems critically important that user-space must generate the new (pseudo) random numbers and *then* check for a notification before proceeding. Doing it the other way around would leave open a possible race. That needs to be documented very loudly because it will be easy for user-space to get this wrong.<br>

Then please don't allow this to get merged without a companion *complete* manpage, and a Documentation/ patch.  Hopefully the current patchsets already have it, even: I did not check, because this is a "general" rant post, not anything against this specific feature patchset, and it is not directed at @roc or anyone specific.<br>
<p>
The lack of correct-use and discoverability documentation at feature acceptance is the bane of proper widespread (and correct!) use of a *lot* of interesting kernel functionality.   No matter how much (very appreciated!) effort sites like LWN make to offset this, an online article in a LWN edition has nowhere the same long-term discoverability as appropriate documentation stored at the appropriate location,  especially five or ten years from now.<br>

Well even if you do it like that, the VM could be saved after you got the random value and checked for the reseed but before you used it, so I don't know wether that helps significantly. I think it is more about e.g. having two servers use the same random seed for multiple random values.<br>

Agreed: the explotability of a single predictable random number is heavily limited, especially since security-critical random number generation would probably use the kernel interfaces directly rather than have a userspace generator.<br>

Okay, I poked around OpenSSL, and while it does still have a userspace random number generator, it will automatically reseed from the OS after a certain amount of time (by default).  So if the VM you're spinning up or resuming from hibernation in or whatever has an updated time, I *think* that it will probably be greater than this reseed time and thus trigger a reseed when you attempt to use the data.<br>
<p>
This change will probably just add a new line to the openssl manpage laying out another circumstance that triggers reseeding, but existing systems will hopefully not be devastatingly insecure without it.<br>

Isn't there a race either way?  I'd have thought that the correct way to use it would be something like:<br>
<p>
// global - assume we previously initialized rnd_epoch_ptr<br>
uint32_t rand_epoch = *rnd_epoch_ptr;<br>
<p>
int get_random()<br>
{<br>
   // get random bytes<br>
   int r = call_my_prng();<br>
<p>
   int current_epoch = *rnd_epoch_ptr;<br>
<p>
   while (current_epoch != rand_epoch) {<br>
      rand_epoch = current_epoch;<br>
<p>
      // re-seed the generator<br>
      reseed_my_prng();<br>
<p>
      // regenerate the random bytes<br>
      r = call_my_prng();<br>
<p>
      current_epoch = *rnd_epoch_ptr;<br>
   }<br>
   return r;<br>
}<br>
<p>
I agree with the need for good documentation, since I think the above code still probably isn't correct (eg surely it needs some memory barriers to stop the compiler re-ordering or eliding the reads from *rnd_epoch_ptr) and might have other problems too.<br>

Wouldn't `rnd_epoch_ptr` correctly be marked as `volatile`? Or are the semantics around that not enough either?<br>

I think volatile isn't sufficient.  And once you've got the required memory barriers then volatile isn't necessary.<br>

What Ben said was that since it is being disabled, the age of io_uring is coming to an end, as security-critical systems will disable it.<br>
<p>
The problems with it will remain, and are unlikely to be over any time soon, as going forward there will be less of an incentive to look for them (as it'll be disabled on systems that care about security, and io_uring is not good enough that it can be trusted).<br>

I agree that that is one possible interpretation of what Ben said, but I do not think it is the only interpretation. He could mean that "The initial security problems with this feature have now been found and fixed; there may be a long tail of minor bugs, but we're not likely to see anything like the number of bugs in the future".<br>
<p>
In the context of the whole article where he prioritises Android-affecting bugs but considers enterprise distro bugs almost as important, he doesn't mean "Google have disabled it so problem solved". I'd expect Google to re-enable it in a few years once it's a bit more settled.<br>

<p>
As someone who received and dealt with these reports, I think it's safe to say that the main cause of most of them has long since been eliminated. io_uring initially had some unsafe practices for handling thread offload, for example, which was the main driver of a lot of them. These aren't relevant anymore, even in 5.10-stable. Outside of that, the few recent ones (around spring time) were all issues in older kernels where more prudent rewrites had eliminated those cases in recent kernels.<br>
<p>
So while I don't think the patch from Matteo is particularly interesting now, it would've been earlier. But at the same time, it doesn't hurt, and it makes some peoples lives easier, so...<br>

Yes, I think you are talking about this commit:<br>
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/io_uring?h=linux-5.10.y&amp;id=788d0824269bef539fe31a785b1517882eafed93">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/li...</a> which backported io_uring implementation from 5.15 to 5.10 and hence got rid of issues like <br>
9eac1904d3364254d622bf2c771c4f85cd435fc2<br>
<p>
I believe we've seen similarly serious io_uring bugs more recently though?<br>
a26a35e9019fd70bf3cf647dcfdae87abc7bacea<br>
and 12ad3d2d6c5b0131a6052de91360849e3e154846 for example but here are a couple more:<br>
ef7dfac51d8ed961b742218f526bd589f3900a59<br>
9d94c04c0db024922e886c9fd429659f22f48ea4<br>
fc7222c3a9f56271fba02aabbfbae999042f1679<br>
<p>
Or, do you mean there was another commit on 6.x which also had some unsafe practices for handling thread offload that were refactored away more recently?<br>
<p>

      In answer to my own link, VMGENID is at least mentioned in the patch series:

<pre>
The feature is similar to Microsoft's Virtual Machine Generation ID and
it can be used to (1) avoid the race-condition that exists in our
current VMGENID implementation, between the time vcpus are resumed and
the ACPI notification is being handled and (2) propagate these events to
user space through the random.c epoch mechanism.
</pre>

It's a shame that (1) cannot be fixed, as VMGENID is a widespread mechanism, and covers many more cloning cases than this patch series.

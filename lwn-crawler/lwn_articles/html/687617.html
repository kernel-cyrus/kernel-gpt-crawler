           </div>
Sometimes, when trying to make the kernel work better for specific
workloads, one runs into problems originating in genuinely old code.
Delving into such code can be a daunting task — it has worked for many
years, and tweaking it could have surprising consequences in distant parts
of the kernel.  So it is not surprising that developers can be tempted
to work around a problem in other ways.  Such a situation
recently came up with regard to high-rate networking on small systems; a
look at the problem and its resolution provides a good excuse to dig into
an ancient kernel mechanism: software interrupts or "softirqs".
<p>
<h4>Software interrupts</h4>
<p>
Processing of hardware interrupts is considered to be one of the most
urgent tasks for the kernel; when an interrupt is signaled, the system
drops what it is doing and calls the interrupt handler.  Often, an
interrupt will tell the system that there is more work — such as processing
a completed I/O operation — to be done, but that work should not be done in
the interrupt handler itself.  To handle such cases, the kernel provides a
number of mechanisms for deferred execution; these include workqueues,
tasklets, timers, and software interrupts.
<p>
Of these mechanisms, software interrupts must be about the oldest;
<tt>kernel/softirq.c</tt> starts with a copyright statement from Linus
dated 1992 (though, in truth, that comment may be the only thing that
survives from the <a href="/Articles/687726/"><tt>kernel/softirq.c</tt></a>
that appeared in the 1.2 release).  It is also a mechanism that many developers
will be relatively 
unfamiliar with; most will never interact directly with software
interrupts.  But they play an important role in how many urgent tasks in
the kernel are handled.

</blockquote>
<p>
Essentially, a software interrupt is meant to look like a hardware
interrupt, except that it runs at a lower priority.  Software interrupts
can execute asynchronously and are considered more important than most
other things the kernel can do.  They are, in short, a way to say "do some
work as soon as possible after we finish handling hardware interrupts."
<p>
All known softirqs are hard-coded in the kernel source; there is no
mechanism to add them dynamically.  There are currently ten softirqs
defined, though one of them is not used.  The ones that <i>are</i> used are for
network processing, block request processing, block interrupt polling,
read-copy-update processing, scheduler housekeeping, and tasklet processing
— the tasklet mechanism is a sort of wrapper around the softirq layer.
Each subsystem that uses softirqs registers a handler to be called when an
interrupt is pending; signaling of software interrupts is done with a call
to <tt>raise_softirq()</tt>.
<p>
There are a few places where software interrupt handlers actually get run,
including immediately after a hardware interrupt handler completes.  So
softirqs signaled from interrupt handlers will often be handled almost
immediately.  Softirq processing can be disabled by kernel code (taking a
spinlock will do it, for example); softirq handlers can be run once they
are enabled 
again (once the spinlock is released, for example).  That means that, in
practice, there are many points throughout the 
kernel where softirqs can execute.
<p>
One problem with the softirq mechanism is that it can create arbitrary
latencies at almost any point in the kernel where softirq handlers can be
run; there is often a <i>lot</i> of work that is done in those handlers.  Thus,
developers working on the realtime patches have grumbled about softirqs for
years and have <a href="/Articles/520076/">changed how they are
processed</a> in realtime kernels.  In the mainline kernel, 
this problem has been partially addressed by trying to limit the amount of
time spent processing softirqs.  If any call to <tt>__do_softirq()</tt>
(the function that actually calls softirq handlers) finds itself running
for more than 2ms, processing will stop and the <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> kernel
thread will be woken up to finish the job.  So, if the softirq load gets to
high, it gets pushed into a thread where it has to compete with the rest of
the work the system is doing.
<p>
For the most part, this mechanism works well enough that it has not been
removed, even though a number of developers would like to see it go.  On
the other hand, any attempt to add more softirq sources would almost
certainly encounter strong pushback, which is why new ones are almost never
added.  Anybody thinking about doing so will be directed toward workqueues,
or, if nothing else will suffice, tasklets.
<p>
<h4>Softirqs and NAPI polling</h4>
<p>
The networking subsystem uses two software interrupts, one each for transmit
and receive processing.  The receive softirq is where NAPI processing (the
polling of interfaces for new packets) is done.  If there are a lot of
packets to handle, this processing can take a long time.  As with the
softirq subsystem itself, the networking stack imposes a limit on how much
time it will spend accepting packets in the softirq handler.  That limit,
though, is set to two jiffies — as much as 20ms, depending on the system's
clock speed.  In other words, the networking code increases the maximum
time spent continuously handling softirqs by as much as a factor of ten.
<p>
Of course, one wants the networking stack to have the CPU time it needs to
deal with the flow of packets into the system.  But it is also necessary to
leave sufficient time for user space to actually do something with those
packets.  As Paolo Abeni reported in the introduction to his <a
href="/Articles/686985/">threadable NAPI poll loop patch set</a>, that
doesn't always happen:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Under high network load, the softirq loop can take nearly 100% of a
	given CPU, leaving very little time for use space processing. On
	single core hosts, this means that the user space can nearly
	starve. 
</div>
<p>
His solution was to (at the system administrator's option) move NAPI
processing out of softirqs entirely, and into its own dedicated kernel
thread.  Even if no other configuration is done, this change allows the
scheduler to balance NAPI processing against the needs of the other
runnable threads on the system, giving user space a chance to run.  The
results, Paolo said, are good:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	With the default scheduling policy, the starvation issue observed
	on single vCPU guest under UDP flood is solved and the throughput
	measured under heavy overload is quite stable around the peak
	performance.
</div>
<p>
Paolo's solution looks impressive, but it failed to impress the networking
developers.  Eric Dumazet <a href="/Articles/687629/">rejected the
patch</a>, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We already have ksoftirqd to normally cope with the case you are
	describing.  If it is not working as intended, please identify the
	bugs and fix them, instead of adding yet another tests in fast path
	and extra complexity in the stack.
</div>
<p>
Paolo was not pleased with this response, but he was able to come back with
a bit of important information: why <tt>ksoftirqd</tt>, as it is
implemented in current kernels, is not a sufficient
solution to the problem.
<p>
It seems that <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> will process
packets for the two jiffies allowed by the networking code, then yield so
that user space can run; Paolo estimated that, on his system, about 640
packets would be processed during this time.
Once user space gets a chance to run, it will make a system call to
retrieve a packet; the code implementing the system call will, at some
point, find itself taking and releasing locks.  But the point where a lock
is released is an opportunity for the kernel to do softirq processing, and
that is exactly what happens: softirq processing is done in the calling
process's context.  In Paolo's case, that in-context softirq processing
would handle another 640 packets 
before returning a single packet to user space — the kernel, in other
words, was processing nearly 1,300 packets before letting user space have
even one of them.  That is truly a system that is out of balance.
<p>
To Paolo, this behavior was a good reason to move NAPI processing into a
more controllable context, but Eric's <a
href="/Articles/687630/">response</a> was, simply: "<q>Looks you found
the bug then. Have you tried to fix it?</q>".  After a bit, Eric came up
with <a href="/Articles/687631/">a simple fix</a> of his own.  With the
resulting 
patch, waking up the <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> thread will set a per-CPU flag.
Any code that would fire off softirq processing in process context first checks
that flag; if it is set, the processing is skipped.  This has the effect of
forcing all softirq processing over to <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> once it has been
invoked.
<p>
Paolo <a href="/Articles/687633/">did some testing</a> and reported
performance figures close to what were obtained with his patch.  Even so,
he preferred his patch, but indicated acceptance that it was probably not
going to be merged.  Eric's patch, after some further tweaking, looks
likely to land in 4.7.
<p>
One of Paolo's reasons for taking the approach he did was to avoid any
possible effects on other softirq users.  As Eric <a
href="/Articles/687634/">put it</a>, this was a natural tendency:
"<q>Right, we are networking guys, and we feel that messing with such
core infra is not for us.</q>"  But the long-term maintainability of the
kernel depends on fixing problems where they are found rather than adding
new mechanisms to work around those problems.  In this case, a small
problem would appear to have been correctly fixed.  The rather larger
problem (as seen by some developers) represented by the simple existence of
the softirq code remains untouched, though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Probably due to lack of clarity in the cover letter, the scope of this<br>
patches has been misread. They cover the softirq issue, which has been<br>
the trigger for this work, but they have a wider scope.<br>
<p>
Processing the rx packets inside the ksoftirqd thread poses several<br>
difficulties to the process scheduler to fairly balance the workload and<br>
forbids the bottom layer of the network stack to use i.e. mutex. <br>
<p>
For example, in our experiments an hypervisor hosting VMs receiving a<br>
lot of network traffic fit badly with the ksoftirqd design: the VMs and<br>
vhost threads compete for the cpu time with ksoftirqd on each available<br>
cores, and none of them is able to use 100% of single core, leading to<br>
very unstable and suboptimal throughput.<br>
<p>
Running the rx process in threaded context allows the scheduler to<br>
migrate the napi threads and let both vhost and the qemu process use<br>
completely a core each, which gives relevant performance improvements.<br>

I wonder what effects these changes have on other parts of the kernel. While the networking code seems to have a "special place" in terms of its softirq usage compared to other subsystems, I can imagine the softirq changes also having an indirect effect on different subsystems through the tasklet mechanism. I wonder how many undiscovered performance bottlenecks or possible denial of service attacks have been resolved with this patch, as it appears to solve the general problem case of recursive kernel softirq processing caused by userspace trying to process data yielded from softirq processing.<br>
<p>
Can anyone tell me whether tasklets and such already had their own mitigations for this case? Alternatively, was this bug very specific to the way networking used softirqs?<br>

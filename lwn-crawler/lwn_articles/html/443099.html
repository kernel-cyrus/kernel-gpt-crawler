<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 16, 2011</br>
           </div>
LWN recently <a href="/Articles/441232/">discussed an enhancement to the
seccomp mechanism</a> which would allow applications to restrict their future
access to system calls.  By blocking off some calls altogether and by using
simple, ftrace-style filters to restrict the possible arguments to other
system calls, a process could construct a small sandbox which would
constrain it (and its children) going forward.  Getting support for new security
mechanisms in the kernel is often a challenge, but not this time - almost
all of the reviews are positive.  The biggest complaint seems to be that
the patches are not ambitious enough; at least one developer would like to
see developer Will Drewry shoot for replacing the Linux security module
(LSM) mechanism altogether.
<p>
Ingo Molnar has been a supporter of this work; indeed, he suggested some of
the ideas which led to the current set of patches.  But he is now <a
href="/Articles/443106/">asking Will</a> to be a bit more ambitious in his
goals.  Rather than act as a gatekeeper for system calls, why not implement
the ability to hook into arbitrary kernel events and filter access there?
Those who have watched Ingo over the last couple of years are unlikely to
be surprised to see that he suggests hooking into the perf events subsystem
for this task.  Perf already allows an application to attach to events to
get notifications and counts; adding per-process filter expressions, he
suggests, is a natural evolution of that capability.
<p>
In other words, Ingo suggests dropping the current interface, which is
implemented with <tt>prctl()</tt>, in favor of a perf-based (or, at least,
perf-like) interface which could operate on kernel events.  In principle,
any software event that perf can deal with now (including tracepoints)
could be used, but these events would have to be explicitly modified by
kernel developers to enable this sort of "active" use.  For events modified
in this way, filters written in an expanded language could be provided by
an application.  See <a href="/Articles/443110/">this message from Ingo</a>
for an example of how this sort of functionality might be used.
<p>
One of the biggest advantages of hooking to arbitrary events is that
filters could be applied at the real decision points.  A filter which
allows access to the <tt>open()</tt> system call based on the name of the
file being opened is not truly secure; the application could change the
name between the pre-<tt>open()</tt> check and when <tt>open()</tt>
actually uses it.  Checking at a tracepoint placed more deeply within the
VFS lookup code, instead, would block this sort of attack.  A check placed
in the right location could also be more efficient, replacing several
checks at the system call level. 

<p>
According to Ingo, there are a lot of advantages to providing this sort of
capability.  It would allow, for the first time, security policies to be
set up by unprivileged applications; developers could thus take a more
active role in ensuring the security of their code.  The feature could be
made stackable, allowing multiple application layers to add restrictions.
In fact, he thinks it's such a great idea that he said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I argue that this is the LSM and audit subsystems designed right:
	in the long run it could allow everything that LSM does at the
	moment - and so much more.
</div>
<p>
Someday, he said, event-based filters could simply replace LSM which he <a
href="/Articles/443111/">blamed</a> for a number of ills, including stalled
security efforts, desktop annoyances, infighting, fragmentation, and
"<q>probably *less* Linux security</q>".  Merging the code in its
current form, he said, would take away the incentive to go all the way, so
he'd like to see it reworked along these lines first.
<p>
Needless to say, this idea is not universally popular in the Linux security
module community.  James Morris <a href="/Articles/443113/">supports</a>
the merging of the current patch, which, he says, is a good way to reduce
the attack surface of the system call interface, but, he said, it is the
wrong place for more serious security checks.  Real security policies, he
said, should be done at the LSM level.  Eric Paris <a
href="/Articles/443114/">suggested</a> that the filter capability should be
implemented as an LSM, but he also <a href="/Articles/443116/">pointed
out</a> a key weakness of that approach:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The existence of the LSM and the fact that there exists multiple
	security modules that may or may not be enabled really leads
	application developers to be unable to rely on LSM for security.
	If linux had a single security model which everyone could rely on
	we wouldn't really have as big of an issue but that's not possible.
</div>
<p>
Getting application developers to make use of a Linux-specific security
mechanism is already asking a lot.  Getting them to use a mechanism which
may or may not be present even on Linux systems is even harder; that may be
part of why application developers have never really stepped forward to
provide SELinux policies for their code.  The filtering capability
envisioned by Ingo would be part of the core kernel itself; that alone
could help to make it the "single security model" that Eric was wishing
for.
<p>
Any such outcome is to be found well in the future, though; there are
numerous obstacles to overcome.  The amount of work needed to implement
this capability is not trivial.  Individual tracepoints within the kernel
would have to be evaluated to determine whether making them "active" makes
any sense.  Without a great deal of care, allowing applications to block
operations within the kernel could well introduce security problems of its
own.  Based on past experience, the developers of the existing security
mechanisms in the kernel might oppose the addition of an entirely new
security-related framework.  Even Linus, in the past, has been resistant to
the idea of creating a single security policy mechanism for the kernel.
<p>
For the near future, Will has <a href="/Articles/443118/">indicated</a>
that he will look at implementing the feature along the lines suggested by
Ingo.  Once some code is out there, developers will be able to see its
implications and the debate can start for real.  The chances of the
discussion going on for some time are fairly good.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I would love for some sort of consistent, always available, unprivileged, user space, fined grained, security framework to materialize. Right now sand-boxing code is only looked at as meaning either virtual machines, or virtualized machines. Some of us still think that should mean "operating systems". Resource limits, file systems permissions, user accounts, and process privileges come so very close. There just needs to be that last feature set. There was even that x11 sand-boxing program from awhile back (what was that?) <br>

This is the kind of API that userspace should have. Whether or not the mechanism is the LSM, selinux, ftrace, perf, or whatever really isn't the important issue.<p>

The Google Chrome team managed to implement something resembling this sandbox for WebKit using seccomp, a helper thread, a helper process, and some IPC mechanisms. But seriously, why is it that hard for userspace applications to give up some capabilities?

Such a simple fixed-function syscall restriction API is probably good enough for many restricted tasks, and simpler (to use and to implement / audit) than some of the fancy solutions proposed described in the article. But going all the way to a pure capability-oriented interface along the lines of Capsicum would be even better. Unix already has most of the needed pieces - uniform descriptor-oriented syscalls, mainly - and it is just a matter of fixing things at the edges.<br>

You can implement a pure capability model from userspace. The way to do it is to have some daemons that do the privileged operations on behalf of other processes. This is more or less the route Android went down.<br>
<p>
Ingo's idea is probably a better way to implement LSM than the current implementation. The problem is, we don't really need LSM in the first place. All of the stuff that the NSA wanted to do with security levels and so forth could have been done in a much cleaner way from userspace.<br>
<p>
The point of a sandboxing API is not to construct elaborate policies. It's a tool that makes it easier to implement secure systems in general. Then if people want elaborate policies, they can build that on top.<br>

Those tests are reversed.  This will never return -EACCESS unless you give it a ".." filename.  Hopefully, in real life someone would catch that in testing.<br>

even if this gets implemented, there will still be a need for LSM like frameworks.<br>
<p>
it doesn't really matter how a call to open() is hooked into, what matters is what checks are done, and the checks done for SELinux are going to be very different than the checks done by AppArmor (and they will be looking at very different datastructures to determine if the access should be allowed), even if they are both hooking into the same tracepoints to implement their check.<br>
<p>
I like the concept, it would be a lot of churn for the existing LSM modules to change from using the LSM hooks to using the trace hooks, but if it allows for layered policy enforcers (what have previously been called LSM modules), this would probably make it worth it by itself.<br>

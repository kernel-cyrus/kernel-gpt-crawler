<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2010/">2010 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
There have been many grumblings over the years that kernel releases are
often slower than their predecessors.  One often hears nostalgic longings
for the good old days of 2.6.26, 2.6.18, or even older kernels.  In a
session with no formal leaders, the Kernel Summit attendees were asked to
bring out their "war stories" for discussion.
<p>
Paul Turner, who works on Google's kernel team, started off.  Over time,
Google has had problems with a number of aspects of kernel performance.
Out-of-memory handling is an ongoing source of pain.  The CFS scheduler, he
said, was "merged somewhat aggressively" and caused significant performance
regressions for them.  Google has a couple of difficulties when it comes to
dealing with performance regressions, one of which is the company's habit of
jumping about six kernel versions at a time.  That makes it hard to catch
problems in a timely way or to figure out how they were introduced.  Google
is trying harder to stay up with the mainline, though, so the latest jump
was from 2.6.34 to 2.6.36.  There are indeed some new performance regressions
between the two.  Google's other problem is that it has no way to
demonstrate its workload to the kernel community.  So kernel
developers cannot see Google's performance regressions or know when they
have been fixed. 
<p>
Linus said that identifying that a problem was introduced between 2.6.34
and 2.6.36 is still too broad an interval.  He requested that Google dedicate a
couple of machines to running its workloads on daily snapshots.  When a
performance regression can be narrowed down to a single day's patches, it
is a lot easier to find.  Google's Mike Rubin agreed with all of this,
saying that he would like to set up a group of machines running normal
hardware (instead of Google's special systems) and well-known benchmarks,
with the information publicly available.  Arjan van de Ven noted that Intel
is already doing that kind of work.
<p>
Mike also said that a lot of performance regressions tend to come in
through the virtual filesystem layer.  He also said that Google is seeing
some serious scalability problems there; he would like to see Nick Piggin's
VFS scalability work merged soon.
<p>
How should performance regressions be reported?  The best thing, of course,
is a bisection which fingers the guilty commit.  Doing that requires highly
repeatable tests, though; if a performance benchmark has a 5% variation
between runs, it cannot be used for bisection.  Paul said that Google has
had good results using <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/409680/">linsched</a> for performance
testing. 
<p>
Mike wondered: what do maintainers use to spot performance regression?
Linus responded: "users."  Steve Rostedt chimed in with a plug for his
recently-posted <a href="/Articles/412302/">ktest</a> script.  The real
answer, though, appears to be that a lot of the real performance testing
and fixing is done by distributors when they are working on a new
enterprise kernel release.
<p>
It was noted that tracking down performance regressions can be a problem.
There is rarely a single bug which slows things by 5-15%; instead, there is
a series of 0.5% regressions which all add up.  They can be hard to find,
especially given that little things like the size or layout of the kernel
image can affect things on that scale.  Paul noted that, in one case,
adding three no-op instructions to the end of one function increased
performance by 1.5%.
<p>
As a result, James Bottomley said, kernel developers tend to let a lot of
minor regressions pile up over time.  Then the distributors need to get an
enterprise kernel out, so they put considerable resources into fixing these
regressions, one at a time.  There is no real pooling of information; each
distributor works independently to make things faster.  Ted Ts'o said that
each distributor tends to have a collection of customer workloads which was
obtained under non-disclosure agreements; these workloads are run late in
the process, and any resulting regressions are fixed then.  Those workloads
- and information about them - cannot be shared.
<p>
Other kinds of testing include The Well Known Database Benchmark Which
Cannot Be Named.  It can yield useful results, but it can also take a week
to run.  That, it was dryly noted, can make bisection an even more painful
process than usual.
<p>
James asked: should the kernel community care about small performance
regressions?  After all, there are people out there with big machines, the
resources to run benchmarks on them, and the motivation to submit fixes.
Mike Rubin said that, as long as there is no credible competitor to Linux,
the kernel community maybe doesn't have to care.  Ted said that, if the
community did care more, it might help to get this big users to update
their kernels more often.
<p>
Is there a need for a benchmark summit, a place where kernel maintainers
can share performance data?  Ted said a good start might be to just post
results which can be shared.  Such a summit might be scheduled; if so, it
will probably be associated with the Linux Foundation's Collaboration
Summit in April.

Well, compiler differences are also important :)<br>
<p>
Phoromatic tracker allows you to track only one variable (kernel version), while leaving everything else frozen. They even have support for btrfs snapshots to quickly revert system to a known state.<br>
<p>
But seriously, Phoronix tracker is quite useful now.<br>

I had a brief look at the kernel tracker, and it does look more useful than I remembered. The standard tests there (dbench and so on), and although it looks like a lot of the tests are a bit pointless (basic single-thread cpu-heavy workload), they can probably be disabled.<br>

But the arbitrary mix of operations-per-seconds and seconds-to-complete is very annoying, it means I have to read the fine print on every graph to parse it. Gah!<br>

<p>
Single-threaded benchmarks are not pointless. I had regressions in single-thread workloads caused by 'too clever' locking which had higher overhead than good old lock_kernel.<br>
<p>
Anyway, it's certainly possible to disable uninteresting benchmarks in Phoromatic.<br>

If you got burned by locking changes, I suspect it wasn't a cpu-bound workload to begin with. But if you find them useful, good for you!<br>

Don't confuse the use of the Phoronix Test Suite and the Phoronix Test Suite itself.  I assume you are talking about the reporting on results from particular runs of the Phoronix Test Suite.<br>
<p>
Phoronix Test Suite is just a system to run tests in a repeated manner.  If you keep the compiler consistent between kernels you are only testing the kernel.  People usually raise issues when there are multiple variables changing between systems under tests (some say the kernel, some say the compiler, some say the filesystem).<br>

I'm not sure I'm confusing anything. I wasn't thinking about multiple variables. A number of the tests in the test suite seem to test mainly the compiler optimisations, since they are cpu bound. Hence, pointless (not *wrong*, just not adding any information) for the job to which they are often put. Of course you can argue that this is the users' fault: Let's call it "user education", then, instead of "criticism".<br>

There is a bisection algorithm for intermittent bugs: <a href="http://github.com/ealdwulf/bbchop/">http://github.com/ealdwulf/bbchop/</a>. It probable wouldn't be hard to adapt it for perfornance regressions.<br>

Google's systems are a lot more "special" than they used to be. I suspect they're not real keen on mailing out kernel logs which might reveal exactly how. <br>

</div>
Dave Chinner and Glauber Costa started this LSFMM memory-management track
session by noting that the 
<a href="/Articles/419811/">lockless lookup work</a> in the virtual
filesystem layer was an 
improvement but not a complete solution to the VFS scalability problem.  In
a sense, it has 
simply split up the work across a set of smaller, but still global locks.
The biggest problem has to do with the movement of inodes and directory
entries (dentries) on the LRU lists.  The global locking used there still
does not scale.
<p>
The first step to improve things is to attach those LRU lists to the
filesystem superblock structure.  The locks are still global, but their
scope is now restricted to a single filesystem, reducing contention
somewhat.  But, they said, things need to be broken up further and it's not
clear how that should be done.  There is no desire to go to per-CPU lists;
the overhead of that solution would be too high.  
<p>
There wasn't much discussion of that problem; instead, the bulk of the
session was devoted to a related scalability effort:  Dave's rework of the
shrinker 
mechanism.  Shrinkers are callbacks that can be registered with the memory
management subsystem; they are called when memory is tight in the hope that
they will free up some resources.  There are a number of problems with
shrinkers, starting with the fact that they are a global operation while
most memory problems are localized to a specific zone or NUMA node.  When
things get tight, the memory management code calls the shrinkers as a way
of pounding on the problem with a large hammer in the hope that things get
better.  The result is that the rest of the system, which may not be
suffering memory shortages, gets hammered in the process.
<p>
In addition, there is little agreement over what a call to a shrinker
really means or how the called subsystem should respond.  So there's little
consistency in how the shrinkers behave and, apparently, some fairly scary
code to be found in some of them.
<p>
Dave has a solution in the form of a reworked shrinker API.  It starts with
a generic, per-NUMA-node LRU list that can be adapted to whatever type of object
a specific shrinker needs to manage.  The shrinker interface itself is
built into the list.  The result is the wholesale replacement of a lot of
custom list management and shrinker code.  Shrinkers become a lot more
consistent in their effects and the chances of implementers getting things
wrong are much reduced.
<p>
Glauber added that he could use this interface in his memory control group
("memcg") work.  Reclaim within a memcg is currently limited by the
difficulty in finding objects that are specific to the group in question.
The current shrinker interface also provides no information on what types
of objects to shrink.  If more
dentries are needed, there is little value in shrinking the inode cache.
So it would be nice to have a single entry point that can be adapted to the
memory controller's needs.  He is not concerned with the per-node
capabilities built into the API, but, he said, that API works well and
hides the per-node stuff so that he doesn't need to deal with it.
<p>
Mel Gorman agreed that the proposed new shrinker subsystem seemed to be a
significant improvement.  Shrinkers in their current form, he said, are
effectively random; it is best to avoid calling them whenever possible.  He
did express concerns about the possibility that lock contention could be
introduced, but Glauber responded that it is not really issue since the
locking hierarchy does not actually change much.
<p>

Johannes Weiner asked why the lists were per-node, instead of being tied to
memory management zones.  Dave responded that a per-zone approach would
just increase the number of lists without adding a lot of benefit; most
of the time, when there is a need to free memory, it is sufficient to free
it within any zone on the target node.
<p>
The session came to a close with a more general discussion of the nature of
shrinker callbacks.  It was noted that a lot of kernel developers don't really
understand how the interface works, leading to "a lot of abuse."  But it
also seems that the current API does not match what a lot of users need.
The shrinker API exists to ask a subsystem to free a specific amount of
memory, but what's often wanted, in both kernel and user space, is a simple
indication that memory is getting tight.  So it might be nice to provide
that kind of signal out of the shrinker code, but it's not clear how that
would fit into the new model.
<p>
In any case, the next step is clear: patches are to be posted to the
relevant mailing lists for further discussion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

BPF in the kernel
</div>
In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRFNIKUROPE">linux.conf.au
2017 talk [YouTube]</a> on the eBPF in-kernel virtual machine, Brendan Gregg
proclaimed that "super powers have finally come to Linux". Getting
eBPF to that point has been a long road of evolution and design. While
eBPF was originally used for network packet filtering, it turns out
that running user-space code inside a sanity-checking virtual machine
is a powerful tool for kernel developers and production engineers.

Over time, new eBPF users have appeared to take advantage of its
performance and convenience. This article explains how eBPF evolved
how it works, and how it is used in the kernel.
<p>
<h4>The evolution of eBPF</h4>
<p>
The original <a
href="http://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">Berkeley Packet
Filter (BPF) [PDF]</a> was designed for capturing and filtering network
packets that matched specific rules. Filters are implemented as programs to
be run on a register-based virtual machine.
<p>
The ability to run user-supplied programs inside of the kernel proved
to be a useful design decision but other aspects of the original BPF
design didn't hold up so well. For one, the design of the virtual
machine and its instruction set architecture (ISA) were left behind as
modern processors moved to 64-bit registers and invented new
instructions required for multiprocessor systems, like the atomic
exchange-and-add instruction (XADD). BPF's focus on providing a small
number of RISC instructions no longer matched the realities of modern
processors.
<p>
So, Alexei Starovoitov introduced the <a href="/Articles/599755/">extended
BPF (eBPF)
design</a> to take advantage of
advances in modern hardware. The eBPF virtual machine more closely
resembles contemporary processors, allowing eBPF instructions to be
mapped more closely to the hardware ISA for improved performance.

One of the most notable changes was a move to 64-bit registers and an
increase in the number of registers from two to ten. Since modern
architectures have far more than two registers, this allows parameters
to be passed to functions in eBPF virtual machine registers, just like
on native hardware. Plus, a new <tt>BPF_CALL</tt> instruction made it possible
to call in-kernel functions cheaply.
<p>
The ease of mapping eBPF to native instructions lends itself to
just-in-time compilation, yielding improved performance. The
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=bd4cf0ed331a275e9bf5a49e6d0fd55dffc551b8">original
patch that added support for 
eBPF</a> in the 3.15 kernel showed that eBPF was up to four times faster on
x86-64 than 
the old classic BPF (cBPF) implementation for some network filter
microbenchmarks, and most were 1.5 times faster.
Many architectures support the just-in-time (JIT) compiler (x86-64, SPARC,
PowerPC, ARM, arm64, MIPS, and s390).

<p>


Originally, eBPF was only used internally by the kernel and cBPF programs
were translated seamlessly under the hood. But with <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=daedfb22451dd02b35c0549566cbb7cc06bdd53b">commit
daedfb22451d</a> in 2014, the eBPF virtual machine was <a
href="/Articles/603983/">exposed directly to user space</a>.
<p>
<h4>What can you do with eBPF?</h4>
<p>
An eBPF program is "attached" to a designated code path in the kernel.
When the code path is traversed, any attached eBPF programs are
executed. Given its origin, eBPF is especially suited to writing
network programs and it's possible to write programs that attach to a
network socket to filter traffic, to classify
traffic, and to run network classifier actions. It's even possible to modify the settings of an
established network socket with an eBPF program.

The <a href="https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp">XDP project</a>, in
particular, uses eBPF to do high-performance packet processing by
running eBPF programs at the lowest level of the network stack,
immediately after a packet is received.
<p>
Another type of filtering performed by the kernel is restricting which
system calls a process can use. This is done with <a
href="/Articles/656307/">seccomp BPF</a>.
<p>
eBPF is also useful for debugging the kernel and carrying out
performance analysis; programs can be attached to tracepoints,
kprobes, and perf events. Because eBPF programs can access kernel data
structures, developers can write and test new debugging code without
having to recompile the kernel. The implications are obvious for busy
engineers debugging issues on live, running systems. It's even
possible to use eBPF to debug user-space programs by using <a
href="http://blog.memsql.com/bpf-linux-performance/">Userland
Statically Defined Tracepoints</a>.
<p>
The power of eBPF flows from two advantages: it's fast and it's safe.
To fully appreciate it, you need to understand how it works.
<p>
<h4>The eBPF in-kernel verifier</h4>
<p>
There are inherent security and stability risks with allowing user-space
code to run inside the kernel. So, a number of checks are
performed on every eBPF program before it is loaded.

The first test ensures that the eBPF program terminates and does not
contain any loops that could cause the kernel to lock up.
This is checked by doing a depth-first search of the program's control
flow graph (CFG). Unreachable instructions are strictly prohibited;
any program that contains unreachable instructions will fail to load.
<p>
The second stage is more involved and requires the verifier to
simulate the execution of the eBPF program one instruction at a time.
The virtual machine state is checked before and after the execution of
every instruction to ensure that register and stack state are valid.
Out of bounds jumps are prohibited, as is accessing out-of-range data.
<p>
The verifier doesn't need to walk every path in the program, it's
smart enough to know when the current state of the program is a subset
of one it's already checked. Since all previous paths must be valid
(otherwise the program would already have failed to load), the current
path must also be valid. This allows the verifier to "prune" the
current branch and skip its simulation.
<p>
The verifier also has a "secure mode" that prohibits pointer
arithmetic. Secure mode is enabled whenever a user without the
<tt>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</tt> privilege loads an eBPF program. The idea is to make
sure that kernel addresses do not leak to unprivileged users and that
pointers cannot be written to memory.

If secure mode is not enabled, then pointer arithmetic is allowed but only
after additional 
checks are performed. For example, all pointer accesses are checked
for type, alignment, and bounds violations.
<p>
Registers with uninitialized contents (those that have never been
written to) cannot be read; doing so cause the program load to fail.
The contents of registers R0-R5 are marked as unreadable across
functions calls by storing a special value to catch
any reads of an uninitialized register. Similar checks are done for
reading variables on the stack and to make sure that no instructions write to
the read-only frame-pointer register.
<p>
Lastly, the verifier uses the eBPF program type (covered later) to
restrict which kernel functions can be called from eBPF programs and which
data structures can be accessed.  Some program types are allowed to
directly access network packet data, for example.
<p>
<h4>The bpf() system call</h4>
<p>
Programs are loaded using the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><tt>bpf()</tt> system
call</a> with the 
<tt>BPF_PROG_LOAD</tt> command. The prototype of the system call is:
<p>
<pre>
    int bpf(int cmd, union bpf_attr *attr, unsigned int size);
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>bpf_attr</tt> union allows data to be passed between the kernel and
user space; the exact format depends on the <tt>cmd</tt> argument. The
<tt>size</tt> 
argument gives the size of the <tt>bpf_attr</tt> union object in bytes.
<p>
Commands are available for creating and modifying eBPF maps; maps are the
generic key/value data structure used for 
communicating between eBPF programs and the kernel or user space. Additional
commands allow attaching eBPF programs to a control-group directory or socket
file descriptor,  iterating over all maps and programs, and pinning eBPF
objects to files 
so that they're not destroyed when the process that loaded
them terminates (the latter is used by the tc classifier/action code
so that eBPF programs persist without requiring the loading process to
stay alive).

The full list of commands can be found in the <tt>bpf()</tt> man
page.
<p>
Though there appear to be many different commands, they can be
broken down into three categories: commands for working with eBPF
programs, working with eBPF maps, or commands for working with both
programs and maps (collectively known as objects).
<p>
<h4>eBPF program types</h4>
<p>
The type of program loaded with <tt>BPF_PROG_LOAD</tt> dictates four
things:
where the program can be attached,
which in-kernel helper functions the verifier will allow to be called,
whether network packet data can be accessed directly, and the type of
object passed as the first argument to the program. In fact, the
program type essentially defines an API.
New program types have even been created purely to distinguish between
different lists of allowed callable functions
(<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB</tt> versus
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER</tt>, for example).
<p>
The current set of eBPF program types supported by the kernel is:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER</tt>: a network packet filter
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_KPROBE</tt>: determine whether a kprobe should fire or not
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_CLS</tt>: a network traffic-control classifier
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_ACT</tt>: a network traffic-control action
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACEPOINT</tt>: determine whether a tracepoint should
     fire or not 
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP</tt>: a network packet filter run from the
     device-driver receive path 
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_PERF_EVENT</tt>: determine whether a perf event handler
     should fire or not 
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB</tt>: a network packet filter for control
     groups 
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK</tt>: a network packet filter for
     control groups that is allowed to modify socket options
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_*</tt>: a network packet filter for lightweight tunnels
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS</tt>: a program for setting socket parameters
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_SKB</tt>: a network packet filter for forwarding packets
     between sockets
<li> <tt>BPF_PROG_CGROUP_DEVICE</tt>: determine if a device operation should be
     permitted or not
</ul>
<p>
As new program types were added, kernel developers discovered a need
to add new data structures too.
<p>
<h4>eBPF data structures</h4>
<p>
The main data structure used by eBPF programs is the eBPF map,
a generic data structure that allows data to be passed back
and forth within the kernel or between the kernel and user space. As
the name "map" implies, data is stored and retrieved using a key.
<p>
Maps are created and manipulated using the <tt>bpf()</tt> system call. When a
map is successfully created, a file descriptor associated with that
map is returned. Maps are normally destroyed by closing the
associated file descriptor.

Each map is defined by four values: a type, a maximum number of elements, a
value size in bytes, and a key size in bytes. There are different map
types and each provides a different behavior and set of tradeoffs:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH</tt>: a hash table
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY</tt>: an array map, optimized for fast lookup
     speeds, often used for counters
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY</tt>: an array of file descriptors
     corresponding to eBPF programs; used to implement jump tables and
     sub-programs to handle specific packet protocols
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY</tt>: a per-CPU array, used to implement
     histograms of latency
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY</tt>: stores pointers to <tt>struct
     perf_event</tt>, used to read and store perf event counters
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGROUP_ARRAY</tt>: stores pointers to control groups
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_HASH</tt>: a per-CPU hash table
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH</tt>: a hash table that only retains the
     most recently used items
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_PERCPU_HASH</tt>: a per-CPU hash table that only
     retains the most recently used items
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE</tt>: a longest-prefix match trie, good for
     matching IP addresses to a range
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE</tt>: stores stack traces
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY_OF_MAPS</tt>: a map-in-map data structure
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH_OF_MAPS</tt>: a map-in-map data structure
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVICE_MAP</tt>: for storing and looking up network device
     references
<li> <tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_SOCKET_MAP</tt>: stores and looks up sockets
     and allows socket redirection with BPF helper functions
</ul>
<p>
All maps can be accessed from eBPF or user-space programs using the
<tt>bpf_map_lookup_elem()</tt> and 
<tt>bpf_map_update_elem()</tt> functions. Some map types, such as socket maps,
work with additional eBPF helper functions that perform special tasks.
<p>
<h4>How to write an eBPF program</h4>
<p>
Historically, it was necessary to write eBPF assembly by hand and use
the kernel's <tt>bpf_asm</tt> assembler to generate BPF bytecode.
Fortunately, the LLVM Clang compiler has grown support for an eBPF backend that
compiles C into bytecode. Object files containing this bytecode can
then be directly loaded with the <tt>bpf()</tt> system call and
<tt>BPF_PROG_LOAD</tt> command.
<p>
You can write your own eBPF program in C by compiling with Clang
using the <tt>-march=bpf</tt> parameter. There are plenty of eBPF program
examples in the kernel's <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.14.2/source/samples/bpf"><tt>samples/bpf/</tt></a>
directory; the majority have a "<tt>_kern.c</tt>" suffix in their file name.
The object file (eBPF bytecode) emitted by Clang needs to be
loaded by a program that runs natively on your machine (these samples
usually have "<tt>_user.c</tt>" in their filename). To make it easier to write
eBPF programs, the kernel provides the <tt>libbpf</tt> library, which includes
helper functions for loading programs and creating and manipulating
eBPF objects.

For example, the high-level flow of an eBPF program and user program
using <tt>libbpf</tt>
might go something like:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> Read the eBPF bytecode into a buffer in your user application and
     pass it to <tt>bpf_load_program()</tt>.
<li> The eBPF program, when run by the kernel, will call
     <tt>bpf_map_lookup_elem()</tt> to find an element in a map and store a
     new value in it.
<li> The user application calls <tt>bpf_map_lookup_elem()</tt> to read out the
     value stored by the eBPF program in the kernel.
</ul>
<p>
However, all of the sample code suffers from one major drawback: you
need to compile your eBPF program from within the kernel source tree.
Luckily, the BCC project was created to solve this problem. It includes
a complete toolchain for writing eBPF programs and loading them
without linking against the kernel source tree.

The introduction may let the reader think eBPF was first to propose this kind of functionalities in Linux. This is a bit unfair to the other solutions, notably SystemTap which is available since many years (1.0 was released in 2009) while things were more difficult (no tracepoints, optimizing compilers were unable to emit correct debug symbols). SystemTap is fully usable with a 3.10 kernel and not too old GCC (GCC 4.x I think). In 2013, I was able to profile PHP scripts with SystemTap on production systems using only debug symbols.<br>

To be fair, SystemTap relies on dynamically building kernel modules. This make it impossible to use in many situations (embedded devices, signed kernels with secure boot, etc.), while eBPF is completely stand-alone. <br>

"However, all of the sample code suffers from one major drawback: you need to compile your eBPF program from within the kernel source tree. Luckily, the BCC project was created to solve this problem. It includes a complete toolchain for writing eBPF programs and loading them without linking against the kernel source tree."<br>
<p>
Is this true?  Last I tried to use bcc on a test machine, I got something like:<br>
<p>
  $ /usr/share/bcc/tools/stackcount ...<br>
  chdir(/lib/modules/4.15.0-rc1-29619/build): No such file or directory<br>
  Failed to compile BPF module<br>
<p>
until I'd copied my build tree to my test machine and pointed that symlink at it.<br>

      Thanks, that's interesting.  Looking at the bcc documentation on the Ubuntu package database.... It looks like the headers package you need on Ubuntu is linux-headers-$(uname -r), which contains the entire kernel source tree, and is specific to the running kernel.

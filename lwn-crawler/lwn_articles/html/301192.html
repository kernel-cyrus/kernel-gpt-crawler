<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman was tagged as the "maintainer of crap" at this year's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/298570/">Kernel Summit</a> for his
willingness to shepherd drivers of lower quality into the mainline.  He has
not shrunk from that label, when introducing a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/300890/">patch set</a> that would merge some
of those drivers.  In fact, he has embraced the label: as part of his
patch, he introduced the 
<tt>TAINT_CRAP</tt> flag for use in tainting kernels that load these, well,
crappy drivers.
</p>

<p>
There has been an <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/270960/">ongoing
struggle</a> between those who want to see drivers get included as quickly
as possible versus those who want to see them approach or attain normal
kernel quality levels first.  Kroah-Hartman started the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/285594/">-staging tree</a> last June as a way
to increase the visibility, thus testing and bug fixing, of out-of-tree
drivers.  Because drivers in that tree have been steadily
improving&mdash;to the point where several have graduated to the
mainline&mdash;the belief is that moving -staging itself into the mainline
kernel will result in even faster progress.
</p>

<p>
So, Kroah-Hartman has introduced a new directory (<tt>drivers/staging</tt>)
to hold these drivers, as well as a mechanism to automatically taint the
kernel if any of them get loaded.  That will warn users when loading the
module&mdash;at least if they check their logs&mdash;and include that info
in any oops message that kernel might produce.  Kernel
hackers can then filter out problems depending on what
the taint is&mdash;problems in kernels tainted with binary-only drivers are
generally 
actively ignored. 
</p>

<p>
Getting those drivers into the mainline, though, will make it much easier
for folks who want to test them.  In addition, clean-ups and fixes
for the drivers will go in as mainline patches, raising the
visibility of the developers working on them.  The change should have very
minimal impact on other kernel users and developers.  In particular,
developers will not 
have to worry about reflecting API changes into <tt>drivers/staging</tt> as
Kroah-Hartman will keep them up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
The main <a href="/Articles/301281/">complaint</a> about the proposal has
been that it
duplicates the functionality or intent of the <tt>EXPERIMENTAL</tt> flag.
There was also some belief that tainting the kernel was unduly harsh, but
as Kroah-Hartman <a href="/Articles/301290/">points out</a>: "<q>It
isn't costing 
anything, and if a developer doesn't want to debug the kernel if such a
driver is loaded, this allows them to do this.</q>" 
</p>

<p>
As part of the thread, Paul Mundt <a href="/Articles/301293/">explains why
<tt>EXPERIMENTAL</tt> has no meaning</a> in the kernel today:
<div class="BigQuote">
EXPERIMENTAL today is pretty damn meaningless. What it tends to mean in
practice is that somethings needs some more testing, someone wants to be
able to pull out the EXPERIMENTAL card when someone enables their option
and their kernel blows up, the option/feature hasn't been around in the
kernel for that long, or someone has just been too lazy to remove the
flag (this last one probably covers about 90% of in-tree cases today).
Stuff that is actively broken (in case of your kernel blowing up, not
building, etc.) tends to be shoved under BROKEN instead.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Mundt goes on to show the default configurations almost all enable
<tt>CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL</tt>, further reducing its meaning.  It would
be nice to audit all of the uses and restore the meaning of the flag, but
that is beyond the scope of what Kroah-Hartman has set out to do.  There
still would be a difference, though, even if EXPERIMENTAL were meaningful.
Mundt continues:
<div class="BigQuote">
The other key difference is that even with experimental stuff in the
kernel, you will still get support, so it's not really a taintable
offense. Stuff in staging/ on the other hand while potentially not
actively hostile against the rest of the system, is still very much an
unknown, and therefore the only safe thing to do is to taint the system
and allow individual developers to make a choice regarding whether any
resulting oopses are worth looking at or not.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are still some who are concerned about adding
less-than-kernel-quality code. Randy 
Dunlap <a href="/Articles/301307/">puts it this way</a>: "<q>I think that we
have enough quality problems without adding crap.</q>"  But, Linus Torvalds
has always been solidly in the "merge early" camp, so this proposal 
seems likely to go in for 2.6.28.  Besides, as
Stefan Richter <a href="/Articles/301309/">notes</a>: 
<div class="BigQuote">
OTOH many if not most of the -staging drivers are ones which are 
already in use.  Their users already deal with whatever quality problems 
these drivers have, in addition to having to fight with the installation 
hassles that are inherent to out-of-tree drivers.
</div>
</p>

<p>
In a fairly short span of time, merging drivers into the mainline has
gotten a whole lot easier.  At one time, developers might have to work on a
driver for several development cycles before it reached a quality level
that would allow it to be merged.  In the interim, the -staging tree
made things easier and more visible for testers and developers; soon that
visibility will rise substantially again.

Unfinished and broken drivers should not be in the vanilla kernel. They should be collected and made available as a single megapatch, for the purpose of seeing what is there and making it practical to reach a wide audience, but the mainline should not be plagued with such menaces. Having a -staging tree is good and is the reason those drivers get developed - if the drivers go mainstream too soon, development will not increase but decrease. That has always been the way it works.<br>

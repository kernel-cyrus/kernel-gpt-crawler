           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 10, 2017</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, just over 7,600 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline repository for the 4.13 kernel release â€” and the patch
rate does not look like it will be slowing down anytime soon.  It will be
another busy development cycle but, as has often been the case recently,
many of the changes are internal cleanups that will not be visible to most
users.  That said, there are a number of interesting new features in this
release.
<p>
Some of the most prominent user-visible changes include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Support for <a href="/Articles/724198/">non-blocking buffered I/O
     operations</a> has been added at the block level.  This, in turn, will
     help to improve asynchronous I/O
     support when used with buffered I/O.
<p>
<li> The virtual filesystem and block layers have gained support for
     "lifetime hints"; these hints can be set on an open file using the 
     <tt>fcntl()</tt> system call.  The legal values are
     <tt>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_SHORT</tt>, for data that is not expected to stay
     around for a while, through to <tt>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_EXTREME</tt> for
     data that is expected to last forever.  The idea is that the storage
     device can use this information to optimally place the data; thus far,
     only the NVMe driver actually makes use of this information.
<p>
<li> The <tt>perf</tt> tool has a new <tt>--smi-cost</tt> option to measure
     the cost of system-management interrupts.
<p>
<li> The s390 architecture now supports five-level page tables.  That means
     it can now support up to 16EB of RAM, which should be enough for a
     year or two.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/673641/">next-interrupt prediction patches</a>
     have been merged, hopefully bringing better power-management decisions
     with them.
<p>
<li> While the <a href="/Articles/692704/">conversion of the kernel's
     documentation to reStructured 
     Text</a> is not complete, an important milestone was reached for 4.13: all
     of the old DocBook template files have been converted, and support for
     the DocBook toolchain has been removed.
<p>
<li> Ubuntu has been carrying a long list of enhancements to the AppArmor
     security module out-of-tree for some time.  In 4.13, the core "domain
     labeling" code has been merged into the mainline.  There is still
     quite a bit of AppArmor code yet to be upstreamed but, with the core
     code in place, it should be possible to consider that code in future
     merge windows.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/722293/">structure randomization plugin</a> is
     now part of the build system.  It can be used to randomize the layout
     of the fields in structures at build time, hopefully adding some
     security to the system.
<p>
<li> The kernel now generates and assigns a unique ID number for each BPF
     program and map; these IDs can be used to obtain file descriptors for
     those objects in user space.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/95b9afd3987f91c09151158279e165276a95c597">This
     commit</a> contains a test program that demonstrates this feature's use.
<p>
<li> There is a new BPF program type, <tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS</tt>,
     which can be invoked at various points in a socket's lifecycle to
     tweak a number of connection parameters.  Naturally, the developers
     didn't want to spoil the fun by documenting this feature, but they did
     let some details slip in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/bcdb239b456265b927a809c4078f0a1f433a6e18">this
     commit message</a>.
<p>
<li> The <tt>tcp_sack</tt>, <tt>tcp_window_scaling</tt>, and
     <tt>tcp_timestamps</tt> sysctl knobs are now maintained separately for
     each network namespace.
<p>
<li> A <a href="/Articles/666509/">kernel-based TLS implementation</a> has
     been merged, enabling better performance for protocols like HTTPS.
<p>
<li> The new <tt>SO_PEERGROUPS</tt> command for <tt>getsockopt()</tt> will
     return a list of all groups that the socket peer is a member of.
<p>
<li> Zoned block devices have different rules to writing to different parts
     of the device.  For example, one zone may only allow writes to
     consecutive blocks.  The <tt>dm-zoned</tt> device-mapper module will
     make a zoned block 
     device look like a normal block device, hiding the zoned device's
     inherent write constraints in the process.  Some information can be
     found in <a
     href="/Articles/727501/">Documentation/device-mapper/dm-zoned.txt</a>. 
<p>
<li> The first step in a <a href="/Articles/717707/">long-term plan</a> to
     improve the swapping of transparent huge pages has been merged.  In
     current kernels, huge pages are split into small pages as nearly the
     first step in swapping them out.  In 4.13, that splitting will be
     delayed until after swap space has been allocated and the swap-cache
     accounting done.  That reduces lock contention and, it is claimed,
     leads to a 15% performance improvement.  The plan is to further delay
     the split in the future until huge pages can be directly written to
     and read from the swap device.

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> There are many uses for <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">universally
     unique identifiers</a> (UUIDs) in the kernel.  There are now two
     standard types for UUIDs: <tt>uuid_t</tt> and <tt>guid_t</tt>,
     replacing the <tt>uuid_be</tt> and <tt>uuid_le</tt> types used in some
     parts of the kernel previously.  Various helper functions have been
     gathered and added to <tt>&lt;linux/uuid.h&gt;</tt>, and a number of
     kernel subsystems have been updated to use the new API.
<p>
<li> The block-layer error-code refactoring described in <a
     href="/Articles/724307/">this article</a> has been merged.
<p>
<li> The read-copy-update <a href="/Articles/558284/">full-system idle
     detection</a> mechanism has been removed, since nothing uses it.  The
     <a href="/Articles/202847/">sleepable RCU</a> implementation has also
     been removed since it no longer seems to be needed.
<p>
<li> The new <tt>CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL</tt> configuration option can be used
     to select a version of the <tt>refcount_t</tt> reference-count
     implementation that drops the overflow tests to gain a bit more
     performance.  By default, this option is enabled.
<p>
<li> The new "mux" driver subsystem provides support for multiplexer
     controllers that manage multiple devices.
<p>
<li> The SPI driver subsystem has gained support for SPI slave mode.
</ul>
<p>

By the usual schedule, the 4.13 merge window should close on July&nbsp;16,
with the final 4.13 release due in the first half of September.  In other
words, developers who are planning on attending the Linux Plumbers
Conference or the North America Open Source Summit will want to be prepared
for the merge window to be open during the events.
<p>
A followup article, covering the rest of the 4.13 merge window, will be
posted after the 4.13-rc1 release happens.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Left? No, no, the humans were uploaded into the kernel. drivers/ isn't *hardware* drivers: it's where the people driving the kernel development are stored. (There's no other explanation for its being that many lines long.)<br>
<p>
A lot of them have neural connection maps inside the amdgpu directory (that's what all those abstruse numbers in the alleged register dumps are for).<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The sleepable RCU implementation has also been removed since it no longer seems to be needed.</font><br>
<p>
Just a clarification; It's the classic SRCU that's removed -- tree/tiny SRCU is still around.<br>

Will a man page format for documentation reappear at some point?  DocBooks generally may be unmourned, but the mandocs were a link with Unix tradition and handy for quick lookups.<br>

      Getting man pages back is on my list.  It shouldn't be that hard, really, it's just a matter of taking some time to make it work.  Almost nobody has complained, which tends not to motivate effort in this area...  We'll get there.

Actually, it isn't "non-blocking buffered I/O" patch set that got merged but "non-blocking direct I/O"...<br>

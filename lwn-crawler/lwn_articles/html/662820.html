A "device" as seen by a user of a modern system is, often as not, a set of
multiple independent devices working together.  This organization is
flexible, but it also can lead to problems for device drivers.  How does a
driver instantiate a new device if the other devices it depends on are not
yet available?  One answer is deferred probing — delaying the setup of a
device until its dependencies show up.  Mark Brown led a somewhat
inconclusive Kernel Summit session on deferred probing and possible
alternatives.
<p>
The core problem, Mark said, is that there is no way to tell the kernel's
device model about dependencies between devices.  Rafael Wysocki responded
that the real issue is dependencies between <i>drivers</i>, but Mark
disagreed, saying that a dependency shows itself as one device waiting for

another specific device to be instantiated.  He noted that there is
currently <a href="/Articles/658690/">a deferred probing patch set</a>
under discussion, but it doesn't address the full problem.  In particular,
it doesn't address suspend/resume operations (when devices must be
suspended and resumed in the proper order), and it does nothing to speed
boot time.
<p>
Grant Likely said that the problem is with the tree-oriented device model,
which is not able to describe the dependencies in real-world systems.  This
point was generally agreed — it has been understood for a while — but
solutions are still hard to come by.  Greg Kroah-Hartman described deferred
probing as a "hack workaround" for the problem, but didn't immediately
offer a less hacky alternative.
<p>
There was some talk about the nature of device dependencies.  Some of them
are described in the system's firmware (or device tree).  Others only show
up  when
drivers initialize themselves and can't be seen at boot time.  Dependencies
can even 
change over the lifetime of the system as devices are configured in
different ways.  Tim Bird suggested using the <a
href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Device_Tree_Hacking#Phandle_Properties">phandles</a>
(inter-device references) found in the system's device tree; there is a lot
of dependency information to be found there.  Most dependencies are "stupid
clocks and regulators"; creating a graph of such dependencies prior to
device probing would solve a lot of problems, he said.
<p>
Greg, despite his earlier comment on deferred probing, now asked whether a
more complex dependency graph was needed.  Nobody has demonstrated real
problems resulting from excessive deferral of device probing.  Tim said
that readily available dependency information could at least be used to
perform hinting; Rafael agreed that pulling together as much information as
possible would help the kernel to get the probing order roughly right.
<p>
As a whole, the group seemed to agree that the problem is real, and that it
should somehow be solved in the driver core.  An important first step would
be to 
come up with a way to register dependencies from the information that is
already available.  Rafael promised to post a proposal with some ideas; he

      <i>Rafael Wysocki responded that the real issue is dependencies between drivers</i>

<p>It is not exactly what Rafael said I believe. What Rafael said is that dependencies are not just between devices, but between devices that are actually *bound* to a driver to manage them. Indeed if a device A needs another device B, it doesn't just need this device B to have its platform_device registered. It also needs device B to be bound to a device driver, of which the -&gt;probe() method has been called to actually do something with device B, so that it can be used by device A.</p>

<p>So device A -&gt;probe() should ideally only be triggered when device B -&gt;probe() has completed. Having device B "registered" is not sufficient.</p>

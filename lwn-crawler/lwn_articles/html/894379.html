<h1>Recent RCU changes</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">

<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
In a combined filesystem and memory-management session at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM), Paul McKenney
gave an update on
the changes to the read-copy-update (RCU) subsystem that had been made over
the last several years.   He started with a quick overview of what RCU is
and why it exists at all. He did not go into any
real depth, though, since many of the topics could take a&nbsp;90-minute session of their
own, he said, but he did provide some descriptions of the work that has gone into
RCU recently.
</p>

<p>
RCU is still under active development, McKenney said, which came as a big
surprise to an academic person he was talking to at a conference a few
years back. He did not have the heart to tell him that locking and atomic
operations were also under active development, he said to laughter.  "But
here we are."
</p>

<h4>RCU review</h4>

<a href="/Articles/894523/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/lsfmm-mckenney-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5
align="right" alt="[Paul McKenney]" title="Paul McKenney" width=250
height=300>
</a>

<p>
The overall problem is that global agreement in an operating system like
Linux is expensive.  While it would have shocked his 50-years-ago self, it
turns out that the speed of light is too slow and atoms are too big; those things
are causing massive problems in concurrent software these days.  The way
that is handled by RCU is to synchronize both in time and in space, he
said.  The core RCU API is split into two sets of temporal and spatial
calls.
RCU is a way to allow readers of a data structure to continue working with
it while an updater makes a change; RCU is most often used with linked lists
of various sorts.
</p>

<p>
He showed a slide with four quadrants that described how RCU works on the
temporal side.  The basic idea is that readers call
<tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> before they read the data and
<tt>rcu_read_unlock()</tt> after they are done.  That allows an updater to
remove the locked data, so long as it calls <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt> (or
receives the callback it set up with <tt>call_rcu()</tt>)
before it actually frees it.  The old data may still be in use by a reader,
but RCU guarantees that all readers have unlocked it before it will return
from <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt>.  The four quadrants show
the possible orderings of a reader's lock/unlock and an updater's removal
of the data, <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt>, and the freeing of the old data.
The one that could lead to serious misbehavior, where the removal is done
after the lock and the freeing of 
the old memory is done before the 
unlock, is prevented by RCU.  If that actually happens, it is a bug
in RCU, he said.
</p>

<p>
He also looked at the global agreement cost, contrasting the use of a
reader-writer lock with that of RCU.  When an updater wants to change the
data using a reader-writer lock, there is a period of time before that lock
has propagated to each of the readers, then the update can be done, but
there is another lag waiting for that update to reach all of the readers.
During all of that time, the readers are stalled waiting to be able to read again.
Using RCU, that same time period is no longer wasted.  Readers can
continue, possibly with an outdated version of the data, while updaters
just need to wait until the end of the grace period to ensure that all
subsequent readers will see the new data.
</p>

<p>
He showed some graphs to explain why the complexity of RCU is tolerated.
RCU performs better than a reader-writer lock and it scales a <i>lot</i>
better as the number of threads goes up.  In addition, the shorter the
critical section and the more CPUs there are, the better RCU looks, he
said.  RCU can also prevent some deadlocks.
</p>

<p>
More information about RCU can be found in the LWN kernel index <a
href="/Kernel/Index/#Read-copy-update">entry for RCU</a>.  A
good starting point is "<a href="/Articles/777036/">The RCU API, 2019
edition</a>". 

<h4>Changes</h4>

<p>
That ended his "full-speed review of RCU".  He put up a list of eight
changes to RCU that he wanted to talk about; he would guess at which of
those were the most important to the audience and dig into them a bit
deeper.  He began with flavor consolidation.
</p>

<p>
One day back in 2018, he got an email from Linus Torvalds, with a CC to
security@kernel.org, that described an exploit in a use case of RCU.  The
problem was that the readers were using the <tt>*_sched()</tt> flavor for
locking, but the updater was using <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt> (instead of
<tt>synchronize_sched()</tt>).  In Linux&nbsp;4.19 and earlier, the flavors
needed to be matched up.  The resulting bug was somehow used to cause a
use-after-free, leading to the exploit.
</p>

<p>
Torvalds asked if there was a way to deal with this problem; the way to do
so is to make <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt> work for all of the flavors.
McKenney said that it
took "about a year of my life to make it happen", but it solves the problem
except for one little thing: if you need to backport something to&nbsp;4.19
or earlier.
Amir Goldstein asked: "does that mean we have a booby trap now?"  McKenney
agreed that it was, but that there is a "'get out of jail free' card" with
<tt>synchronize_rcu_mult()</tt>; it can be called in those earlier kernels
and gets passed the various flavors
of <tt>call_rcu()</tt> that are being used.  It will chain calls to each of those and
wait for all of them before returning, which emulates the more recent
version of <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt> at the cost of some additional latency.
</p>

<p>
In 5.4, Joel Fernandez added lockdep support to 
<tt>list_for_each_entry_rcu()</tt> (and the <tt>hlist_*</tt> variant).
Those calls can take an optional lockdep expression, which removed the need
for more variants of those calls in the API.
</p>

<p>
Uladzislau Rezki added a
single-argument version of <tt>kvfree_rcu()</tt> (<tt>kfree_rcu()</tt> is
another name for it) in&nbsp;5.9. Previously, <tt>kvfree_rcu()</tt>
required two arguments: the object to be freed and the name of a field
within the object containing
an <tt>rcu_head</tt> structure.  Now, adding the <tt>rcu_head</tt> to the
object is optional; the name of the field is not passed in that case.
If
the object structures are small, the <tt>rcu_head</tt> may add more overhead
than is desired.  The two-argument version is still supported and, as
always, never sleeps, but the new version can sleep if the system is out of
memory.
It is a tradeoff: you can use smaller structures, but it can sleep, he said.
</p>

<p>
There are new variants of RCU that are for specialized use cases.  He
did not go into much detail, but wanted people to be aware of
RCU Tasks Rude and RCU Tasks Trace since they may appear in tracebacks.
They are mostly used for tracing of trampolines and he suggested that those
who think they should use them contact him or one of the other users before
doing so. RCU Tasks has been around since&nbsp;3.18, but Rude and Trace
were added in&nbsp;5.8 with the help of Neeraj Upadhyay.
</p>

<p>
Polling for the end of the grace period, instead of calling
<tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt> and waiting for it goes back to&nbsp;3.14.
Polling is done by getting a cookie, then eventually passing the
cookie to <tt>cond_synchronize_rcu()</tt>.  This method works, but cannot be
used in contexts where sleeping is not allowed.
In addition, getting the cookie does
not imply that the grace period has actually started, which can be
problematic in some use cases.  In&nbsp;5.12, some functions
were added to the API, <tt>start_poll_synchronize_rcu()</tt> and
<tt>poll_state_synchronize_rcu()</tt>, along with <tt>*_srcu()</tt>
variants for sleepable RCU, in order to support those use cases.  There are some caveats to
be aware of in using them, however.
</p>

<p>
A feature that is mostly of interest to the realtime and HPC communities is
the run-time callback offloading (and deoffloading) support that was added by
Frédéric Weisbecker in&nbsp;5.12.  Normally, the RCU callbacks are executed
on the CPU where they were queued, but that can interfere with the workload running
on the CPU.  So there is a way to offload those callbacks to kernel threads
(kthreads) and then assign those kthreads elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, those
assignments were done at boot time by choosing which CPUs would be used for
the callbacks and that could not be changed without rebooting.
Weisbecker added the infrastructure that allows changing those assignments
at run time; a CPU gets marked as "possibly offloaded" at boot time, then
it can be switched to offloaded and back to deoffloaded at any time.
Currently there is an internal kernel function to do so, but McKenney
thinks it will be wired up with a user-space interface at some point.
</p>

<p>
Another feature is a "memory diet" for the sleepable RCU (SRCU) code.
Previously, it would allocate an array based on <tt>NR_CPUS</tt>,
which is the maximum number of CPUs that the kernel can handle.  That
number is sometimes set to&nbsp;4096 by distributions even though the vast
majority of the systems where they run will have far fewer CPUs.  So,
instead of allocating the array at build time, it now gets allocated at run
time based on the number of CPUs actually present.  That is due in&nbsp;5.19.
</p>

<p>
Another feature slated for&nbsp;5.19 is realtime expedited grace periods
contributed by Rezki.
McKenney gave a brief history of the length of RCU CPU-stall timeouts.  In the
1990s, Dynix/PTX used&nbsp;1.5s; in the 2000s, 
Linux used&nbsp;60s, which was somewhat disappointing to him. In the 2010s
that dropped to&nbsp;21s for Linux; now a patch has proposed&nbsp;20ms.  On
Android systems, the expedited 
grace period CPU-stall timeout would be 20ms, while it would stay 21s on other systems.
</p>

<p>
In order for that to work, some additional patches from Kalesh Singh are
being added.  Normally expedited grace periods are driven by workqueues and
run with the <tt>SCHED_OTHER</tt> scheduling class, like normal user-space
processes.  The patches will add a new kind of 
expedited kthread in the <tt>SCHED_FIFO</tt> scheduling class, which is "strong
medicine", he said.  It is limited to systems with fewer than 32 CPUs, no
realtime, and with priority boosting enabled.  The test results were
impressive, he said, with latencies reduced by three orders of magnitude,
down to roughly 2ms.  It is a kind of realtime system with the expedited
grace period on the fast path;
"If you told me that last year, I would have laughed in your face."
</p>

<h4>Future</h4>

<p>
He said that he had turned&nbsp;100 this year, or perhaps&nbsp;40, but in
base&nbsp;10, of course, that's&nbsp;64.  He expects to be around for a while,
noting that his father and grandfathers worked until they were&nbsp;90 or
so, but "mother nature's retirement program" awaits us all, so it is good
to be prepared. He put up a list of some things that might be worked on in
the future, but pointed out that the things that he can't see coming
complicate that picture.  There need to be people with a good understanding of
RCU to handle those when they arise.
</p>

<p>
He looked back at the commits to RCU over a two-year period that ended in
April 2017, so five years ago.  That showed&nbsp;46 contributors, most of
whom contributed a single patch, while McKenney contributed the vast
majority of patches (288 patches or&nbsp;74%).  Looking at the previous two
years from April&nbsp;2022 shows&nbsp;79 contributors, with McKenney's percentage of the
patches committed dropping to&nbsp;63% (503 patches).  One reason that the
overall patch numbers have increased is that, since he started at Facebook,
he has concentrated on adding 
more distributed testing for RCU.
</p>

<p>
In general, the trend is going in the right direction.  There are
developers who have been doing significant work deep inside RCU recently,
which is great.  There is still a lot of work to do, however, he said.  One
thing that he has noted over the years is that once a developer shows they
can work on RCU, some company pays them a lot of money to work on something
else.  That is good, because people with some RCU knowledge are spread
around the community.  More recently he has noticed developers sticking
with RCU itself, which is even better.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge and understanding of RCU needs to be better propagated
throughout the community, he said.  He has recommended two presentations
that he did as
good starting points for that (<a
href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/webinars/unraveling-rcu-usage-mysteries/">here</a>
and <a
href="https://linuxfoundation.org/webinars/unraveling-rcu-usage-mysteries-additional-use-cases/">here</a>)
but more is needed.  There is also a more general problem of how to choose the
right synchronization tool for a given problem—RCU is not always the right
choice—which is another area that needs better understanding and
propagation within the kernel community.

      <p>"<b><i>They are mostly used for tracing of trampolines</i></b>"
<p>
For RCU tasks rude and trace, it's not about tracing of trampolines, but the use of trampolines in tracing.
<p>
The issue that RCU is trying to solve here, is that tracing uses trampolines that normal code may jump to. For instance, ftrace changes a nop at the start of a function to call a trampoline that has been dynamically allocated. Now when tracing is over, and one wants to free that trampoline, we must ensure there's nothing on that trampoline, or about to jump to that trampoline. The problem is, there's no "<code>rcu_read_lock()</code>" around the call site to the trampoline. Remember, it was originally just a nop that was converted into a call to the trampoline. That means you do not have a way to know if something is in the process of calling the trampoline just as you free it.
<p>
To solve this, we enforce that the trampoline does not voluntarily call schedule (it is fine to be preempted). That way, the quiescent state is any time a task voluntarily calls schedule (or enters user space or idle). Thus, <code>a synchronize_rcu_tasks()</code> will wait for all running tasks to call schedule, go idle (sleep, not be preempted) or enter user space.
<p>
The difference between the tasks trace and tasks rude is where these trampolines may be called from. The tracepoint trampolines are all called from locations that RCU is "watching". That is, RCU is aware of the state of the task and that it may have called a trampoline. But ftrace function tracing has some locations it is called where RCU is not "watching" and RCU might think that the task is in a quiescent state when it is not. For those cases, RCU tasks rude will basically do a "<code>schedule_on_each_cpu()</code>". That is, it will force a schedule on every CPU (horrible for RT tasks).
<p>
There's work to <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=076f14be7fc9">remove all instrumentation from these locations</a> that RCU is not watching (no ftrace callers), and when that happens, RCU tasks trace will be sufficient and the rude version will be a thing of the past.

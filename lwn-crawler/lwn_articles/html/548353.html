<a href="/Articles/LSFMM2013/">LSFMM Summit 2013</a>
</div>
<p>
Filesystem handling of errors returned from the SCSI subsystem was the
topic of the final combined session for the Storage and  
Filesystem 
tracks at the 2013 LSFMM Summit.  It is a follow-on to an <a
href="/Articles/548295/">earlier session</a> that got a little
side-tracked.  The discussion was led by Hannes Reinecke and James Bottomley.
</p>

<p>
Reinecke displayed the code from <tt>__scsi_error_from_host_byte()</tt> to
show attendees the existing errors that can be returned from the SCSI layer.
He asked Dave Chinner, who had earlier expressed interest in seeing errors
other than 
<tt>EIO</tt> be returned, how he would like to see those change.  Chinner
responded that it was more than just what the error code is; filesystem
developers needed to understand what the actual failure is.  Most
important, from his perspective, is whether it could be a temporary
failure or not. 
</p>

<p>
Chinner gave the example of a Fibre Channel link failure, which can take up
to 240 seconds to come back.  After 30 seconds, though, the filesystem has
received an <tt>EIO</tt> and has shut down.  If the Fibre Channel comes
back in a few minutes, the filesystem has done the wrong thing from the
user's perspective.  In that case, the filesystem could have tried again in
a few minutes and only shut down after getting 3-4 failures in a row.
Overall, filesystems are looking for "classes of errors" that will help the
higher levels determine whether to retry or give up, he said.

<p>
But, as Martin Petersen pointed out, the storage does not know if
the error is temporary.  Chinner noted that there are certain types, like read
failures, that are often temporary.  Alasdair Kergon was concerned about
which level should make that kind of decision.  If the kernel developers
are not careful, 
every layer and filesystem will repeat the same kind of logic to make those
decisions.  
</p>

<p>
Five or six distinct error codes, one for each class of error, is
what Chinner would like to see.  He suggested sticking to POSIX error codes
(rather than a new set established between storage and filesystem
developers) in case they end up leaking to user space.  He reiterated that
the filesystem developers don't particularly care what the error code is,
but they want to know if the error is transient.  He suggested something like
"transient read error", "permanent read error", and the same for writes,
but Petersen 
noted, again, that no one really knows if the errors are transient.
</p>

<p>
There are things a filesystem can do if it knows that there was some kind
of media error on a write, Ric Wheeler said.  The data could be written to
another disk, or written in place elsewhere on the disk.  But that can only
happen if the filesystem gets some indication other than <tt>EIO</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If the errors returned are to change, Chinner asked, what can be done to
document those changes?  Documentation in the kernel tree is fine, but
there needs to 
be more widespread notification.  In the end, it was suggested that posting
the information to the fs-devel mailing list (and also to LWN) is the right
way to go about it.  While some changes were agreed upon in the meeting,
it's not clear how and when (or even if) those exact error return values
will be used&mdash;though some changes are likely.

      Error codes are not very forward-thinking.  What would be more flexible is to return that actual facts desired.  For example, an indication of "how transient is this error?" with values saying "transient", "not transient", and "don't know".  Separately, an indication of "is the problem specific to this storage address?", etc.

How about returning SCSI ASCQ equivalent codes in parallel with POSIX error codes? File systems might be interested about SCSI layer warning messages like "WARNING - NON-VOLATILE CACHE NOW VOLATILE" or "WARNING - POWER LOSS EXPECTED".<br>

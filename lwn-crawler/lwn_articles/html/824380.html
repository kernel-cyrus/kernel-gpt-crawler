           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 25, 2020</br>

The idea of handling system calls differently depending on the origin of each
call in the process's address space is not entirely new.  OpenBSD, for
example, <a href="/Articles/806776/">disallows system calls entirely</a> if
they are not made from the system's C library as a security-enhancing
mechanism.  At the end of May, Gabriel Krisman Bertazi <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200530055953.817666-1-krisman@collabora.com/">proposed
a similar mechanism for Linux</a>, but the objective was not security at
all; instead, he is working to make Windows games run better under <a
href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>. 
That involves detecting and emulating Windows system calls; this can be
done through origin-based filtering, but that may not be the solution that
is merged in the end.
<p>
To run with any speed at all, Wine must run Windows code directly on the
CPU to the greatest extent possible.  That must end, though, once the
Windows program makes a system call; trapping into the Linux kernel with
the intent of making a Windows system call is highly unlikely to lead to
good results.  Traditionally, Wine has handled this by supplying its own
version of the user-space <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">Windows API</a> that
implemented the required functionality using Linux system calls.  As
explained in the patch posting, though, Windows applications are
increasingly executing system calls directly rather than going through the
API; that makes Wine unable to intercept them.
<p>
The good news is that Linux provides the ability to intercept system calls
in the form of <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>.
The bad news is that this mechanism, as found in current kernels, is not
suited to the task of intercepting only system calls made from Windows code
running within a larger process.  Intercepting every system call would slow
things down considerably, an effect that tends to make gamers particularly
cranky.  Tracking which parts of a process's address space make Linux
system calls and which make Windows calls within the (classic) BPF programs
used by <tt>seccomp()</tt> would be awkward at best and, once again, would
be slow.  So it seems that a new mechanism is called for.
<p>
The patch set adds a new memory-protection bit for <tt><a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap()</a></tt>
called <tt>PROT_NOSYSCALL</tt> which, by default, does not change the
kernel's behavior.  If, however, a given process has turned on the new
<tt>SECCOMP_MODE_MMAP</tt> mode in <tt>seccomp()</tt>, any system calls
made from memory regions marked with <tt>PROT_NOSYSCALL</tt> will be
trapped; the handler code can then emulate the attempted system call.
<p>
The cover letter notes that one should not rely on this mechanism the way
OpenBSD uses its origin verification:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	It goes without saying that this is in no way a security mechanism
	despite being built on top of seccomp, since an evil application
	can always jump to a whitelisted memory region and run the syscall.
	This is not a concern for Wine games.
</div>
<p>
<tt>seccomp()</tt> is used for this non-security feature, the text
continues, because the alternative would be to duplicate much of its
functionality.
<p>
The patch series generated a fair amount of discussion from developers who
were not entirely comfortable with this mechanism.  Kees Cook, for example,
<a href="/ml/linux-kernel/202005300923.B245392C@keescook/">asked</a>
whether it would instead be possible to rewrite the Windows binary code at
load time, replacing
system calls with calls to the emulation functions.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/851rn0ejg9.fsf@collabora.com/">answer</a>, it seems,
is "no".  Modifying a game's code is likely to set off checks made to
defeat cheaters, who also would otherwise make code modifications of their
own.  Wine developer Paul Gofman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/9a512096-7707-3fc6-34ba-22f969c0f964@gmail.com/">added</a>
that, to make such changes, Wine "<q>would need some
way to find those syscalls in the highly obfuscated dynamically
generated code, the whole purpose of which is to prevent disassembling,
debugging and finding things like that in it</q>".
<p>
Matthew Wilcox, instead, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200531164938.GF19604@bombadil.infradead.org/">suggested</a>
that the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/personality.2.html"><tt>personality()</tt></a>
mechanism could be extended to support a Windows personality.  This,
essentially, would create a new system-call entry point that would emulate
the Windows calls.  Gofman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/c007e3e9-e915-16f3-de31-c811ad37c44c@gmail.com/">replied</a>
that this approach had been considered, but that the cost of executing the
<tt>personality()</tt> call on each transition between Linux and Windows
code would be too high.  A possible solution here is to implement a special
personality that looks at a flag, stored in user-space memory, to determine
how system calls should be handled.  Gofman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/9c1f9db8-5680-cd1a-37aa-5f494b034825@gmail.com/">offered</a>
to create a Wine patch using such a mechanism if an implementation existed;
Krisman <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/85367e7juc.fsf@collabora.com/">said</a>
that he would give it a try.
<p>
Andy Lutomirski had a couple of other suggestions, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/079539BF-F301-47BA-AEAD-AED23275FEA1@amacapital.net/">the
first of which</a> was a 
<a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
operation that would redirect all system calls through a user-space
trampoline.  System calls from the trampoline itself would be executed
normally.  In Wine's case, that trampoline could emulate system calls from
Windows code while passing Linux system calls through to the kernel.
Krisman <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/87h7vhgzp1.fsf@collabora.com/">indicated
interest</a> in this approach, and may implement a version of this idea as
well.
<p>
Lutomirski's <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CALCETrWr_B-quNckFksTP1W-Ww71uQgCrR-o9QWdQ-Gi8p1r9A@mail.gmail.com/">other
idea</a> was to allow a process to establish an (extended) BPF filter
program for all system calls; he later <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CALCETrW9R7YyxkervbsH2NZDUtYzag23ewD=--poeH54nc-yiQ@mail.gmail.com/">extended</a>
this idea to have it handle all "<q>architectural privilege
transitions</q>" for the process.  This approach offers a lot of
flexibility and may be useful far beyond Wine, but it suffers from a
significant flaw: in the absence of unprivileged BPF, it could only be
invoked by a privileged process, which is a show-stopper for Wine.  Unless
something changes, unprivileged BPF is <a href="/Articles/796328/">an idea
that isn't going anywhere</a> in Linux, so the filter program does not look
like a solution that Wine could use.
<p>
The end result of this discussion is that the problem is reasonably well
understood and there is a shared desire to solve it.  What form that
solution will take is far from clear, though; there are a few approaches
that need to be experimented with.  Expect to see more patches in the
future as the developers work to find which idea works best.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I was all set to dislike this proposal, but I actually think the original idea is great, and is kind of underselling itself.<br>
<p>
The PROT_NOSYSCALL could be turned into a remarkably elegant and effective security barrier when combined with Intel&#x27;s Indirect Branch Tracking (part of CET) to remove the possibility of jumping directly to a SYSCALL instruction.<br>

To clarify the kind of design I&#x27;m thinking of, you could perhaps get something more flexible than a BPF syscall filter by making all executable pages PROT_NOSYSCALL, requiring all syscalls to go via a single non-PROT_NOSYSCALL page which performs the filtering in userspace and then performs the syscall. Assuming CET is turned on, as it&#x27;s needed to ensure the filtering is done before the syscall instruction.<br>
<p>
Obviously there are still a lot of potential problems when you have security code running in the same address space as the code it&#x27;s defending against, so there might be something I&#x27;m missing. Certainly the trusted code that does the filtering would have to be very carefully written to defend against the program altering the filter code, and there are lots of potential race conditions if you&#x27;d want to check anything stored in memory.<br>
<p>
Still, it seems like a pretty flexible approach, especially considering syscall filtering via bpf is also pretty limited, and worth thinking about?<br>

I think the user-space trampoline is the most promising solution here: it requires extremely minimal code changes to the kernel and offers full flexibility to the user-space programs, because they can use any code they want for their trampoline, and that code can be extremely hand-optimized assembly for that specific use case.<br>
<p>
And if somebody much more clever than me when it comes to assembly can figure out a way to do that without requiring a context switch for the instruction that triggers the trampoline (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible) then this would have the same performance as eBPF, because whether you do the comparison in ring 3 or ring 0 shouldn&#x27;t actually change anything.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if you do need two additional context switches (one for entering the kernel and one for jumping back to the trampoline) then one would have to measure the performance impact here. (Though in that case one optimization could be for the kernel to postpone the speculative execution mitigations until after it has determined the syscall comes from the trampoline and should hence be used directly, and don&#x27;t do any of the mitigations both for entering and exiting ring 0 if it wants to jump immediately back to the trampoline, that should reduce the cost of the context switches quite a bit.)<br>

rr grapples with a similar problem. We need to intercept commonly-executed system calls and wrap them with our own processing, with minimal overhead. I think Wine could probably use our approach.<br>
<p>
We use a seccomp filter to trap on all syscalls except for those called from a single specific trampoline page. When a library makes a syscall, the filter triggers a ptrace trap. The ptracer looks at the code around the syscall and if it matches certain common patterns, we patch it with a jump to a stub that does the extra work we need and then issues a real syscall via the trampoline. Thus, a library syscall is slow the first time and fast the rest of the time. (Another possible variant of this approach, probably faster when applicable, would be to avoid using a ptracer and have the filter trigger a SIGSYS whose handler does the patching.)<br>

Maybe I should post this to the list...<br>

As mentioned in the article, patching Windows game code is unlikely to work well, because in some cases it tries to detect external modifications to itself as an anti-cheating mechanism, and it&#x27;s deliberately obfuscated to make modification and tracing harder. I&#x27;m aware rr isn&#x27;t usually tracing actively cooperating processes, but it isn&#x27;t usually tracing a process that is actively uncooperative either.<br>

The rr approach applied to Wine would not require patching the Windows game code, only the Wine/Linux libraries which *are* somewhat cooperative.<br>
<p>
Discussing it on LKML, the problem with our approach for Wine is probably the issues with multiple threads potentially racing with system-call patching.<br>

The patchset says it&#x27;s addressing the way that &quot;Modern Windows applications are executing system call instructions directly from the application&#x27;s code without going through the WinAPI&quot; -- so I think your approach would imply patching game code. It sounds like they already have workable approaches for apps that are traditional &quot;call the winapi library which makes the syscall&quot; style.<br>

No, you would:<br>
<p>
* patch WINE libraries (the only ones that should issue Linux system calls) to go through a trampoline page<br>
<p>
* use seccomp-bpf to raise SIGSYS for almost all code except that single trampoline page<br>
<p>
* now if you get SIGSYS you now it&#x27;s a Windows syscall, and you handle it from the SIGSYS handler<br>

That would work, but it&#x27;s not the approach suggested at the top of this comment thread, which includes &quot;The ptracer looks at the code around the syscall and if it matches certain common patterns, we patch it with a jump to a stub&quot;...

Wine uses glibc and a bunch of other system libraries which do need to be patched. Those libraries aren&#x27;t trying to stop us patching them, but they&#x27;re not providing any hooks to avoid the need for patching, either.<br>
<p>
Again: you don&#x27;t need to patch the tricky game code with this approach ... as long as you can tolerate those syscalls being slow.<br>

I imagine this will depend on the game. If it&#x27;s isolated into a bunch of small levels with loading screens between them, well, the loading screens will suck, but the rest of the game should basically work most of the time, assuming the game engine isn&#x27;t trying to do something weird (like constantly telling the OS which pages to evict first).<br>
<p>
But if it&#x27;s an open world game that dynamically loads stuff in and out of memory all the time, then you&#x27;re in trouble.<br>

IIRC from when I read the thread, they are OK with overhead on syscalls from windows code, they are not the concern for performance, they are concerned that applying some sort of overhead for all syscalls is a bigger performance hit because the linux libraries and the winAPI emulation code.<br>

You can&#x27;t achieve anything here by patching WINE libs because as the prev. author<br>
said, there&#x27;s no problem with apps that go through them. The problem being<br>
discussed is that some apps make system calls without going through WinAPI/WINE<br>
libs. Let me quote the original mail:<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; from the application&#x27;s code without going through the WinAPI.  This breaks Wine</font><br>

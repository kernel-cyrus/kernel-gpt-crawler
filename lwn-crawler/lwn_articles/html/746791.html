At <a href="/Articles/747069/">the close of the 4.16 merge window</a>,
11,746
non-merge changesets had been merged; that is 5,000 since <a
href="/Articles/746129/">last week's summary</a>.  This merge window is
thus a busy one, though not out of line with its predecessors — 4.14 had
11,500 changesets during its merge window, while 4.15 had 12,599.  Quite a
bit of that work is of the boring internal variety; over 600 of those
changesets were
device-tree updates, for example.  But there was still a fair amount of
interesting work merged in the second half of the 4.16 merge window; read
on for the highlights.
<br clear="all">
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The PowerPC architecture now has support for <a
     href="/Articles/689395/">memory-protection keys</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/728795/">expedited option</a> has been added to
     the <a
     href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/membarrier.2.html"><tt>membarrier()</tt></a>
     system call.  The API has changed somewhat since it was last
     discussed, though.  At that time, there was a concern about not
     perturbing processes that did not need to participate in any given
     barrier operation, and some complex schemes for figuring out which
     processes to include.  The merged patches, though, create an opt-in
     mechanism for processes that want to participate in "global" barrier
     operations.

     Opting in is a matter of calling <tt>membarrier()</tt> with the
     concise and easy-to-type
     <tt>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</tt> command.  An
     expedited barrier can be sent to all registered processes with
     <tt>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</tt>. 

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Overlay filesystems using overlayfs can now be exported via NFS.
     Enabling this functionality changes some overlayfs behavior and can
     create a filesystem that is not backward compatible; see the
     documentation in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f168f1098dd9038daaf9f7be5f81cdea4985886a">this
     commit</a> and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a01f64b5c06ca1130b0b72ceb5e2a25e4d37ab08">this
     commit</a> for details.
<li> The XFS reverse-mapping feature is no longer marked as being
     experimental.
<li> The AFS filesystem has "dynamic root" support; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4d673da14533b32fe8d3125b5b7be4fea14e39a8">this
     commit</a> for more information.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new <tt>console_msg_format</tt> command-line option can be used
     to adjust the formatting of <tt>printk()</tt> output.  In particular,
     setting it to <tt>syslog</tt> will cause a syslog-like format to be
     generated.
<li> Virtualization with KVM now supports AMD's <a
     href="/Articles/699820/">secure encrypted 
     virtualization (SEV)</a> feature.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a href="/Articles/727322/">usercopy whitelisting</a> patch set
     has been merged.  This mechanism further reduces the ranges of memory
     that can be copied to or from user space; now specific fields of a
     slab-allocated structure can be whitelisted.  After some discussion,
     the current configuration will only issue a warning (rather than
     oopsing the system) if non-whitelisted
     memory is copied; the intent is to find and fix any problems without
     actually breaking the kernel when those problems occur.  When
     the developers are confident that all of the issues have been found,
     that behavior may change in a more unforgiving direction.
     <p>
     Anybody wanting stricter behavior now can disable the
     <tt>HARDENED_USERCOPY_FALLBACK</tt> configuration option or set the
     <tt>slab_common.usercopy_fallback</tt> command-line option to zero.
<li> Initial mitigations for Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check bypass) have
     been merged; see <a href="/Articles/746551/">this article</a> for
     details.  The core of this support is a new
     <tt>array_index_nospec()</tt> macro that prevents speculation that
     might cause a bounds check to be circumvented.
<li> The arm64 architecture has gained another set of Meltdown/Spectre
     mitigations.  The
     <tt>array_index_nospec()</tt> operator is supported natively, and it
     has been applied in a few places in the kernel.  Branch-predictor
     hardening has been improved as well.
<li> S390 has also gained an implementation of
     <tt>array_index_nospec()</tt>, support for some new instructions to
     control branch prediction, and a variant on the retpoline concept
     called an "expoline".

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>Clock</b>:
     Hisilicon Hi3660 stub clocks,
     Spreadtrum SC9860 clocks,
     Qualcomm MSM8916 APCS clock controllers,
     AmLogic A113D clock controllers, and
     Freescale MXC realtime clocks.
<li> <b>Pin control</b>
     Meson AXG pin-control units,
     STMicroelectronics STM32MP157 and STM32F769 pin controllers,
     MediaTek MT7622 pin control units,
     Microsemi Ocelot pin control units, and
     Qualcomm MSM8998 pin controllers.
<li> <b>Media</b>:
     NXP TDA18250 silicon tuners,
     NVIDIA Tegra video decoder engines,
     Intel IPU3 CIO2 CSI-2 receivers, and
     OmniVision OV7740 sensors.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     Ilitek ILI9225 and ILI9322 display panels,
     OpenCAPI coherent accelerators,
     Cadence PCIe host controllers,
     Realtek RTD119x/RTD129x watchdog timers, and
     Spreadtrum watchdog timers.
<li> The old-style LIRC infrared controller drivers, having languished in
     staging for the requisite number of cycles, have now been removed from
     the kernel.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The way that <tt>printk()</tt> handles large amounts of message
     traffic <a href="/Articles/737822/">has been changed</a>.  It will now
     spread the work over multiple CPUs, reducing the possibility of
     locking up a CPU with constant message traffic.
<li> The i2c-gpio fault injector can be used to create "unusual states" on
     the I2C bus to test the other side's error handling; see <a
     href="/Articles/746798/">Documentation/i2c/gpio-fault-injection</a>
     for details.
</ul>
<p>

Barring a Meltdown-style security issue or some other problem of that
magnitude, the final 4.16 release can be expected in early April.  As
always, though, there is a lot of testing and fixing to be done between now
and then.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I'd like to plug a couple of improvements I made to the IDR API here:

<ul>
<li> Better support for numbering schemes that don't start at 0. If you declare/initialise your IDR with DECLARE_IDR_BASE(name, base); or idr_init_base(&amp;idr, base); then you'll get a performance improvement (and a miniscule memory improvement).
<li> Support for writing the object ID to the object before inserting it into the IDR.  If you use the IDR with lockless lookups, you currently have to cope with finding an object that doesn't know what ID it has.  The new idr_alloc_u32() function ensures the ID is initialised before the pointer is stored in the array (and, yes, it has the appropriate memory barriers).
</ul>

That is a great question!  Thank you for asking it!  I should not have assumed that my audience here would know what it is.<br>
<p>
IDR is an ID allocator.  It's been around for over 15 years, but people keep insisting on writing their own ID allocators, not realising that largely they're not better than using the one we already have.  I've been making some improvements to it over the past couple of years, mostly spurred by my interest in the radix tree.<br>
<p>
Its API can be found here:<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The XFS reverse-mapping feature is no longer marked as being experimental.</font><br>
<p>
I'm curious about the ramifications of this. Is this the one that allows snapshots and deduplication in XFS? Does that mean that these features are new stable?<br>

From the 4.8 announcement:<br>
<p>
“This reverse mapping infrastructure is the building block of several upcoming features - reflink, copy-on-write data, dedupe, online metadata and data scrubbing, highly accurate bad sector/data loss reporting to users, and significantly improved reconstruction of damaged and corrupted filesystems. There's a lot of new stuff coming along in the next couple of cycles, and it all builds in the rmap infrastructure. ”<br>
<p>
I don't know if snapshots and deduplication is marked as stable yet, but I believe online fsck (well, scrub) is now no longer experimental.<br>

It is experimental, and largely incomplete. The xfs_scrub utility is still more or less alpha and should land as a check-only tool (no repair capability) in xfsprogs 4.15.0.<br>

Reflinks were marked not-experimental right before rmap, so deduplication is not experimental any more (but you'll need to re-mkfs to use it if your filesystem was not mkfsed with the appropriate options).<br>
<p>
XFS doesn't have in-fs snapshot support yet, not even experimentally.<br>

Depends how willing you are to break into Dave Chinner's hard drive and steal his code ...<br>

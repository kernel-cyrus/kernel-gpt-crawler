           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 31, 2012</br>
           </div>
The read-copy-update (RCU) subsystem is one of the kernel's key scalability
mechanisms; it is usually invoked in situations where normal locking is far
too slow.  RCU is known to be complex code, to the point that <a
href="/Articles/456240/">lesser kernel developers</a> will happily proclaim
that they do not understand it.  That should not be taken to mean that RCU
cannot be made faster or more complex, though.  Paul McKenney's
"callback-free CPUs" patch set is a case in point.
<p>
Much RCU processing has traditionally been done in software interrupt
(softirq) context, meaning that the actual processing is done at seemingly
random times during the execution of whatever process happens to have the
CPU at the time.  Softirqs thus have the potential to add arbitrary delays
to the execution of any process, regardless of that process's priority.  It
is not surprising that the realtime developers <a
href="/Articles/520076/">have been working</a> on the softirq problem;
non-realtime developers, too, have been known to grumble about softirq
overhead.  Depending on the load on the system, RCU processing can be a
significant part of the overall softirq workload.  So improvements in RCU
processing can help eliminate unwanted latencies and jitter even if
software interrupt handling as a whole remains unchanged.
<p>
Paul recently <a href="/Articles/518953/">described some work in that
direction</a> on this page; as of the 3.6 kernel, much of the RCU grace
period handling has been moved to kernel threads.  RCU works by replacing
a data structure with a modified version, retaining the old copy but hiding
it from view so that no new references to it will be created.  The
RCU rules guarantee that any data structure made inaccessible in this way
before a 
"grace period" passes will have no outstanding references after that
period; the determination of grace periods is thus a crucial step in the
cleanup and deletion of those old data structures.  It turns out that
identifying grace periods in a scalable and efficient manner is not a
trivial task; see, for example, <a href="/Articles/305782/">this
article</a> for details.  
<p>
Moving grace period handling to kernel threads takes a certain amount of
RCU overhead out of the softirq path, reducing jitter and allowing that
handling to be assigned priorities like any other process.  But, even with
grace period processing out of the way, RCU still has a fair amount of work
to do in softirq context.  Near the top of the list is the calling of RCU
callbacks â€” the functions that actually perform cleanup work after a grace
period passes.  With some workloads, the number of callbacks can get quite
large.  Users concerned about jitter have expressed a desire to move as
much kernel processing out of the way as possible; RCU callback
processing represents a significant chunk of that work.
<p>
That is the motivation for Paul's <a href="/Articles/522145/">callback-free
CPUs patch set</a>.  The idea is simple enough: rather than invoke RCU
callbacks in softirq context, the kernel can just shunt that work off to
yet another kernel thread.  The implementation, of course, is just a bit
more involved than that.
<p>
The patch set adds a new <tt>rcu_nocbs=</tt> boot-time parameter allowing
the system administrator to specify a set of CPUs to run in the "no
callbacks" mode.  It is not possible to do so with every CPU in the system;
at least one processor must remain in the traditional mode or grace period
processing will not function properly.  In practical terms, that means that
CPU0 cannot be run in the no-callbacks mode and any attempt to hot-remove
the last traditional-RCU CPU will fail.
<p>
When a CPU (call it <tt>CPU<i>N</i></tt>) runs without RCU callbacks, there
will be a separate 
<tt>rcuo<i>N</i></tt> process charged with callback handling.  When that
process 
wakes up, it will grab the list of outstanding callbacks for its assigned
CPU, using some tricky atomic-exchange techniques to avoid the need for
explicit locking.  The thread will wait for the grace period to expire,
then run through the callbacks; after that the cycle begins anew.  Normally
the process wakes up when callbacks are added to an empty list, but a
separate boot parameter instructs the threads to poll occasionally for new
work instead.  Polling has its costs, especially on systems where energy
efficiency and letting CPUs sleep are priorities, but it can improve RCU's
CPU efficiency, helping throughput.
<p>
Users who are so sensitive to jitter that they want to reconfigure RCU
callback processing may not be satisfied just by having that processing
move to a thread that competes with their workload.  The good news for
those users is that, once callback processing lives in its own thread, it
can be assigned a priority that fits with the overall goals of the system.
Perhaps even better, the callback thread does not have to run on the CPU
whose callbacks it is handling; by playing with CPU affinities,
administrators can move that work to other CPUs, freeing the no-callback
CPUs to focus more exclusively on the user's workload.
<p>
No-callback CPUs are thus part of the larger effort toward fully-dedicated
CPUs that run nothing but the user's processes.  The idea is that, on such
a CPU, the workload would be fully in charge and need never worry that the
kernel would get in the way when there is time-sensitive work to be done.
Solving that problem in a robust and maintainable manner is a rather larger
problem; it requires the <a href="/Articles/420544/">NoHZ mechanism</a> and
more.  It has been recognized for some time that this problem will need to
be solved in smaller pieces; the no-callback CPUs patch is one of those
pieces.
<p>
This patch set is in its second iteration; comments this time around have
been scarce.  Barring surprises, it would not be surprising to see this
feature pushed into the 3.8 kernel.  Most users will not care, but, for
those who obsess about latency and jitter, it should be a welcome addition.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

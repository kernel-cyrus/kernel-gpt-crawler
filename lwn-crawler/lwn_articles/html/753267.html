<h1>Reworking page-table traversal</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 4, 2018</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2018/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
A system's page tables are organized into a tree that is as many as five
levels deep.  In many ways those levels are all similar, but the kernel
treats them all as being different, with the result that page-table
manipulations include a fair amount of repetitive code.  During the
memory-management track of the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit, Kirill Shutemov proposed reworking how page
tables are maintained.  The idea was popular, but the implementation is
likely to be tricky.
<p>
On a system with five-level page tables (which few of us have at this
point, since Shutemov just added the fifth level), a traversal of the tree
starts at the page global directory (PGD).  From there, it proceeds to the
P4D, the page upper directory (PUD), the page middle directory (PMD), and
finally to the PTE level that contains information about individual 4KB
pages.  If the kernel wants to unmap a range of page-table entries, it may
have to make changes at multiple levels.  In the code, that means that a
call to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memory.c#L1496"><tt>unmap_page_range()</tt></a>
will start in the PGD, then call <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memory.c#L1477"><tt>zap_p4d_range()</tt></a>

<a href="/Articles/753268/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2018/lsfmm/KirillShutemov2-sm.jpg" alt="[Kirill
Shutemov]" title="Kirill Shutemov" class="rthumb"></a>

to do the work at the P4D level.  The calls trickle down through <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memory.c#L1448"><tt>zap_pud_range()</tt></a>
and <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memory.c#L1411"><tt>zap_pmd_range()</tt></a>
before ending up in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memory.c#L1281"><tt>zap_pte_range()</tt></a>.
All of the levels in this traversal (except the final one) look quite
similar, but each is coded separately.  There is a similar cascade of
functions for most common page-table operations.  Some clever coding
ensures that the unneeded layers are compiled out when the kernel is built
for a system with shallower page tables.
<p>
Shutemov would like to replace this boilerplate with something a bit more
compact.  He is proposing representing a pointer into the page tables (at
any level) with a structure like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct pt_ptr {
        unsigned long *ptr;
	int lvl;
    };
</pre>
<p><blockquote class="ad">
<b><tt>$ sudo subscribe today</tt></b>

</blockquote>
<p>
Using this structure, page-table manipulations would be handled by a single
function that would call itself recursively to work down the levels.
Recursion is generally frowned upon in the kernel because it can eat up
stack space, but in this case it is strictly bounded by the depth of the
page tables.  That one function would replace the five that exist now, but
it would naturally become somewhat more complex.
<p>
He asked: would this change be worth it?  Michal Hocko asked just how many
years of work would be required to get this change done.  Among other
things, it would have to touch every architecture in the system.  If it
proves impossible to create some sort of a compatibility layer that would
let architectures opt into the new scheme, an all-architecture flag day
would be required.  Given that, Hocko said that he wasn't sure it would be
worth the trouble.
<p>
Laura Abbott asked what problems would be solved by the new mechanism.  One
is that it would deal more gracefully with pages of different sizes.  Some
architectures (POWER, for example) can support multiple page sizes
simultaneously; this scheme would make that feature easier to use and
manage.  Current code has to deal with a number of special cases involving
the top-level table; those would mostly go away in the new scheme.  And,
presumably, the resulting code would be cleaner.
<p>
It was also said in jest that this mechanism would simplify the work when
processors using six-level page tables show up.  The subsequent discussion
suggested that this is no joking matter; it seems that such designs are
already under consideration.  When such hardware does appear, Shutemov
said, there will be no time to radically rework page-table manipulations to
support it, so there will be no alternative to adding a sixth layer of
functions instead.  In an effort to avoid that, he is going to
try to push this work forward on the x86 architecture and see how it goes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

If x86 were willing to switch to an 8k page size, 5 level paging would get them 63 bits.<br>

Yes we have 5. The tricky thing is that the format of the page tables differ. So a PMD entry has a different format than a PTE. Not sure if the proposed scheme would be better for such things were we have to use different accessors depending on the level.<br>

There’s no need for an 8k page. All that would be needed is bigger page table chunks.  8k (i.e. two-page) directories with 8-byte entries gives 10 bits of VA per level. 12+5*10 = 62 bits. Now give separate roots for the top and bottom halves of the address space and 63 of the 64 possible bits are covered.<br>
<p>
Intel, if you ever revamp the page table format again, here are some feature requests:<br>
<p>
 - Separate R, W, and X bits.<br>
<p>
 - Separate page table roots for the top and bottom halves of the address space. Or, even better, separate user-mode and kernel-mode page tables.<br>
<p>
 - At least one extra address space accessible with prefixes or special instructions. For example, having the stack live in a separate address space accessible only with PUSH, POP, and prefixed memory operands would be awesome.<br>
<p>
(Hmm. There are already mostly-useless CS, SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS prefixes. Make each one refer to a separate address space. Make ES, FS, and GS be usable only at CPL0, and make CPL0 default to the ES space and CPL &gt; 0 default to CS.)<br>

8-byte entries is not enough. We already run out of bits in the entries and every new feature wants to claim one (or 15 with MKTME :P).<br>
<p>
Why is separate roots from kernel/user useful? Is it only to protect against Meltdown-alike stuff?<br>

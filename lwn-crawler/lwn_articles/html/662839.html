<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2015/">2015 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
Kernel developers, and subsystem maintainers in particular, are in a
trusted position: they are able to direct code into the mainline kernel.
They are thus a potential target for anybody who would like to get a
malicious change into a kernel used by countless people.  How can those
developers keep their workflow secure?  At the 2015 Kernel Summit, a panel
consisting of James Bottomley, Kees Cook, James Morris, Konstantin
Ryabitsev, Josh Triplett, and Ted Ts'o talked about personal approaches to
workflow security and what other developers should be doing.
<p>
Ted started by saying that he is not, in general, worried about attackers
trying to steal things from his laptop.  He is worried about attempts to
steal keys, though, so those are stored on a YubiKey rather than the
laptop.  He tried SELinux for a while, but found it to be too painful for
the amount of security gained.  With regard to the patches he handles, he
said that the ext4 filesystem doesn't get a huge volume of patches, so he
is able to look them over closely before sending them on.
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>

Josh, instead, worries about what will happen if his laptop is stolen.  So
he uses full-disk encryption and, as a rule, shuts the system down hard
rather than suspending it.  For the most part, though, he does not expect
to be targeted personally, so he mostly worries about defending himself
from mass attacks.  If you download a tarball, configure, and build it, are
you doing that in an isolated environment?
<p>
Konstantin started by noting that he has root access to kernel.org, so he
sometimes sleeps poorly at night.  He feels that he probably <i>is</i> a target,
and that he needs to be careful to prevent a compromise of the kernel.org
infrastructure.  To that end, he and his team have been working on <a
href="https://github.com/lfit/itpol">a set of security policies</a> that
have been made available on GitHub.
<p>
James Morris stated briefly that any developer should feel like they could
be target; they are developing software for billions of machines, after
all.  One special measure he takes is to ensure that his cellphone is not
connected to his work in any way.
<p>
Kees takes care to ensure that his laptop only authenticates outwardly; it
does not accept any kind of incoming connection.  He does builds in
containers to keep them isolated.  His only browser is Chrome, due to the
way it uses containment for many of its operations.  And he tries to get
others to look at patches before accepting them.
<p>
James Bottomley said that his process was mostly about "key hygiene."  He
uses subkeys with short expiration times; his working systems have no
access to his main keys.  With regard to code acceptance in the SCSI tree,
he used to review all patches, but now trusts reviews from certain other
developers as well.
<p>
Linus jumped in to ask how many developers in the room were carrying their
main work machines with them; quite a few were.  How many were using disk

<a href="/Articles/662842/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2015/klf-ks/LinusTorvalds-sp-sm.jpg" width=250 height=312

align="right"></a> 

encryption?  Those who aren't might want to look into doing so.
Does anybody have the SSH daemon running?  "Don't do that" was
his advice there.
<p>
Most of the rest of this session was spent discussing the GPG keys used to
sign tags in Git repositories.  Somebody noted that a pull request had been
accepted, even though it had been signed by a revoked key.  Linus answered
that key revocation does not always work as well as one might hope, and
that revoked keys will often be validated by GPG.  Beyond that, he carries
his own keyring; a revocation may not be present there.  If you revoke a
key, he said, scream loudly so that he knows about it.
Linus also said that James's use of subkeys was not necessarily helpful.
It is, he said, a case of trusting the tool rather than trusting the
person.
<p>
Finally, there was a brief discussion about accepting pull requests.  Some
maintainers will pull directly from another developer's repository, while
others want to see patches on a public list.  It comes down to a matter of
trust; don't pull from a developer you don't trust.  And, in the end, as
Josh noted, somebody has to be reading and reviewing every patch.  If
patches are being pulled directly into a repository, the person doing the
pulling has to be confident that this review has already taken place.
<p>
The session ended without any general conclusions regarding safe developer
workflow.  One suspects this is a topic that will come around again in the
future.  A lot depends on the security of a large number of developer
laptops and repositories; simply hoping that all of those developers will
follow best security practices seems like a path to trouble.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

 What is the concern with having the SSH daemon running on a notebook? <br>

If it is brute force attempts, is that mitigated with fail2ban, sshguard, etc.?<br>

It's a general recommendation not to run network-listening daemons on your workstation just in case there is a zero-day in one of them that would give an attacker access to the system. It's a sound recommendation, but should be used as part of a comprehensive workstation hardening policy to be meaningful.<br>

If you're on Fedora, using "supermin" to subset the packages you have currently installed into a tarball and then importing that into a container with machinectl is pretty easy. You could build a prototype image and import it fresh for each build. Well at least in theory; I haven't done it yet, but it seemed possible from other avenues I had been investigating.<br>

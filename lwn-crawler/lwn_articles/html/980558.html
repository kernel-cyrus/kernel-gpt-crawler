There are a number of kernel filesystems that store their directory entries
directly in the directory-entry cache (dcache) without having any permanent
storage for those objects. It started out as a "neat hack" for <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.html">ramfs</a>,
Al Viro said, at the start of his filesystem-track session at the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  Unfortunately, as the
use of this technique has grown into other filesystems, there has been a
lot of scope creep that has gotten out of control.  He wanted to discuss
some new infrastructure that he is working on to try to clean some of that
up.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/981165/">

alt="[Al Viro]" title="Al Viro" width=210 height=270>
</a>

<p>
Viro displayed some <a
href="https://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/notes">notes</a> on his
thoughts to 
accompany his talk; some of this article derives from those notes.  He has
a patch set to implement those ideas (contained in his <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs.git/log/?h=untested.persistency">"untested.persistency"
branch</a>) that is 
"very much a work in progress", which is untested and may not compile on
anything other than x86, he said.  He wanted to describe the problem it is
meant to solve and how it does so.
</p>

<p>
It all started with a demonstration by Linus Torvalds of how to create a
filesystem without a backing store, he said.  The technique kept all of the
files and 
directories in the cache and was the basis for ramfs.  A "controlled dentry
[directory entry] leak" was used; reference counts are artificially
increased to ensure that the directory entries do not get evicted.  When an unmount
is done, they are all cleaned up.
</p>

<p>
The technique was adopted by tmpfs, hugetlbfs, and in other places, because
it is simpler than what procfs uses.  There are problems that arise in some of
the
other users, however, that do not exist in the original.  The original
intent was only for filesystems that were being populated from user space,
but eventually it was used for filesystems that are populated by the
kernel, or, perhaps worse, both the kernel and user space.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
For example, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rmdir.2.html"><tt>rmdir()</tt></a>
only removes directories that are empty, but the configfs user-space tools
expect the system call
to be able to remove a populated subtree if all of its entries were created
by the kernel.  If there are
user-created 
subdirectories, the tools expect the <tt>rmdir()</tt> to fail.
Christian Brauner pointed out that the control-group filesystem (cgroupfs)
also has this behavior.  Viro said that filesystems of this sort have to
implement their own <tt>rmdir()</tt> because it is so specialized.
For configfs, it needs to check if
there have been any directories created by the user inside the targetâ€”or
any that are in progress.  The code "is horrible", he said.
</p>

<p>
There is a real need for some infrastructure to help these filesystems,
Viro said.  There are around a dozen different implementations of the
subdirectory-removal handling, none of which have been done correctly. His idea is to introduce a flag, <tt>DCACHE_PERSISTENT</tt>
that will be used to mark the dentries that are being "controllably leaked"
so that they can be properly handled.  Then the kernel-initiated operations
and those from user space can set the flag, so that they are handled in the
same way, which is not the case right now.
</p>

<p>
There would be two new functions that would be the counterparts to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.8/source/include/linux/dcache.h#L312"><tt>dget()</tt></a>
and <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.8/source/fs/dcache.c#L824"><tt>dput()</tt></a>
(which obtain and release references to directory entries); <tt>d_make_persistent()</tt>
would do the equivalent of <tt>dget()</tt> and set the flag, while
<tt>d_make_discardable()</tt> will do a <tt>dput()</tt> and clear it.
There are new helper functions to handle both the simple filesystems like ramfs
and the more complicated varieties, including handling some of the
variations of
open-coded directory-removal code.  There are more details in the notes file.
</p>

<p>
There are still four filesystems that
remain to be converted, Viro said.  They all have "interesting problems"
that need to be resolved; two of them are for <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/driver-api/usb/gadget.html">USB gadgets</a>, one is configfs,
and the other is apparmorfs.  The diffstat of his patch set shows that the changes would
actually result in a net removal of around 500&nbsp;lines of code from the tree.
</p>

<p>
He had hoped to discuss configfs
with Christoph Hellwig, who was not present, though he did arrive later in
the day.  He plans to talk to Greg Kroah-Hartman about the USB-gadget
filesystems, but is not sure who to talk to about apparmorfs.  There is
some strange locking being done in apparmorfs, which he mentioned to the AppArmor
developers, but got nowhere, he said.  There was some further discussion on
this and related work as time ran out on the session.

Did anyone find the link to the video?<br>

There seems to be a lot of videos in the Linux foundation yt Channel, but I can find it. If anyone finds it, please share. I'll search again in a few days :)<br>

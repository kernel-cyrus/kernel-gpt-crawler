           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 26, 2018</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/612153/">kernel address sanitizer</a> (KASAN) is a
kernel debugging tool meant to catch incorrect use of kernel pointers.  It
is an effective tool, if the number of KASAN-based bug reports showing up
on the mailing lists is any indication.  The downside of KASAN is a
significant increase in the amount of memory used by a running system.  The
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1537542735.git.andreyknvl@google.com/">software-tag-based
mode</a> proposed by Andrey Konovalov has the potential to address that
problem, but it brings some limitations of its own.
<p>
KASAN works by allocating a shadow memory map to describe the
addressability of the kernel's virtual address space.  Each byte in the
shadow map corresponds to eight bytes of address space and indicates how
many of those eight bytes (if any) are currently accessible to the kernel.
When the kernel allocates or frees a range of memory, the shadow map is
updated accordingly.  Using some instrumentation inserted by the compiler, KASAN
checks each kernel pointer dereference against the shadow map to ensure
that the kernel is meant to be accessing the pointed-to memory.  If the
shadow map indicates a problem, an error is raised.
<p>
It is an effective technique and, thanks to the support from the compiler,
the run-time CPU overhead is tolerable in many settings.  But the shadow
map requires a great deal of memory, and that does affect the usability of
KASAN in the real world, especially when it is used on memory-constrained
systems.  This overhead is particularly painful for users who would like to
run KASAN on production systems as an additional security measure.

<p>
The new mode uses a different approach that takes advantage of an
ARM64 feature called <a
href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.den0024a/ch12s05s01.html">top-byte
ignore</a> (TBI).  A 64-bit pointer allows for a large address space, rather
larger than is actually needed on current systems, even if a web browser is
running.  When TBI is enabled, the system's memory-management unit will
ignore the top byte of any address, allowing that byte to be used to store
eight bits of arbitrary information.  One possible use for that byte is to
ensure that pointers into memory are pointing where they were intended to.
<p>
In the software-tag-based mode, KASAN still allocates the memory map, but
with some changes.  Each byte in the map now corresponds to 16&nbsp;bytes
of real memory rather than eight, cutting the size of the map in half.
Whenever the kernel allocates memory, a random, eight-bit tag value will be
chosen.  The pointer to the allocated object (which is aligned to a 16-byte
boundary) will have that tag value set in the top byte; the tag value is
also stored into the shadow memory map at the location(s) corresponding to
that object.  Whenever the returned pointer is dereferenced, its embedded
tag value will be compared (using instrumentation from the compiler again)
against the tag stored in the shadow memory map; 
if they do not match, an error will be logged.
<p>
There are some clear advantages to this mode, starting with the halving of
the amount of memory required for the shadow map.  Current KASAN can only
catch references to memory that the kernel is not meant to access at all;
the new mode can catch the use of pointers that have strayed into the wrong
part of kernel memory.  On the other hand, the new mode will fail to catch
a reference just beyond an allocated object if it falls within the 16-byte
resolution of the map.  There is a small possibility that an errant pointer
will hit another region of memory that happened to get the same tag; such
an access would not be detected.  This
mode will also only work on ARM64 processors, and it requires at least
version&nbsp;7 of the Clang compiler.
<p>
There is another potential issue with the use of the
software-tag-based mode.  Address translation will ignore the top byte of a
pointer when TBI is turned on, but other operations, such as pointer
arithmetic and pointer comparisons, will not.  Subtracting one pointer from
another is a common operation in C programs; if those two pointers have
different tag values, though, the result is unlikely to be what the
developer intended.  An erroneous subtraction is likely to make itself
known quickly, but a comparison for equality that fails because two
otherwise equal pointers have different tags could lead to rather more
subtle problems.  One can argue that pointers with different tags will have
originated from different allocations and should not be compared anyway,
but <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180628105057.GA26019@e103592.cambridge.arm.com/">worries</a>
about the possibility of breaking things have led to some long discussions
after previous postings of this work.
<p>
In an attempt to address these concerns, Konovalov ran some extensive tests
to try to find potential problems:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	All pointer comparisons/subtractions have been instrumented in an
	LLVM compiler pass and a kernel module that would print a bug
	report whenever two pointers with different tags are being
	compared/subtracted (ignoring comparisons with NULL pointers and
	with pointers obtained by casting an error code to a pointer type)
	has been used.
</div>
<p>
The test turned up a number of places where such operations were taking
place, but none of them turned out to be situations where the pointer tags
changed the kernel's behavior; see the patch posting linked above for the
full discussion.
<p>
There is a small set of benchmark results included in the patch as well; it
shows that software-tag-based KASAN performs similarly to regular KASAN in
terms of CPU usage, though network bandwidth does drop somewhat.  The new
mode does use quite a bit less memory, though, as expected.  KASAN remains
far from free in either mode, though, tripling the time required for the
test system to boot and reducing the networking performance to less than
half of what is otherwise possible.  So it is still going to be hard to use
KASAN in production systems most of the time.
<p>
Upcoming technologies, such
as Arm's <a
href="https://community.arm.com/processors/b/blog/posts/arm-a-profile-architecture-2018-developments-armv85a">memory
tagging</a>, promise to support much of this functionality in hardware,
which may change the equation somewhat.

For the time being, though, KASAN must be implemented in software.  It has
found a number of bugs in the kernel, and would certainly find more if it
were able to run in more contexts.  The software-tag-based mode should make
it possible to use KASAN on systems where its memory overhead is currently
prohibitive, and that seems like a good thing.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm pretty certain that the kernel can have more then 256 live allocations at any given time, hence, tag collisions are guaranteed to happen even when regarding "about 4 collisions in 1000 allocations" as "small probability" (doesn't seem small to me). And there's of course Knuth's classic statement that a arbitrarily long sequence of twos is a perfectly random sequence. This means if this mechanism considers an access valid, there's absolutely no way to determine that it's actually valid short of examining the code for correct pointer usages. And if this was such an easy thing to do, surely, there shouldn't be any incorrect pointer uses.<br>

<p>
If you've only got 256 possible tag values, then I would think that the probability of a collision is more than 50% with just 25 live allocations. Think birthday paradox.<br>
<p>
You only need 30 people, chosen at random, for the chances of two of them sharing a birthday to go over 50%. That's 30 people, 365 days, and a collision. Extrapolating (yes I know that's very dangerous with statistics), I would guess that once a hash table is over 10% full, the chances of a collision go over 50%.<br>

Right. However you shouldn't worry about two unrelated pointers sharing the same tag. You should wonder what's the probability of one pointer gone rogue pointing out of its original bounds into the range of another pointer, and *those* two pointers sharing the same tag.<br>

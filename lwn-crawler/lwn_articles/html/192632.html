<h1>revoke() and frevoke()</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 25, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
A system call found in some Unix variants is <tt>revoke()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    int revoke(const char *path);
</pre>
<p>
This call exists to disconnect processes from files; when called with a
given <tt>path</tt>, it will shut down all open file descriptors which
refer to the file found at the end of that path.  Its initial purpose was
to defeat people writing programs that would sit on a serial port and
pretend to be <tt>login</tt>.  As soon as <tt>revoke()</tt> was called with
the device file corresponding to the serial port, any login spoofer would
find itself disconnected from the port and unable to fool anybody.  Other
potential uses exist as well; consider, for example, disconnecting a
process from a file which is preventing the unmounting of a filesystem.
<p>

Linux has never had this system call, but this situation could change
before too long; Pekka Enberg has posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/192107/">an implementation of
<tt>revoke()</tt></a> for review.  Pekka has also added a second version:
<p>
<pre>
    int frevoke(int fd);
</pre>
<p>
This version, of course, takes an open file descriptor as its argument.  In
either case, the calling process must either own the file, or it must be
able to override file permissions.  So <tt>revoke()</tt> gives a process
the ability to yank an open file out from underneath processes owned by
other users, as long as that process owns the file in question.
<p>

Getting this operation right can be a little tricky, with the result that
the current implementation makes some compromises which may not sit well
with other developers.  The process, simplified, is this:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The code loops through every process on the system; for each process,
     it iterates through the open file table looking for file descriptors
     corresponding to the file being revoked.  Every time it finds one, it
     zeroes out the file descriptor entry (making that descriptor
     unavailable to its erstwhile owner).  The file is not actually closed,
     however; instead, a list of files to be closed is created for later
     action.  
     <p>
     All of this will be rather slow, but that should not be a
     huge problem: <tt>revoke()</tt> is not a performance-critical
     operation.  The memory allocation (to add an entry to the list of
     files to close) is a bit more problematic; if it fails,
     <tt>revoke()</tt> will abort partway through, having done an unknown
     amount of damage without having accomplished its goal.
<p>
<li> Once all open file descriptors have been shut down, the files
     themselves can be closed.  So <tt>revoke()</tt> steps through the list
     it created, closing each open file.
<p>
<li> There is one sticky little problem remaining: some processes may have
     used <tt>mmap()</tt> to map the file into their address spaces.  The
     <tt>revoke()</tt> call clearly has to do something about those memory
     areas, or it will not have completed the job.  So a pass through all
     of the virtual memory areas associated with the file is required; for
     each one, the <tt>nopage()</tt> method is set to a special version
     which returns an error status.
     <p>
     That change will keep a process from faulting in new pages from the
     revoked file, but does nothing about the pages which are already part
     of the process's address space.  To fix those, it is necessary to
     wander through the page tables of each process having mapped the file,
     clearing out any page table entries referring to pages from that file.
</ul>
<p>

An alternative approach can be seen in the <a
href="http://developer.osdl.org/dev/fumount/kernel2/patches/2.6.13-rc3/2/">forced
unmount patch</a> by Tigran Aivazian, which has been touched by a number of
other developers over its fairly long history
 (its comments include a credit for the
port to the 2.6 kernel).  This patch has a different final goal - being
able to unmount a filesystem regardless of any current activity - but it
must solve the same problem of revoking access to all files on the target
filesystem.  Rather than clearing out file descriptors, this patch replaces
the underlying <tt>file</tt> structure with a new one from the "badfs"
filesystem.  After this change, any attempted operations on the file will
return <tt>EIO</tt>.  Memory mappings are cleared with a direct call to
<tt>munmap()</tt>. 
<p>
The final form of the patch may well be a combination of the two, providing
both forced unmount and <tt>revoke()</tt> functionality.  In the process,
some of the remaining issues (such as how to perform safe locking without
slowing down the highly-optimized <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt>
paths) will need to be worked out.  But there is clearly demand for these
features, so this work will probably proceed to eventual inclusion in the
mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Also very useful for not letting a user keep a daemon open recording from a system's sound card or camera when they're logged out, while still letting them legitimately access them when logged in at the console. AFAIK there's no secure implementation of that for linux currently, so here's looking forward to revoke()!<br>

      Shouldn't this be a fairly simple shellscript?<br>
Just lsof for the device files in question and kill all processes of the logging out user that still have them open.<br>

      <p>Could not some of that be userspace?</p>
<ul>
<li>find open files on filesystem, and there owning processes</li>
<li>kill the processes in question*</li>
<li>unmount filesystem</li>
</ul>
<p>* This _needs_ to be in userspace, so the user (who most likely 
asked for the unmount in the first place) can do something about it (save 
unsaved files...)</p>
<p>But maybe my knowledge is just out-dated, and this is already the 
case, and the problem at hand is a different one...</p>

      You don't always want to kill the process; many processes could handle a file being closed without having to terminate, and would want to if it was multithreaded, with one thread using that file (eg, disconnecting a file from a browser, you wouldn't want to lose all browser windows).<br>
<p>
It could also be the kernel that has the file open (eg, mounted into the filesystem using loopback block device); killing the kernel to release the file isn't desirable =)<br>
<p>
I think if you're detaching files, a signal should be sent to processes at the same time, so they know the file is closed before they try and fail a read/write.<br>

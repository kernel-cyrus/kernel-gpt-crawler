<h1>Linus merges up a storm</h1>

While Linus took a week off, Andrew Morton maintained a "merge candidate"
tree full of patches which were to be added to the mainline on Linus's
return.  Linus is back; he has been quiet on linux-kernel, but his
BitKeeper repository shows that he has been busy: over 700 patches have
been merged in the first half of this week.  Quite a few of these are
significant; there will be a lot of changes in the 2.6.6 kernel.  Here's a
quick list of some of the more important additions.
<p>
<ul>

<li> The usual pile of architecture updates, including x86_64, PPC, ARM,
     ia64, m68k-noMMU, S/390, and others.
<p>
<li> <a href="http://www-users.mat.uni.torun.pl/~wrona/posix_ipc/">POSIX
     message queue</a> support.   
<p>
<li> Changes to the ext2 and ext3 filesystems which provide significant
     speedups for the <tt>fsync()</tt> and <tt>fdatasync()</tt> calls.
     Various other performance improvements have been added to those
     filesystems as well.
<p>
<li> The addition of the <tt>fcntl()</tt> method to the
     <tt>file_operations</tt> structure (see the <a
     href="/Articles/76338/">March 24 Kernel Page</a>).
<p>
<li> The "laptop mode" patch.  This patch has evolved somewhat since we
     last <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/65437/">looked at it</a>, but
     the basic idea remains the same: avoid spinning up the disk whenever
     possible, but, when you do have to perform disk activity, do
     everything you can.
<p>
<li> 4KB kernel stacks for the i386 architecture.  This patch reduces the
     kernel's per-process overhead, which is useful for people trying to
     run thousands of threads.  It also removes one of the few places where
     the kernel needs to allocate multiple, physically-contiguous pages.
     In 2.6.6, there is a configuration option allowing the continued use
     of 8KB stacks, though the plan is to eventually remove this option.
     The configured stack size is stored in modules, so it will not be
     possible to load a module which was built for the wrong size stack.
<p>
<li> Non-executable stack support for several architectures.  This is not
     the full "Exec shield" patch from Ingo Molnar, though parts of that
     patch appear here.
<p>
<li> A big reiserfs update, including <tt>data=ordered</tt> support, space
     preallocation, laptop mode support, and more.
<p>
<li> IPv6 support in SELinux.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/79326/">lightweight auditing framework</a>.
<p>
<li> A mechanism which allows block drivers to respond to queries about the
     congestion state of their queues.  This is useful for higher-level
     drivers (i.e. the device mapper) which have a complicated queue state.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/75233/">per-device unplugging patch</a> which
     makes some significant changes to the block layer, but which yields
     significant performance improvements.  This patch has evolved a lot
     since it was originally posted, mostly to deal with complexities in
     the device mapper, RAID, and swapping code.
<p>
<li> The "completely fair queueing" (CFQ) I/O scheduler (covered here <a
     href="/Articles/57732/">last November</a>).  This scheduler tries to
     evenly divide disk bandwidth among all processes on the system.  The
     CFQ scheduler can be chosen with a configuration option, or by booting
     with the <tt>elevator="cfq"</tt> option.
<p>
<li> Some software suspend fixes, including support for systems with high
     memory. 
<p>
<li> The external module support patch (described in a separate article
     below).  The behavior of "<tt>make clean</tt>" has also been reworked
     to do a more thorough job while, simultaneously, leaving behind enough
     information to allow the building of external modules.
<p>
<li> A new configuration option allowing the building of kernels without
     sysfs support.  Be sure to read the help text before disabling sysfs,
     however; without sysfs the kernel needs more explicit help in finding
     its root partition.
<p>
<li> Various libata (serial ATA) improvements and fixes.
<p>
<li> A long list of NFS cleanups and improvements.
<p>
<li> Some cosmetic fixes, such as running devfs and the floppy driver
     through <tt>lindent</tt>.
<p>
<li> Some significant page cache and virtual memory changes, which we will
     get to in the next article.
</ul>
<p>

Overall, one might be forgiven for thinking that 2.6.6 looks much like a
development kernel release.  In fact, most of more intrusive patches listed
above have been around and tested for some time now; they have just finally
made their escape from the -mm tree.  With the exception of the CPU
scheduler patches (which we hope to cover here next week) and, perhaps, the
reverse mapping VM changes, 2.6.6 looks likely to contain the bulk of the
work that most developers are still hoping to see added to 2.6.  2.6.6
contains enough big changes that its chances of containing an unpleasant
surprise or two are fairly high.  Within a few more releases, however, 2.6
may well have stabilized to the point that it can be more widely deployed
and the bulk of developer attention can move on to 2.7.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I've been wishing reiserfs had a data=ordered option for some time.  It <br>should come in particularly handy on this not yet completely stable x86_64 <br>(amd64) system, running 100% reiserfs.  I've not had any serious issues, <br>but because reiserfs is a metadata journalling system not a data <br>journalling system, sometimes the file system cleanups upon reboot DO put <br>extraneous data into the file, from elsewhere.  Putting sync in crontab to <br>execute every minute has helped significantly, however.  I should also <br>mention that somewhere between 2.6.4 and 2.6.5rc2 (I missed 2.6.5rc1), <br>something DRAMATIC changed, and stability increased by an order of <br>magnitude.  Before that, I was beginning to seriously question my decision <br>to go 64-bit, and wishing I was still running x86-32-bit, with its better <br>stability. <br> <br>Duncan <br>

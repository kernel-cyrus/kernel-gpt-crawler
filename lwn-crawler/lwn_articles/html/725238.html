<p>Many benchmarks have been used by kernel developers over the years to
test the performance of the scheduler. But recent kernel commit messages
have shown a particular pattern of tools being used (some relatively new),
all of which were created specifically for developing scheduler patches.
While each benchmark is different, having its own unique genesis story and
intended testing scenario, there is a unifying attribute; they were all
written to scratch a developer's itch.</p>

<h4>Hackbench</h4>

<p><a
href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/hackbench.8.html">Hackbench</a>
is a message-passing scheduler benchmark that allows developers to 
configure both the communication mechanism (pipes or sockets) and the task
configuration (POSIX threads or processes). This benchmark is a stalwart of
kernel scheduler testing, and has had more versions than the Batman
franchise.  It was <a
href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0112.1/0702.html">originally
created</a> in 2001 by Rusty Russell to demonstrate the improved
performance of the <a
href="http://lse.sourceforge.net/scheduling/mq1.html">multi-queue
scheduler</a> patch series. Over the years, many people have added their
contributions to Russell's version, including Ingo Molnar, Yanmin Zhang,
and David Sommerseth. Hitoshi Mitake added the most recent incarnation to
the kernel source tree as part of the <tt>perf-bench</tt> tool in 2009.</p>
<p>
Here's an example of the output of <tt>perf-bench</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    $ perf bench sched pipe
    # Running 'sched/pipe' benchmark:
    # Executed 1000000 pipe operations between two processes

         Total time: 3.643 [sec]

           3.643867 usecs/op
             274433 ops/sec
</pre>
<p>
The output of the benchmark is the average
scheduler wakeup latency — the duration between telling a task it
needs to wake up to perform work and that task running on a CPU. When
analyzing latency, it's important to look at as many latency samples
as possible because outliers (high-latency values) can be hidden by a
summary statistic, such as the arithmetic mean.
It's quite easy to miss those high latency events if the only data you
have is the average latency, but scheduler wakeup delays can quickly
lead to major performance issues.

<p>Because hackbench calculates an average latency for communicating a
fixed amount of data between two tasks, it is most often used by developers
who are making changes to the scheduler's 
load-balancing code. On the flip side, the lack of data for analyzing the
entire latency distribution makes it difficult to dig into scheduler
latency wakeup issues without using tracing tools.</p> 

<h4>Schbench</h4>

<p>One benchmark that does provide detailed latency distribution statistics
for scheduler wakeups is <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/schbench.git/">schbench</a>. It
allows users to configure the usual parameters — such as number of tasks
and test duration — but also the time between wakeups
(<tt>--sleeptime</tt>), time 
spinning once woken (<tt>--cputime</tt>); it also has the ability to
automatically 
increase the task count until the 99th percentile wakeup latencies become
extreme.</p>


<p>Schbench was created by Chris Mason in 2016 while forward porting some
kernel patches that Facebook was carrying to improve the <a
href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=145987986404475">performance
of its workloads</a>.  "Schbench allowed me to quickly test a variety
of theories as we 
were forward porting our old patches", Mason said in a private
email.

It has since become useful for more than that, and Facebook now uses it
for performance regression detection, investigating performance issues, and
benchmarking patches before they're posted upstream.</p> 
<p>

Here's an example showing the detailed statistics produced by
schbench:
<p>
<pre>
    $ ./schbench -t 16 -m 2
    Latency percentiles (usec)
	50.0000th: 15
	75.0000th: 24
	90.0000th: 26
	95.0000th: 30
	*99.0000th: 85
	99.5000th: 1190
	99.9000th: 7272
	min=0, max=7270
</pre>

<p>The scheduler wakeup latency distribution that schbench prints at the
end of the benchmark run is one of its distinguishing features, and was one
of the main rationales for creating it.  Mason continued: "The
focus on p99 latencies 
instead of average latencies is the most important part. For us, lots of
problems only show up when you start looking at the long tail in the
latency graphs."

It's also a true micro-benchmark, including only the bare minimum
code required to simulate Facebook's workloads while ensuring the
scheduler is the slowest part of the code path.</p> 

<p>Publishing this benchmark has provided a common tool for discussing
Facebook's workloads with upstream developers, and non-Facebook
engineers are now using it to test their scheduler changes, which Mason is
very happy with: "I'm really grateful when I see people using
schbench to help validate new patches going in."</p> 

<h4>Adrestia</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mfleming/adrestia">Adrestia</a> is a
dirt-simple scheduler wakeup latency micro-benchmark that
contains even less code than schbench.

I wrote it in 2016 to measure scheduler latency without using the
<tt>futex()</tt> system call as is done in schbench in order to provide
more coverage by testing a different kernel subsystem in the scheduler
wakeup path. I also needed something that
had fewer bells and whistles and was trivial to configure. While schbench
models Facebook's workloads, Adrestia is designed only to provide the
95th-percentile wakeup latency value, which provides a simple answer to the
question: "What is the typical maximum wakeup latency value?"</p> 

<p>I use adrestia to detect performance regressions of patches
merged, and to validate potential patches as they're posted to the
linux-kernel mailing list.

It has been particularly useful for triggering regressions caused by
changes to the cpufreq code, mainly because I test with wakeup
times that are a multiple of 32ms — the Linux scheduling period. Using
multiples of the scheduling period allows the CPU frequency to be reduced
before the next wakeup, and thus provides an understanding of the effects of
frequency selection on scheduler wakeup latencies. This turns out to be
important when validating performance because many enterprise distributions
ship with the intel_pstate driver enabled and the default governor set to
"powersave".</p> 

<a name="rt-app"></a>
<h4>Rt-app</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/scheduler-tools/rt-app">Rt-app</a> is a
highly configurable real-time workload simulator that accepts 
a JSON grammar for describing task execution and periodicity.

It was originally created by Giacomo Bagnoli as part of his <a
href="https://retis.sssup.it/?q=node/77">master's
thesis</a> so that he could create background tasks to induce scheduler
latency and test his Linux kernel changes for low-latency audio. Juri Lelli
started working on it around 2010 when he began his efforts on the
deadline scheduler project, again, for his <a
href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/14699805.pdf">master's
thesis [PDF]</a>. Lelli said (in a private email) that he used rt-app while
writing his thesis because 
it was the in-house testing solution at RetisLab (Scuola Superiore
Sant'Anna University) at the time, "I didn't also know about
any other tool that was able to create synthetic sets base on a JSON
description".</p> 

<p>Today, ARM and Linaro are using rt-app to trigger specific scheduler
code paths. It is a flexible tool that can be used to test small
scheduling and load-balancing changes; it is also useful for generating
end-to-end 
workload performance and power figures. Because of its flexibility
(and expressive JSON grammar) it is heavily used to model workloads when
they are impractical to run directly, such as Android benchmarks on mainline
Linux.

"You want to use it to abstract complexity and test for regressions
across different platforms/os stacks/back/forward ports", said
Lelli.</p> 

<p>Lelli himself uses it primarily for handling bug reports because he can
model problematic workloads without having to run the actual application
stack. He also uses it for regression testing; the rt-app
source repository has amassed a large collection of configurations
for workloads that have caused regressions in the past.

Many developers run rt-app indirectly via <a
href="https://github.com/ARM-software/lisa">ARM's
LISA framework</a>, since LISA further abstracts the creation of rt-app
configuration files and also includes libraries to post-process the rt-app
trace data.</p> 

<p>If modeling of complex workloads is needed when testing scheduler
changes, rt-app appears to be the obvious choice.
"It's useful to model (almost) any sort of real-world
application without coding it from scratch - you just need to be fluent
with its own JSON grammar&hellip; I'm actually relatively
confident that for example it shouldn't be too difficult to create
{hackbench,cyclictest,etc.}-like type of workloads with
rt-app".</p>
<p>
<h4>In closing</h4>
<p>

<a
href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/traditional-benchmark-lifespan">Benchmarks
offer benefits</a> that no other tool can; they can help developers
communicate the important bits of a workload by paring it back to its core,
making it simple to reproduce reported performance issues, and ensuring that
performance doesn't regress.
Yet a large number of performance-improving kernel patches contain no
benchmark numbers at all. That's slowly starting to change for the
scheduler subsystem with the help of the benchmarks mentioned above.
But if you can't find a benchmark that represents your workload, maybe
it's time to write your own, and finally scratch that itch.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

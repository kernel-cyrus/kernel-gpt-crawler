<p>There is no doubt that the addition of container
technologies to Linux has created a lot of value,
allowing workloads to be effectively and efficiently isolated from each other.
Implementing these technologies presents a number of challenges,
particularly as much of Linux and Unix was designed to use singletons:
objects of which there could never ever be more than one, such as
host names, network routing tables, or process-ID namespaces.
Containers require this design approach to be revised as they need
multiple instances of these objects.  A 
singleton that has been causing problems recently is the set of pseudo
terminals (TTYs).</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal">pseudo TTY</a>
(or &quot;PTY&quot;) is a pair of devices — a slave and a master — that
provide a special sort of communication channel.  The slave
device behaves much like the device representing the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A">ADM-3A</a> &quot;dumb
terminal&quot; that we all have on our desks ... or that we might have had
a few decades ago.  It can read and write text as though it were
a physical terminal, it can enable or disable echo
of typed characters, etc.  The master acts more like the person
sitting in front of that dumb terminal.  Writing to the master is exactly
like typing on a terminal.  If echo is enabled, then everything written can
immediately be read back, and writing a backspace effectively causes the
previous character typed to be forgotten.  Modern computers typically have
very few, if any, physical terminals, but potentially lots of
PTYs to support text-based interfaces as provided by terminal emulators
(such as <tt>xterm</tt> or <tt>gnome-terminal</tt>) and remote access
interfaces like SSH.</p> 

<h4>Opening a pseudo TTY</h4>

<p>The history of pseudo TTYs contains the sort of mix of clever ideas and
unfortunate choices that we've come to expect in fast-moving technology.
The original implementation provided a fixed number of master/slave pairs
which, like all other devices, had permanent device nodes in
<tt>/dev</tt>.  <tt>/dev/ptyp9</tt> would be a master device, for example, and
<tt>/dev/ttyp9</tt> would be the matching slave device.  An application
or service that needed a PTY would try to open each master device in turn
until it succeeded with one; it would then have exclusive access to that
PTY.  The application would 
change the ownership of the slave to match the user it was providing access
to and hand the slave to whatever command shell or similar program was
appropriate.  If a non-privileged application needed to allocate a PTY it
would need a setuid helper program to update the ownership of the slave
device node in <tt>/dev</tt>.</p>

<p>While this worked, it was far from elegant, particularly as the number of
PTYs configured on systems headed into the hundreds and the search for a
free master device became a greater waste of time.  So, with the
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">&quot;Unix98&quot;
Single Unix Specification</a> (SUS), a new approach was adopted.  An <a
href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/posix_openpt.html">abstract
interface</a> was defined to allow the writing of portable code without
imposing a single mechanism on all implementations, as the committee was
not able to agree on any one universal mechanism.  In February 1998, Linux
2.1.87 brought <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/diff/drivers/char/pty.c?id=a03099aa6e53e66556191b0ae6d486f1688e6665">support for the <tt>/dev/ptmx</tt> multiplexing master device</a>.
Opening this device provides access to an otherwise unused pseudo TTY
master and allows the matching slave to be identified using an
<tt>ioctl()</tt>.  This makes implementations of
<tt>posix_openpt()</tt> and <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ptsname.3.html"><tt>ptsname()</tt></a>
<!-- ahem! :) -->
quite straightforward.</p> 

<p>In April of that year, Linux 2.1.93
added <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/diff/fs/devpts/inode.c?id=3dd28001365ad624202828cdccc64391ea0043e0">a
new virtual filesystem</a> called <tt>devpts</tt> that is normally 
mounted at <tt>/dev/pts</tt>.  Whenever a new master/slave pair is
created, a device node for the slave is created in that virtual filesystem.
This device node is given an owner and group matching the
owner and group of the process that opened <tt>/dev/ptmx</tt>,
though either can be overridden by mount options.  With this there is no
need for a setuid helper program.  At least there shouldn't be.</p>

<p>There is just one little problem: SUS <a
href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/grantpt.html">requires</a>
that the group ID of the slave device should <i>not</i> be that of the
creating 
process, but rather some definite, though unspecified, value.
The GNU C Library (glibc) takes responsibility for implementing this
requirement; it quite
reasonably chooses the ID of the group named &quot;tty&quot; (often&nbsp;5) to
fill this role.  If the <tt>devpts</tt> filesystem is mounted with
options <tt>gid=5,mode=620</tt>, this group ID and the required
access mode will be used and glibc will be happy.  If not, glibc will (if so
configured) run a setuid helper found at <tt>/usr/libexec/pt_chown</tt>.
<p>
As Eric Biederman <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/878u0s3orx.fsf_-_@x220.int.ebiederm.org">discovered</a>,
<a href="https://manned.org/xen-create-image"><tt>xen-create-image</tt></a>
mounts <tt>devpts</tt> in a
  chroot while creating a new root filesystem, and does so without these
  options.  Just why this is interesting will become clear a little
  later.
</p>

<h4>Seeing the singletons</h4>

<p>This design for PTYs created two related singletons: the master multiplexer
<tt>/dev/ptmx</tt> and the slave virtual filesystem
<tt>/dev/pts</tt>.  Abstracting a singleton object to be different in
different containers has been done multiple times and the process is well
understood. 
When there are two distinct but related singletons as we have here, there is
more complexity that must be carefully managed.  These details were thought
to have been addressed back in 2009 when <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/devpts.txt">container
support</a> was added to the pseudo TTY subsystem.
<p>
With this change, it became possible to
mount distinct instances of the <tt>devpts</tt> filesystem, each with its own
set of pseudo TTYs.  A new &quot;ptmx&quot; file was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1f8f1e296583f9f832c2fe7b5a219675b74bf43e">created</a>
<i>inside</i> the mounted <tt>devpts</tt> filesystem instance; opening this
<tt>pts/ptmx</tt> file would always create slave nodes in the same
filesystem instance.  It was expected that <tt>/dev/ptmx</tt> would be 
changed to be a symbolic link to <tt>pts/ptmx</tt>; containers could then
just mount their own <tt>devpts</tt> filesystem and, as it was now a
self-contained entity, everything would be happy.  Unfortunately not
everyone got the memo.  While some container libraries configure
<tt>/dev/ptmx</tt> like this, the practice isn't universal.</p>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is that a device node for <tt>ptmx</tt>
that is
created explicitly with <tt>mknod</tt>, rather than created implicitly in a
<tt>devpts</tt> instance, is still a singleton, so there must be a unique,
global <tt>devpts</tt> filesystem where slave nodes are
created when the singleton <tt>ptmx</tt> node is opened.  To ensure
backward compatibility, an attempt to mount a <tt>devpts</tt>
filesystem will normally mount this single-instance unless the
<tt>newinstance</tt> mount option is provided.  This way, old
installations get what they expect, new code has control and can get what
is needed.  It seems like a reasonably clean, if slightly inelegant,
solution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is a problem, and here at last we find out why that
setuid helper program is relevant.  Setuid programs are always a little
bit risky — it is important that they cannot be tricked into doing the
wrong thing, so they must be provided with complete information in ways that
cannot easily be forged.  The setuid <tt>pt_chown</tt> tool is given the master side of
the new PTY as an open file descriptor and the user ID to change its ownership to as the
process's real UID.  It then needs to find the slave node, which can be done
using <tt>ptsname()</tt>.
In a system with multiple devpts instances mounted,
the information <tt>pt_chown</tt> gives to <tt>ptsname()</tt> is no longer
complete as 
it does not identify which <tt>devpts</tt> instance to use; that can lead
to unfortunate consequences.  </p>

<h4>What is your <em>real</em> name?</h4>

<p>In Linux 3.9, it <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ec2aa8e8dd7d35524a68c89b9e7ceb07fb002561">became
possible</a> for an unprivileged user to mount a new
<tt>devpts</tt>  instance in a private <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/">user namespace</a>.  If that user
ensured this mount was still visible in the global namespace, a program
running there would be able to open the new <tt>ptmx</tt> device and get a file
descriptor of a PTY master with any arbitrary index number.  This would be
quite distinct from any PTY in the global <tt>/dev/pts/</tt> but,
crucially, <tt>ptsname()</tt> doesn't know that.
<tt>ptsname()</tt> simply
<a
href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/ptsname.c;h=179ae6a2938dc35a51ae4b9fb89f7b037a05450e;hb=ab30899d880f9741a409cbc0d7a28399bdac21bf#l86">calls
the <tt>ioctl()</tt></a> to find the index number for the PTY, and 
constructs a path name in <tt>/dev/pts/</tt>.  So if the master file
descriptor could be passed to a 
setuid <tt>pt_chown</tt>, it would change the ownership of a PTY that was,
in all probability, owned by someone else.
The ability to take ownership of a PTY connected to a root shell, for
example, has obvious value to somebody wishing to compromise the system.
</p>

<p>The obvious response to this would be to get rid of
<tt>pt_chown</tt>, simply because it is a setuid program that isn't
needed — providing devpts was mounted with the proper options.
Unfortunately this isn't obvious to everyone.  Pulling other 
threads of this story together, if you run <tt>xen-create-image</tt>, 
it will mount the <tt>devpts</tt> filesystem within its chroot environment
with no options.  This 
mounts the singleton instance, and imposes the default options on it (which
are not the preferred options).

If, as is normally the case, the singleton instance is already mounted
outside the chroot at <tt>/dev/pts</tt> with options like
<tt>gid=5,mode=620</tt>, the default options will be implicitly imposed
there too — overwriting the previous options.  Without <tt>pt_chown</tt>
this will 
result in slave PTYs getting the wrong group owner, which breaks a number
of applications.

<p>
The right solution would be to fix <tt>xen-create-image</tt>.
Biederman reported that, rather than taking that approach,
"<q>some distributions
have been working around this problem by continuing 
    to install a setuid root pt_chown binary that will be called by glibc
    to fix the permissions.</q>"  In the absence of multiple-instance
<tt>devpts</tt>, this may be clumsy but it 
works and has no obvious security problems.  With the introduction of
multiple-instance <tt>devpts</tt> and allowing unprivileged mounts in
user namespaces, a potential security issue has arisen.  This problem came up
as a result of 
changes in the kernel, so it is up to the kernel developers to address
the issue, even though it is only there because of questionable
practices in user-space code.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, this problem only affects installations with a setuid
<tt>pt_chown</tt>, with a v3.9 or later Linux kernel, and with the
non-default CONFIG_USER_NS configuration option enabled.</p>

<h4>Search for a solution</h4>

<p>The best solution would address the problem without any
change to user space.  This would require a kernel change so that the
current <tt>pt_chown</tt> program either failed to recognize the given
file descriptor as representing a PTY master, or failed when it tried to
change ownership.  Neither of these are possible with any sort of elegance.
<tt>pt_chown</tt> identifies the master by using the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/tty/pty.c?id=2dcd0af568b0cf583645c8a317dd12e344b1c72a#n610">TIOCGPTN</a>
ioctl which just returns a number used to identify the slave.  Any change
to this would be likely to break some other program too.</p>

<p>As no kernel change could be sufficient, some glibc change is required.
It would probably be possible to change <tt>ptsname()</tt> to perform
more checks before performing the ownership change, such as ensuring that
the inode and device numbers of the passed file descriptor match that which
is reported by <tt>lstat(&quot;/dev/ptmx&quot;)</tt>.  It may even be
possible to make this work reliably on all kernels and all Linux
distributions.  But this far from certain and the approach only serves to
perpetuate an undesirable setuid program: nobody really wants that.</p>

<p>So the preferred approach is a glibc configuration change rather than a
code change: deprecate <tt>pt_chown</tt> and convince all distributions to
remove it.  This suggests that a way needs to be found to support
the somewhat strange usage in <tt>xen-create-image</tt> without the need
for <tt>pt_chown</tt>.

<p>Biederman's plan for
this is to discard the &quot;singleton&quot; instance of
<tt>devpts</tt> completely.  Once implemented, every mount of
<tt>devpts</tt> will be a new instance, so when
<tt>xen-create-image</tt> performs the mount with default options, that
won't affect the mount options on the system <tt>/dev/pts</tt>.  If all
distributions had already changed <tt>/dev/ptmx</tt> to be a symlink to
<tt>pts/ptmx</tt> in all cases, this would be a trivial change and
nobody would notice.  But that change has not been universally made.</p>

<p>Since the separate <tt>ptmx</tt> device node (created via
<tt>mknod()</tt> in <tt>/dev</tt>) is still widely in use, it must
be changed so that, instead of using the singleton
<tt>devpts</tt> (which will no longer exist), it uses the
right one for the particular context in which it is accessed.
When Beiderman's new version of <tt>ptmx</tt> is opened, it will
look for the name &quot;pts&quot; in the same directory that
<tt>ptmx</tt> was found and see if that is a mount point of the
<tt>devpts</tt> filesystem.  If it is, a new PTY will be allocated in
that filesystem.  If it isn't, an error will be returned.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly an odd behavior for a character-special device to
have.  We are used to symbolic links behaving differently when found
in different directories, but not character devices.  There was a
<a href="http:thread.gmane.org/0A2DB3DF-3D96-4B9B-85AC-E7C4DBDF0E9B@zytor.com">suggestion</a> that the <tt>ptmx</tt> device could make itself look like a
symbolic link, but this turned out to be much more easily said than
done, and it is not clear that this would be a more elegant solution,
just a different one.</p>

<p> To summarize the intent behind these changes: enabling a regular
<tt>ptmx</tt> 
device to find and use a nearby mount of <tt>devpts</tt> makes it possible
to get rid of the singleton version of the <tt>devpts</tt> filesystem and
have every mount create a new instance.  Once this is done, the unusual
usage in <tt>xen-create-image</tt> (or any other unusual usage that might
be out there) will only have local effect and cannot impose non-standard
options on the "system" <tt>/dev/pts</tt>.  Then there will no
longer be any excuse to install <tt>pt_chown</tt>, so we can strongly
encourage distributions and users to remove it.  At that point, the
security problems that arise when enabling both <tt>CONFIG_USER_NS</tt> and
<tt>pt_chown</tt> will no longer be an issue.


<h4>Might this break something else?</h4>

<p>This change, <a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/87wpskyds7.fsf_-_@x220.int.ebiederm.org">first
proposed</a> by Biederman in December, has not had an easy path to the
kernel.  Once it became clear that some sort of semantic change was needed,
the question arose as to which changes might be safe and which changes
might break things.  Linus Torvalds's <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/CA+55aFzCQ5MEs0C21SSobgpx-zGKxK67ur1Q45s+wn-nWZ56nw@mail.gmail.com">dictum</a>
that we mustn't break user space does not mean that we cannot change the
behavior of the kernel, only that we cannot change a behavior that is
reasonably being depended on.  There was some <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/87twjcorwg.fsf@x220.int.ebiederm.org">disagreement</a>
as to exactly what could or could not be changed in this case.</p>

<p>To his great credit, Biederman has assembled a considerable array of
different distributions to test his changes on.  The <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/87y47nrors.fsf_-_@x220.int.ebiederm.org">most
recent patch</a> makes the claim that:</p>
<p>
<div class=BigQuote>
This has been verified to work properly on openwrt-15.05, centos5,
centos6, centos7, debian-6.0.2, debian-7.9, debian-8.2,
ubuntu-14.04.3, ubuntu-15.10, fedora23, magia-5, mint-17.3,
opensuse-42.1, slackware-14.1, gentoo-20151225 (13.0?),
archlinux-2015-12-01.  With the caveat that on centos6 and on
slackware-14.1 that there wind up being two instances of the devpts
filesystem mounted on /dev/pts, the lower copy does not end up getting
used.
</div>

<p>which provides quite a high level of confidence that existing
behaviors aren't broken.</p>

<p>This last patch is considerably smaller than some earlier attempts, in
part because Torvalds committed some <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=67245ff332064c01b760afa7a384ccda024bfd24">clean-up</a>
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8ead9dd54716d1e05e129959f702fcc1786f82b4">patches</a>
himself to make the code more approachable.  It was a little <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/20160506195459.GB27790@kroah.com">too late</a>
for Greg Kroah-Hartman — as TTY maintainer — to accept it for the 4.7
cycle, but it seems likely that this new approach to <tt>devpts</tt>
where every mount is a new instance will land for Linux 4.8.  The next step
will, presumably, be to actively encourage those distributions that
currently ship a setuid <tt>pt_chown</tt> to stop doing so.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

setuid pt_chown as a bad idea isn't a new discovery.  CVE-2013-2207 documents this, and the solution in glibc was to stop building &amp; installing it by default:<br>
  <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15755">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15755</a><br>
this has been the behavior with the glibc-2.18+ release.<br>
<p>
somewhat fortuitously, Gentoo dropped pt_chown a few months before to be proactive along the lines of "set*id is bad".  this was applied to glibc-2.16+ versions.<br>
  <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/465308">https://bugs.gentoo.org/465308</a><br>
<p>
so what current distros are still passing --enable-pt_chown ?  i'm not seeing it in Fedora's rpm spec files, nor in Debian's file list for libc-bin (which is based on glibc-2.19).  Ubuntu has it up through wily, but looks like they finally dropped it in xenial.<br>

Debian did it until a few months ago, and I thiiink Ubuntu only pulled that change from them. See Debian's changelog:<br>

The code was merged for 4.7-rc2<br>
<p>
xen-create-image is not the only problematic piece of userspace code, but rather a concrete example of a mistake that is easy to make.<br>
<p>
Confusing a setuid pt_chown has been possible since multiple instances of devpts were introduced.<br>
<p>
The reasons for changing the behavior of what happens when devpts is mounted go beyond any concerns about a setuid pt_chown.   The need for the newinstance option to devpts has been an imperfect solution from the start.<br>

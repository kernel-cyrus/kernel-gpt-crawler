<p>When <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">virtio</a>
was merged in Linux v2.6.24, its author, Rusty Russell, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ec3d41c4db4c">described 
the goal</a> as being for "<q>common drivers to be efficiently used
across most virtual I/O 
mechanisms</q>".  Today, much progress has been made toward that goal, with virtio
supported by multiple hypervisors and guest drivers shipped by many operating
systems.  But these applications of virtio are implemented in software, whereas
Michael Tsirkin's "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmxF/virtio-without-the-virt-towards-implementations-in-hardware-michael-tsirkin-red-hat">VirtIO
without the Virt</a>" talk at KVM Forum 2019 laid out how
to implement virtio in hardware.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>

<p>One might ask why it makes sense to implement virtio devices in hardware.
After all, they were originally designed for hypervisors and have been
optimized for software rather than hardware implementation.  Now that virtio
support is widespread, the network effects allow hardware implementations to
reuse the guest drivers and infrastructure.  The <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/virtio-v1.1.html">virtio
1.1 specification</a>
defines ten device types, among them a network interface, SCSI host bus
adapter, and console.  Implementing a standards-compliant device interface lets
hardware implementers focus on delivering the best device instead of designing
a new device interface and writing guest drivers from scratch.
Moreover, existing guests will work with the device out of the box, and
applications utilizing user-space drivers, such as the <a
href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a> packet processing toolkit, do not need to  
be relinked with new drivers — this is especially helpful when static linking
is utilized.</p>

<p>Implementing virtio in hardware also makes it easy to switch between hardware
and software implementations.  A software device can be substituted without
changing guest drivers if the hardware device is acting up.
Similarly, if the driver is acting up, it is possible to substitute
a software device to make debugging the driver easier.  It is possible to
assign hardware devices to performance-critical guests while assigning software
devices to the other guests; this decision can be changed in the future to
balance resource needs. Finally, implementing virtio in hardware makes it
possible to live-migrate 
virtual machines more easily.  The destination host can have either software or
hardware virtio devices.</p>

<h4>Implementing virtio PCI devices</h4>

<p>Virtio has a number of useful properties for hardware implementers.  Many
device types have optional features so that device implementers can choose a
subset that meets their use case.  These optional features are negotiated
during device initialization for forward and backward compatibility.  This
means hardware devices will continue working with guest drivers even after new
versions of the virtio specification become widespread.  Old guest drivers will
work with newer devices too.</p>

<a href="/Articles/805240/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/kvmf-tsirkin-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="left"

</a>

<p>Historically, virtio was performance-optimized for software
implementations.  They used guest physical addresses instead of PCI bus
addresses that are translated by an IOMMU.  Memory coherency was also assumed
and DMA memory-ordering primitives were therefore unnecessary.  In preparation
for hardware virtio implementations, the <tt>VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM</tt> and
<tt>VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM</tt> feature bits were introduced in
virtio 1.1.  A device
that advertises these feature bits requires a driver that uses bus addresses
and DMA memory-ordering primitives.</p> 

<p>At least three approaches exist for hardware virtio PCI devices: full
offloading, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/achieving-network-wirespeed-open-standard-manner-introducing-vdpa">virtual
data path acceleration</a> (vDPA), and vDPA partitioning.  Full
offloading passes the entire device or a PCI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization">SR-IOV</a> virtual function (VF),
which is a sub-device available on PCI adapters designed for virtualization, to
the guest.  All device accesses are handled in hardware — both those related to
device initialization and to the data-path device operation. In this setup, all
software is completely vendor-independent.</p>

<p>By comparison, vDPA is a hybrid software/hardware approach where a
vendor-specific driver intercepts control path (discovery and initialization)
accesses from the virtio driver and handles them in software, while the data
path is implemented in hardware in a way compliant with the virtio
specification.  Performance is still good since the data path is handled
directly in hardware.</p>

<p>The final approach is vDPA partitioning based on fine-grained memory protection
between guests, such as the PCI process address space ID (PASID), which allow
multiple virtual address spaces for device accesses instead of just one.  This
allows flexible resource allocation because users can configure the host driver
to pass resources to guests as they wish.  PASID support is not yet widespread,
so this approach has not been explored as much as the alternatives.</p>

<p>
Hardware bugs in fully offloaded devices that are not fixable in a
firmware update can be assigned new virtio feature bits.  Workarounds
can be added to generic virtio drivers when these feature bits are
seen.  Hardware vendors can make the device's feature bits
programmable, for example via a firmware update, so that the device
refuses to start if the driver does not support a workaround for a
critical bug.  Bugs in vDPA devices can be worked around in the
vendor's driver.</p>

<h4>Live migration</h4>

<p>Users often wish to move a running guest to another host with
minimal downtime.
When hardware devices are passed through to the guest, this becomes challenging
because saving and restoring device state is not yet widely implemented for
hardware devices.  The details of representing device state are not covered by
the virtio 1.1 specification, so hardware implementers must tackle this issue
themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://qemu.org/">QEMU</a> can help with live-migration
compatibility by locking down the virtio
feature bits that were negotiated on the source host and enforcing them on the
destination host.  This way, live migration ensures the availability of features
that the guest is using.  If the hardware device on the destination does not
support the feature bits currently enabled on the source host, live
migration is not possible.</p>

<p>During live migration, it is necessary to track writes to guest RAM
because RAM
is migrated incrementally in the background while the guest continues to
run on the old host
for a period of time.  If writes are missed, the destination host receives
an outdated and incomplete copy of guest RAM.  Hardware devices must
participate in this process of logging writes.  <a
href="/Articles/805040/">Infrastructure for this</a> is 
expected to land in the VFIO <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/vfio-mediated-device.html">mediated
device</a> (mdev) driver subsystem in the future.</p>

<p>Looking further into the future, both vendor-independent support
for live migration and the
elimination of memory pinning should become possible as IOMMU capabilities
grow.  The new shared virtual addressing (SVA) support in Linux and associated
IOMMU hardware allows devices to access a process address space instead of
using a
dedicated IOMMU page table.  Using unpinned memory would be attractive
because it enables swappable pages and memory overcommit.  In addition, this will
make write logging for live migration simpler because device writes into memory
can cause faults and be tracked in a vendor-independent way.</p>

<p>PCI page request interface (PRI) is the mechanism that allows IOMMU fault
handling, but it might not be sufficient to support post-copy live migration,
where the guest immediately runs on the destination host without prior
migration of guest RAM.  In post-copy live migration, guest RAM is faulted in
from the source host on demand with unpredictable latencies, something that
might not be appropriate for PRI. Virtio might be able to help by standardizing
a way for a device to request a page and to pause and resume request
processing. The out-of-order properties of virtio queues mean that the device can
proceed even as a 
specific request is blocked waiting for a page to be faulted.</p>

<h4>Future optimizations</h4>

<p>Finally, changes can be made to how virtio works to make hardware
implementations faster. The amount of outstanding work available in a queue
needs to be retrieved by 
the device from memory. Pushing this information to the device from the driver
might help devices avoid memory accesses.</p>

<p>Today there exists an interrupt-suppression mechanism called "event index"
that stores the associated state in guest RAM.  Guest RAM accesses require
hardware devices to perform DMA transfers, which can be expensive and waste PCI
bus bandwidth if there have been no changes to RAM.  A more hardware-friendly
mechanism would be welcome here. In a similar vein, interrupt coalescing is
a common technique to reduce CPU 
consumption due to interrupts being raised frequently.  In hardware
implementations it is easy to take advantage of this.</p>

<p>Participation in the
<a
href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=virtio">virtio 
Technical Committee</a>
standardization process is easy and
<a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec/#providing-feedback">open
to anyone</a>.  Hardware
vendors are welcome to participate in order to improve support for their
hardware.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The virtio specification was originally intended for software device
implementations but is now being implemented in hardware devices as well.
Tsirkin's presentation outlined how virtio 1.1 enables hardware implementations
but also identified areas where further work is necessary, for example for
live migration.  Although hardware virtio devices are not common yet, the
interest in hardware implementation from silicon vendors and cloud providers
suggests the day is not far off when these "virtual" devices become
physical.

It sounds like a weird thing to do, but I wouldn't mind seeing this done to PCI at large in the same way USB already has a few generic plug-and-play protocols. I realise USB is still a trash fire in spite of that, but PCI could use a lot of improvement on the software front. We were lucky to even get things like EHCI USB and a single AHCI driver (which my laptop can't even use, because the BIOS deliberately breaks it…)<br>

<p>
IIUC I'd agree more with the previous comment - it's like USB classes, at least in the first case.  You end up designing hardware to match the virtio class and there's no extra driver code.  Like the way there's a single driver that handles any class-compliant usb-audio device.  To me that's the inverse of a HAL.<br>

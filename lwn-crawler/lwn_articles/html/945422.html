           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 2, 2023</br>
           </div>
In <a href="/Articles/944686/">last week's episode</a>, a need to preempt
kernel code that is executing long-running instructions led to a deeper
reexamination of how the kernel handles preemption.  There are a number of
supported preemption modes, varying from "none" (kernel code is never
preemptible) to realtime (where the kernel is almost always preemptible).
Making better use of the kernel's preemption machinery looked like a
possible solution to the immediate problem, but it seems that there are
better options in store.  In short, kernel developers would like to give
the scheduler complete control over CPU-scheduling decisions.
<p>
<h4>How we got here</h4>
<p>
The turn in the discussion was driven by <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87cyyfxd4k.ffs@tglx/">this message</a> from Thomas
Gleixner, which started with a review of how things got to this point.
Initially, no preemption of kernel code was supported at all, as was the
case with older Unix systems.  As problems were observed,
<tt>cond_resched()</tt> calls were sprinkled into code paths where the
kernel was observed to (or suspected of) running for too long and causing
problems.  Each of those calls is a signal to the scheduler that it can
switch to another thread if need be.
<p>
Later, the kernel gained "voluntary preemption", which turned hundreds of
existing <tt>might_sleep()</tt> calls into additional scheduling points.
Those calls were placed as a debugging aid to catch cases where a
potentially sleeping function was called from a non-sleepable context; they
indicate a place where it is possible to reschedule, but were never meant
to indicate a <i>good</i> place to reschedule.  These calls were pressed
into service because they were already there and convenient for this
purpose.
<p>
Later yet, full preemption made the kernel preemptible at arbitrary points,
and realtime preemption made even (most) code holding locks preemptible.
<p>
This progression is, Gleixner said, an example of the wrong way to be
approaching this problem:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The approach here is: Prevent the scheduler to make decisions and then
	mitigate the fallout with heuristics.
<p>
	That's just backwards as it moves resource control out of the
	scheduler into random code which has absolutely no business to do
	resource control.
</blockquote>
<p>
He pointed out that the realtime preemption work had run into a similar
problem years ago.  Making kernel code preemptible, even when it is holding
locks, can be good for latency (which is the point of the realtime work),
but it can impose a cost in terms of throughput.  When preemption can
happen at any time, locking contention, in particular, becomes more acute.
Often, one thread will cause another to become runnable, at which point the
new thread will preempt the first.  But if the first is holding a lock that
the new one needs, the result will be an immediate block and another
context switch.  That hurts performance.
<p>
In such cases, it would be better to avoid doing the preemption while the
first thread is holding the lock.  For the realtime case, this was solved
through the introduction of <a
href="https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel/+/refs/tags/v5.9.1-rt20-patches/patches/preempt-lazy-support.patch">"lazy
preemption"</a>.  This code, which has not landed in the mainline kernel,
seeks to avoid excessive preemption when (and only when) one non-realtime
task would preempt another.  If the task that is currently running is
holding locks, then the scheduler will set a "lazy preempt" flag rather
than preempting that task immediately.  Once the locks are released, the
preemption can occur.  This change restored much of the performance that
had been lost for throughput-oriented tasks, Gleixner said, without hurting
response time for the realtime tasks.
<p>
The problem that is being discussed now is similar: enabling a fully
preemptible kernel without hurting the performance of throughput-oriented
tasks, many of which do better with voluntary preemption (or no kernel
preemption at all).  The solution, Gleixner said, can be a variant of the
same approach that was taken for the realtime work.
<p>
<h4>Lazy preemption for the mainline</h4>
<p>
Some brief background may be helpful for the understanding of the proposed
scheme.  When the kernel is configured for full preemption, it maintains a
"preemption count" that, in short, tracks how many things are preventing
preemption of the current task at any time.  Its operation is described in
<a href="/Articles/831678/">this article</a>, which includes this
diagram:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2020/preempt-count.svg" class="photo"
width=450px alt="[preempt_count]" border=0>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whenever something happens to prevent preemption, such as a call to
<tt>preempt_disable()</tt> or the arrival of an interrupt, the appropriate
subfield of the preemption count is incremented.  When that condition no
longer holds — <tt>preempt_enable()</tt> is called, for example — that
count is decremented.  Whenever the count drops to zero, the kernel knows
that it can jump into the scheduler to decide which task has the strongest
claim on the CPU at that moment.
<p>
Calling into the scheduler is expensive, though, so it is best avoided if
there is no need to change the running task.  Avoiding those calls is the
purpose of the "reschedule needed" bit.  That bit has an inverted sense; if
it is set, then rescheduling is <i>not</i> needed.  As long as that bit is
set, the preempt count will not be zero, and no calls into the scheduler
will be made.  When something happens that calls for rescheduling, such as
waking a higher-priority task, the bit can be cleared and, as soon as the
rest of the count drops to zero, the scheduler will be invoked.
<p>
In a non-preemptive kernel, about the only thing that can force
rescheduling is the expiration of the current task's time slice.  This
behavior can be good for a throughput-oriented workload, allowing tasks to
run uninterrupted for relatively long periods of time.  There are limits,
though, and letting tasks run beyond their time slice can lead to latency
problems.  Long-running kernel code can cause that to happen; avoiding this
problem is the motivation for placing calls to <tt>cond_resched()</tt> in
long-running kernel functions.  Since the kernel cannot be preempted, it
must choose to give up the CPU in such situations.
<p>
Gliexner's proposal is meant to preserve this behavior in a fully
preemptible kernel.  In this world, the existing no-preemption and
voluntary-preemption modes would be removed from the scheduler; only full
preemption would remain.  The maintenance of the preempt count would happen
always, as it does with the <tt>PREEMPT_DYNAMIC</tt> mode used by most
distributions now.  But there would be one little tweak: if the system is
configured to favor throughput, code paths that would normally clear the
"reschedule needed" bit would only do so if the current time slice is
exhausted.  Otherwise, a separate "reschedule eventually" bit, that is not
contained within the preempt count, would be set instead.
<p>
This change will cause the current task to continue executing for as long
as it has some of its time slice left, even if there is another task with
the priority to preempt it.  There are just a couple of places where that
can change; one is on return to user space from a system call, where
preemption can occur even in current no-preemption kernels.  The
"reschedule eventually" bit will be checked there, and might result in a
switch to a different task.
<p>
The other point where a task might be preempted is when the scheduler
interrupt happens; if the scheduler notices that the time slice has
expired, it will check the "reschedule eventually" bit.  If that bit is
set, then the "reschedule needed" bit will be cleared, the preempt count
will go to zero, and preemption will happen at the next opportunity.
<p>
If, instead, the system is configured for low latency, as might be done for
desktop use, for example, the "reschedule eventually" bit will not be used
and the kernel will be fully preemptible.
<p>
Reworking the scheduler in this way, Gleixner said, would allow the removal
of a lot of code that implements the other preemption modes (and which,
seemingly, is not heavily used).  It would allow the removal of something
like 1,400 <tt>cond_resched()</tt> calls, and would put the scheduler fully
in charge of CPU-scheduling decisions.  If this solution can be made to
work, it looks like a significant improvement over what the kernel does
now.
<p>
<h4>Making it work</h4>
<p>
Can it be made to work?  Gleixner, after having bashed out a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/8734z8v1lo.ffs@tglx/">proof-of-concept
implementation</a> and measured its performance, thinks so: "<q>If this
concept holds, which I'm pretty convinced of by now, then this is an
opportunity to trade ~3000 lines of unholy hacks for about 100-200 lines of
understandable code</q>".  Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wix=nrfi2LkSXBvBSrTHgEAMYQebUfWXq8Q-PtH0x_SdQ@mail.gmail.com/">agreed</a>:
"<q>I think you more than proved the concept</q>".
<p>
There is, of course, some ground to cover between a proof-of-concept
implementation and a reworked scheduler that can be part of a production
kernel release.  A couple of obstacles (at least) lie in the way.  One is
that there are four architectures (alpha, hexagon, m68k, and um (user-mode
Linux)) that do not support the preempt-count machinery; as things stand,
they would be unable to support the new scheduler.  Matthew Wilcox was
quick to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZQmbhoQIINs8rLHp@casper.infradead.org/">suggest</a>
that this problem qualifies those architectures for removal, but there is
probably not much in the way of adding preempt-count support instead.
<p>
The other problem is that the CPU scheduler is a subtle and complex beast,
and Gleixner is not actually a scheduler developer.  There will surely be
performance issues that will emerge from a change like this, and they will
require the right sorts of skills to resolve.  Gleixner has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87jzshhexi.ffs@tglx/">let it be known</a> that he is
not the person with those skills:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	That's as much as I wanted to demonstrate and I'm not going to
	spend more cycles on it as I have already too many other things on
	flight and the resulting scheduler woes are clearly outside of my
	expertise.
<p>
	Though definitely I'm putting a permanent NAK in place for any
	attempts to duct tape the preempt=NONE model any further by
	sprinkling more cond*() and whatever warts around.
</blockquote>
<p>
So, in other words, the path to a simpler and better scheduler has been
laid out, but to get there somebody else is going to have to do the work to
push the job through to completion.  As of this writing, nobody has stepped
forward to take this role.  That will likely change, but one should not
expect to see a reworked scheduler in the immediate future; this is the
kind of change that can take a while to settle into a stable solution.
When that happens, though, the payoff should be significant.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is a no-brainer improvement in my book. The model we currently have where a task is considered non-preemptible by default for CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE or CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY, rather than requiring it to communicate to the scheduler when it should try (keyword "try") to avoid being preempted, is fundamentally backwards and error prone. It's why we see the never-ending stream of "add cond_resched() call to avoid hogging CPU" patches flowing by. If it's a bug if we don't have a cond_resched() somewhere that would otherwise hog a core and starve important kthreads like ksoftirqd, then let's just flip the polarity and force callers to specify when they want the scheduler to try to avoid preemption for performance reasons.<br>

If my reading of the thread is correct, particularly this message by Ingo Molnar: <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/ZQlV5l4pbKunQJug@gmail.com/">https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/ZQlV5l4pbKunQJug@gmail.com/</a>  there wouldn't even be a need for some runtime/compile time knob to select between throughput-oriented and low-latency system modes as described in the article. But rather the lazy preemption would apply only to SCHED_OTHER (and IDLE and BATCH, not that I've ever seen anything use those) tasks with identical nice values, whereas higher priority tasks would preempt ASAP. So best of both worlds, in a sense.<br>

It feels like it would be possible to go a step further, and have tasks designated as latency-sensitive or throughput-sensitive, and have only latency-sensitive tasks preempt other tasks (and make them expend their time slice faster if they do). The system could then be configured to make tasks default to latency or throughput, but also able to give different tasks at the same priority different benefits.<br>

An obvious way to perform such designations is via the deadline scheduler.   The fact that deadline scheduling is scarcely mentioned in discussions like this article confirms the suspicion that it is usable only in a limited set of contexts.   Perhaps deadline scheduling is really only workable for RTOSes or systems with fewer tasks, like guest OSes running on top of a hypervisor.<br>

For those who weren't at Kernel Recipes last week, Thomas gave a great presentation about this work there. The recording is available on YouTube and complements the article nicely:<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt;  So, in other words, the path to a simpler and better scheduler has been laid out, but to get there somebody else is going to have to do the work to push the job through to completion. </span><br>
<p>
Working on a RFC series to do just that. Thomas' approach (obviously) works, but as always there are kinks to clean up.<br>
<p>
cond_resched(), in particular, has accumulated a variety of functionality almost in the manner of the fleas in the poem:<br>
<p>
  "Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em, <br>
   And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum."<br>
<p>
As you note, keeping the preempt-count takes care of much of this but there are some tricky places, in particular RCU.<br>

On RCU, indeed!  It is very important to provide the occasional quiescent state to RCU, even if there is only one runnable task on the CPU in question. <br>
<p>
I was initially concern about nohz_full CPUs, but after more discussion with Frederic, this might actually be OK. If there is an RCU grace period in progress, RCU will restart the scheduler tick interrupt, otherwise maybe no one cares. Maybe. ;-)<br>

      There was a version of the lazy preemption patches posted in May.  Since then I've seen bits of conversation that suggest that the idea is still alive, but I'm not sure how actively it is being developed at the moment.

<p>
In the filesystem track of the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Amir Goldstein led a session on using
<a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/filesystem-monitoring.html">fanotify</a>
for <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_storage_management">hierarchical
storage management</a> (HSM). Linux had some support for HSM in the XFS
filesystem's implementation of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMAPI">data management API</a> (DMAPI),
but that code was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=288699fecaffa1ef8f75f92020cbb593a772e487">removed</a>
back in&nbsp;2010.  Goldstein has done some work 
on using fanotify for HSM features, but he has run into some problems with
deadlocks that he wanted to discuss with attendees.
</p>

<p>
He began by pointing to a <a
href="https://github.com/amir73il/fsnotify-utils/wiki/Hierarchical-Storage-Management-API">wiki
page</a> he created to describe HSM and his goals for using fanotify to
support it.
His employer is CTERA Networks, which builds "cloud gateway solutions",
where files appear to be 
available on the local system even though they may be cached on a local
network-attached storage (NAS) device or stored somewhere else in the
cloud.  The 
NAS might not have space to accommodate all of the data, but it functions as
a (more) local cache.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Windows has an API for HSM, so files have a status that reflects their
location; users can decide if they want to access a file if, for example,
it will require a lengthy copy from the cloud.  This HSM support is based on
"<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/reparse-points">reparse
points</a>" in NTFS; when those are encountered, another filesystem driver
is called to provide the file data.  There is nothing like that in Linux,
so those who provide that functionality have to implement their own scheme;
CTERA uses <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html">FUSE</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The FUSE solution comes with various kinds of problems and he hopes that
some of the alternatives being discussed at LSFMM+BPF will help alleviate
them.  DMAPI is an old API, which is insufficient for today's HSM needs,
though the code from XFS still exists if there is anything useful in it;
remnants 
of it are still present in Linux, as the "punch hole" interface was added
for DMAPI.  When the DMAPI hooks were removed, there was a comment
suggesting that "at least the namespace events can be done much saner in
the VFS", which is what Goldstein is trying to do now.
</p>

<p>
He showed that a simple HSM can be implemented using the existing upstream
fanotify 
API.  It could use sparse files to represent the data that is not
local. It does so by first getting an exclusive lock on the file object
using <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html"><tt>fcntl(fd,&nbsp;F_SETLEASE,&nbsp;F_WRLCK)</tt></a>,
migrating the content elsewhere, and then punching a hole
in the file using <tt>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE</tt> to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html"><tt>fallocate()</tt></a>.
The HSM service can subscribe to various types of fanotify events in order
to be notified when the content, permissions, or directory entry of the
file is changed; the cloud version can then be updated as needed. "It is
very naive, but it works." 
</p>

<p>
However, it is not practical for today's use.  For example, users have to
download their entire movie, say, before starting to watch it.  He has a
patch set to add some features to fanotify that would make it more usable
as an HSM, which he posted (as a pointer to his Git tree) in an
<a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAOQ4uxhrQ7hySTyHM0Atq=uzbNdHyGV5wfadJarhAu1jDFOUTg@mail.gmail.com/">email</a>
back in September&nbsp;2022.  The resulting thread eventually led to the
session at the summit.
</p>

<p>
The changes are small, he said, simply adding a few more fanotify event
types (or additional information to existing events), which would
facilitate the HSM use case. They are described further in a <a
href="https://github.com/amir73il/fsnotify-utils/wiki/Hierarchical-Storage-Management-API#new-fanotify-events-and-information">section
of the wiki page</a> and would allow features like populating directories
on demand, streaming downloads of large files, and crash-safe change
tracking.  He has been working on change tracking for a number of years now in
various guises; he has an internal solution, but would like to get
something into the mainline.
</p>

<p>
He described a demo that he did not have time to actually perform, which
can be seen in slide&nbsp;6 of his <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1owJpX1rlXyXGchp3ioq-36VXcILDDoDZGpiYjm8ADEc/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>; it
was based on the <a
href="https://github.com/fangfufu/httpdirfs">HTTPDirFS</a> FUSE filesystem,
which allows read-only mounts of a directory accessed via HTTP.  Goldstein
modified it 
to use fanotify on a kernel with his patches.  It would allow him to mount
the kernel.org <tt>/pub</tt> directory locally, then access a
 file deep in the directory hierarchy.  The filesystem
lazily populates the needed directories into the local directory where it
is mounted.
The mount point is no longer a FUSE mount in that mode, but is a bind mount
instead, with fanotify events being monitored.  He displayed an example
command that would display the first few lines of a <tt>tar</tt> table of
contents of a large file.  Only the first 1MB of the file would be
transferred before the command completed, rather
than waiting for the entire contents.
</p>

<p>
He had two more slides after the "demo" slide, which were increasingly
complex, he said.  They were an attempt to explain some problems that he has
found, "in order to try to sell the solution".  At one time, there was a
problem with the 
original fanotify API where an operation caused a <tt>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</tt>
event, which might require the fanotify service to access the file; that
results in a 
second (blocking) <tt>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</tt> event which leads to a
user-space deadlock.  That was solved by adding a special file
descriptor that can be used by the service to perform actions without
triggering another fanotify event.
</p>

<p>
But now there is another deadlock that can happen with the existing API; it is
perhaps rare, but it can happen and he is surprised that it has not been
reported. It involves a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ficlonerange.2.html">clone
file range operation</a>, which <a
href="https://archive.kernel.org/oldlinux/htmldocs/filesystems/API-freeze-super.html">takes
the superblock freeze lock</a>, but it may cause the HSM (or other
fanotify-based) 
service to also need to freeze-lock the superblock.  If the files are on the
same filesystem (thus share the same
superblock), a deadlock will result.
</p>

<p>
This deadlock is perhaps more common in his HSM service than in other types
of fanotify-based scanners (e.g. virus scanners).  He has solved it by
using a new event flag (<tt>FAN_PRE_VFS</tt>) that gets added to
<tt>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</tt> events if the freeze lock  has
not been taken.  He then went through and added that flag in the places
where it was true, which involved calling the notify hook in some new
places. That gives the service an opportunity to fill the file before the
clone file range operation freezes the superblock.  That was his solution,
which was not hard to do, Goldstein said.
</p>

<p>
He moved on to the second even-more-complicated slide, which covered a
similar kind of deadlock, but it could also result in a race condition that
would cause his HSM to miss filesystem changes at times.  The scenario was
well beyond my ability to follow it, but a video of the session should be
available before long.  His solution to the problem, which was suggested by
Jan Kara, was to use <a href="/Articles/202847/">sleepable RCU</a>, which
would avoid the race at the cost 
of an occasional false-positive change notification. 
</p> 

<p>
Once attendees seemed
to get up to speed on the problem (and proposed solution), the session ran
out of time, though discussion spilled over into the next slot.  Josef
Bacik said that he did not hate the solution that had been chosen, though
he did not love it either.  Kara explained why sleepable RCU was chosen, and
Goldstein thought that the general idea could be applied to other
filesystem-related 
ordering 
problems (such as when an inode's <tt>i_version</tt> field gets
incremented).

<p>
That isn't how tar works.  It does not have a table of contents at the start of the file.  zip and dar do, but with tar, every file metadata record is immediately followed by its data.  To list the files in the tar, the entire tar file must be read.<br>

I don't know anything about the tar format, but the "demo" was to show the first few entries in the tar file.  Given what you said about the format of tar, that would seem plausible from reading the first MB of the tar file (if the first few entries were contained in that chunk of the file).<br>

      <p>The command didn't list all the files in the tar, though, just the first few. If I have thousands of small files in a tar, each under 4 KiB in size, then reading the first 1 MiB of the file is enough to list the first 256 files; if my command is `tar tf file.tar | head -n 3`, then I'm not going to read much more than 1 MiB before tar gets SIGPIPE from head, and shuts down.

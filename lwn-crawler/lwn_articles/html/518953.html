<p>If you run a post-3.6 Linux kernel for long enough,
you will likely see a process named <code>rcu_sched</code> or
<code>rcu_preempt</code> or maybe even <code>rcu_bh</code> having
consumed significant CPU time.
If the system goes idle and all application processes exit,
these processes might well have the largest CPU consumption of
all the remaining processes.
It is only natural to ask &ldquo;what are these processes and why
are they consuming so much CPU?&rdquo;

<p>The &ldquo;what&rdquo; part is easy: These are new kernel threads
that handle RCU grace periods, previously handled mainly in
softirq context.
An &ldquo;RCU grace period&rdquo; is a period of time after which
all pre-existing RCU read-side critical sections have completed,
so that if an RCU updater
removes a data element from an RCU-protected data structure and then
waits for an RCU grace period, it may subsequently safely carry out
destructive-to-readers actions, such as freeing the data element.
RCU read-side critical sections begin with <code>rcu_read_lock()</code>
and end with <code>rcu_read_unlock()</code>.
Updaters can wait for an RCU grace period using <code>synchronize_rcu()</code>,
or they can asynchronously schedule a function to be invoked after
a grace period using <code>call_rcu()</code>.
RCU's read-side primitives are extremely fast and scalable, so it
can be quite helpful in read-mostly situations.
For more detail on RCU, see: 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/418853/">The RCU API, 2010 Edition</a>,
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/262464/">What is RCU, Fundamentally?</a>,

Why would latency be reduced by moving RCU work to a kthread?
And why would anyone care about latency on huge machines?
<br><a href="#qq1answer">Answer</a>
</div>

<p>The reason for moving RCU grace-period handling to a kernel thread
was to improve real-time latency (both interrupt latency and
scheduling latency) on huge systems by allowing RCU's
grace-period initialization to be preempted:
Without preemption, this initialization can inflict
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/517647/">more than 200 microseconds of latency</a>
on huge systems.
In addition, this change will very likely also improve
RCU's energy efficiency while also simplifying the code.
These potential simplifications are due to the fact that kernel threads
make it easier to guarantee forward progress, avoiding hangs in
cases where
all CPUs are asleep and thus ignoring the current grace period,
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/22/124">as confirmed by Paul Walmsley</a>.
But the key point here is that these kernel threads do not represent
new overhead: Instead, overhead that used to be hidden in softirq
context is now visible in kthread context.

Wow!!!  If <code>hackbench</code> does a million grace periods in ten minutes,
just how many does something like <code>rcutorture</code> do?
<br><a href="#qq2answer">Answer</a>
</div>

<p>Now for &ldquo;why so much CPU?&rdquo;, which is the question
Ingo Molnar asked immediately upon seeing more than three minutes of
CPU time consumed by
<code>rcu_sched</code> after running a couple hours of kernel builds.
The answer is that Linux makes heavy use of RCU, so much so that
running <code>hackbench</code> for ten minutes can result in almost
one million RCU grace periods&mdash;and more than thirty seconds
of CPU time consumed by <code>rcu_sched</code>.
This works out to about thirty microseconds per grace period, which
is anything but excessive, considering the amount of work that grace
periods do.

<p>As it turns out, the CPU consumption
of <code>rcu_sched</code>, <code>rcu_preempt</code>, and
<code>rcu_bh</code>
is often roughly equal to the sum of that of the <code>ksoftirqd</code>
threads.
Interestingly enough, in 3.6 and earlier, some of the RCU grace-period overhead
would have been charged to the <code>ksoftirqd</code> kernel threads.

<p>But CPU overhead per grace period is only part of the story.
RCU works hard to process multiple updates (e.g., <code>call_rcu()</code>
or <code>synchronize_rcu()</code> invocations) with a single grace period.
It is not hard to achieve more than one hundred updates per grace
period, which results in a per-update overhead of only about 300 nanoseconds,
which is not bad at all.
Furthermore, workloads having well in excess of one thousand updates
per grace period
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/2004-usenix-annual-technical-conference/making-rcu-safe-deep-sub-millisecond-response">have been observed</a>.

<p>Of course, the per-grace-period CPU overhead does vary, and
with it the per-update overhead.
First, the greater the number of possible CPUs
(as given at boot time by <code>nr_cpu_ids</code>),
the more work RCU must do when initializing and cleaning up grace periods.
This overhead grows fairly slowly, with additional work required
with the addition of each set of 16 CPUs, though this number varies
depending on the
<code>CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_LEAF</code> kernel configuration parameter
and also on the <code>rcutree.rcu_fanout_leaf</code> kernel boot parameter.
<p>
Second, the greater the number of idle CPUs, the more work RCU must
do when forcing quiescent states.
Yes, the busier the system, the less work RCU needs to do!
The reason for the extra work is that RCU is not permitted to disturb
idle CPUs for energy-efficiency reasons.
RCU must therefore probe a per-CPU data structure to read out idleness
state during each grace period, likely incurring a cache miss on each such
probe.
<p>
Third and finally, the overhead will vary depending on CPU clock rate,
memory-system performance, virtualization overheads, and so on.
All that aside, I see per-grace-period overheads ranging from 15 to
100 microseconds on the systems I use.
I suspect that a system with thousands of CPUs might consume many
hundreds of microseconds, or perhaps even milliseconds, of CPU time
for each grace period.
On the other hand, such a system might also handle a very large number
of updates per grace period.

<div class="tlr"><a name="Quick Quiz 3"><b>Quick Quiz 3</b>:</a>
Now that all of the RCU overhead is appearing
on the <code>rcu_sched</code>, <code>rcu_preempt</code>, and
<code>rcu_bh</code> kernel threads, we should be able to more
easily identify that overhead and optimize RCU, right?
<br><a href="#qq3answer">Answer</a>
</div>
<p>In conclusion, the <code>rcu_sched</code>, <code>rcu_preempt</code>, and
<code>rcu_bh</code> CPU overheads should not be anything to worry about.
They do not represent new overhead inflicted on post-3.6 kernels,
but rather better accounting of the
same overhead that RCU has been incurring all along.

<p><b>Quick Quiz 1</b>:
Why would latency be reduced by moving RCU work to a kthread?
And why would anyone care about latency on huge machines?


</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Moving work from softirq to a kthread allows that work to be more
easily preempted, and this preemption reduces scheduling latency.
Low scheduling latency is of course important in real-time applications,
but it also helps reduce
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/514778/">OS jitter</a>.
Low OS jitter is critically important to certain types of
high-performance-computing (HPC) workloads, which is the type
of workload that tends to be run on huge systems.

<p><b>Quick Quiz 2</b>:
Wow!!!  If <code>hackbench</code> does a million grace periods in ten minutes,
just how many does something like <code>rcutorture</code> do?


</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Actually, <code>rcutorture</code> tortures RCU in many different ways,
including overly long read-side critical sections, transitions to and
from idle, and CPU hotplug operations.
Thus, a typical <code>rcutorture</code> run would probably &ldquo;only&rdquo;
do about 100,000 grace periods in a ten-minute interval.

<p>In short, the grace-period rate can vary widely depending on your
hardware, kernel configuration, and workload.

</p><p><b>Answer</b>:
Yes and no.
Yes, it is easier to optimize that which can be easily measured.
But no, not all of RCU's overhead appears on the
<code>rcu_sched</code>, <code>rcu_preempt</code>, and
<code>rcu_bh</code> kernel threads.
Some of it still appears on the <code>ksoftirqd</code> kernel
threads, and some of it is spread over other tasks.

<p>Still, yes, the greater visibility should be helpful.

There is one thread for each flavor of RCU, which means three on CONFIG_PREEMPT=y kernels (rcu_bh, rcu_preempt, and rcu_sched) and two on CONFIG_PREEMPT=n kernels (rcu_bh and rcu_sched, with rcu_preempt mapping onto rcu_sched).<br>

In theory, a single thread could handle all the RCU flavors, but when I tried this the code got quite ugly.<br>

      Given that the bug seems to have happened on a 3.2 kernel, I suspect that the kthreading is not responsible.  ;-)

<p>But here are some commits that have fixed RCU-related CPU stall warning issues in reverse chronological order:

<pre>
c96ea7cf: rcu: Avoid spurious RCU CPU stall warnings *
c8020a67: rcu: Protect rcu_node accesses during CPU stall warnings
5fd4dc06: rcu: Avoid rcu_print_detail_task_stall_rnp() segfault
a10d206e: rcu: Fix day-one dyntick-idle stall-warning bug *
1c17e4d4: rcu: Prevent uninitialized string in RCU CPU stall info
13cfcca0: rcu: Set RCU CPU stall times via sysfs
2d1dc9a6: rcu: Remove redundant rcu_cpu_stall_suppress declaration
</pre>

The two commits marked with &ldquo;*&rdquo; are the most likely to address this bug.

<h1>Parallel IDE drivers</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted September 5, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Back in 2003, Jeff Garzik <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/33624/">announced</a> the availability of "a
new SCSI driver."  That driver was, in fact, the libata subsystem, which
was to be the foundation for serial ATA support in Linux.  In the process,
however, Jeff had thought a bit about supporting the current parallel ATA
(PATA) drives, but that was not really his goal:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Note that PATA in my driver is only an afterthought.  The main area
	of focus, now and in the future, is SATA.
</div>
<p>
In the last three years, the parallel ATA drives that most of us use have
continued to be driven by the old IDE driver subsystem.  Some of this code
dates back to the beginning of Linux; since then it has been maintained by
a substantial list of people, a number of whom are widely held to have been
driven insane by the experience.  The current maintainer, Bartlomiej
Zolnierkiewicz, has kept a rather low profile for some time now; he
signed off no patches in either of the 2.6.17 or upcoming 2.6.18 kernels.
Not much has been happening in the IDE area.
<p>
That does not mean that things have been quiet in the parallel ATA area,
however.  Over the last year or so, Alan Cox has been working to bring full
PATA support into the libata code.  The resulting drivers have been sitting
in the -mm tree for a while, but that period is about to end: the PATA
driver set <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/198168/">has been queued for
merging into 2.6.19</a>.
<p>
The stated advantages of the new PATA code are many.  The code has been
reworked from the beginning, and is up to current kernel standards.  The
use of libata means that these drivers are well integrated with their SATA
cousins, bringing two divergent subsystems back together.  The new drivers
support a number of chipsets that the IDE layer doesn't handle.  Error
handling has been much improved.  Also, according to <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/194866/">Alan's announcement</a> from August,
the new drivers feature "active maintenance and updates" and "more
interesting bugs to find and help fix."
<p>
On the other hand, the new PATA drivers are not considered to be ready for
production use yet, and distributors are not expected to enable them in the
near future.  The merging into 2.6.19 is intended mainly to broaden the
test base.  A completely new disk subsystem is the sort of thing that one
likes to test very well before entrusting it with data that one wishes to
actually keep; that process may go on for a little while yet.  It is also
worth noting that the new PATA code also drops support for some ancient IDE
controllers.
<p>

The issue that gets everybody's attention, however, is that, as with all
drives handled through libata, PATA drives show up as if they were SCSI
disks, and are named <tt>/dev/sd*</tt>.  Anybody who just switches to the
new drivers without updating <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> (or using the
mount-by-label feature) is likely to have a rough bootstrap experience. 
That is an easy problem to work around, but the use of the SCSI drive
namespace seems to bother some people.  What appears to be happening in
reality is that Linux is slowly moving toward having a generic disk
subsystem, where everything can just be called <tt>/dev/diskN</tt>.  All
that's left is a few details and a new set of udev rules to rename the
device nodes.
<p>
Someday, most of us will be using the new PATA code.  But this is not a
process which is expected to go quickly, and there are no plans to remove
or deprecate the existing IDE code:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	At this point in time it is premature to discuss or plan the point
	at which the old IDE layer would go away. That discussion can start
	at the point where everyone is happy that the new libata based
	layer is providing better quality and coverage than the old
	one. Even then there would be no need to hurry.
</div>
<p>
So it appears that Linux will have parallel subsystems for parallel ATA
support for some time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Last time I checked, hdparm could not send much commands to 'SCSI' hard 
disk - in my case a USB-attached IDE hard disk -, and especially could not 
spin it down. Is that sorted now? Or does the [slow] move to libata remove 
some power management features?

      I believe this is a limitation of USB mass storage devices--similar to how you can't run smartctl on them. You might be able to do a few things with sdparm that you couldn't with hdparm, however--since they are 'SCSI' devices, after all.<br>

      sdparm is FAR less mature than hdparm, and in many cases is essentially a <br>
read-only interface (like hdparm -i/-I).  That doesn't seem to be changing <br>
very fast, either.  OTOH, hdparm is slowly but surely developing <br>
additional general SCSI and libATA specific capacities.  The biggest <br>
holdup initially was that libATA didn't support pass-thru of the needed <br>
ATA command set, so hdparm couldn't get the necessary commands thru to the <br>
hardware or the necessary results back from the hardware, but that seems <br>
to be changing with the latest kernels (2.6.17-rcX+, AFAIK).  Apparently, <br>
hdparm has actually had the ability to send the commands to libATA for <br>
some time and was only waiting on libATA to pass them thru, so the hdparm <br>
actually working functionality has been "magically" improving with the <br>
latest kernels, even without new versions of hdparm.<br>
<p>
One can therefore come to a relatively safe conclusion that hdparm will <br>
continue to function more or less as it always has, possibly with no <br>
actual user visible changes at all, as libATA capacities in regard to PATA <br>
hardware improve.<br>
<p>
Of course, the other big issue is that the traditional IDE interface has <br>
allowed for 63 partitions, while SCSI has only allowed for 15.  On my last <br>
PATA drive I had some 20-plus partitions, some of which were backup images <br>
of others.  Fortunately, I saw mention of fact that the 15 partition SCSI <br>
limit applied to libATA SATA drives as well, before I tried switching <br>
over, so I wasn't caught unaware and was able to prepare.  However, there <br>
will likely be those for whom it's a problem.  <br>
<p>
(As it happened, by the time I actually switched to SATA, I had decided to <br>
go quad SATA drive kernel RAID, RAID-1 boot, partitioned RAID-6 main <br>
system, RAID-0 for temporary and recacheable/redownloadable data.  On the <br>
RAID-6, I ran three partitions, root, root-bak, and a third partition <br>
overlaid with LVM2, which contained most of my former partitions as LVM2 <br>
logical volumes, so I didn't run into the issue.  However, had I not seen <br>
the warning about the 15 partition limit on SCSI including libATA, I <br>
likely would have switched to SATA earlier and would have run into the <br>
issue, so yes, it's a very real one for some people.)<br>
<p>
Maybe the libATA PATA work bypasses the 15-partition SCSI limit some way?  <br>
I'd certainly be nice if it did for those not running RAID or LVM, given <br>
the half-terabyte and larger drives we are seeing now.<br>

      I think one of the best things about this is retirement of "ide" as a misnomer for ATA (PATA) devices, at least in one place.
<p>
For those not familiar with the naming mixup: "IDE" is a technology that is used in <em>all</em> modern disk drives, including SCSI.  The first IDE drives used the protocol called ATA (now sometimes PATA), and the names got mixed up.

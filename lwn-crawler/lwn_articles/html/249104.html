LWN.net <a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2007/">Kernel Summit 2007</a> coverage
</div>
<p>
James Bottomley started off the session on developer relations by pointing
at Greg Kroah-Hartman's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/240418/">2.6.22
developers poster</a> which was hanging in the back of the room and stating
that the 900+ developers listed there were not anywhere near enough.  If
Linux is to continue to grow and stay healthy, we need to bring in many
more developers.  There are, he says, a couple of ways of doing that.  By
simply increasing the user base we should increase our developer base as
well; some small percentage of Linux users will eventually start to hack on
the system.  The other way is to stop discouraging developers and pushing
them out of the community.  The latter topic took up most of this session.
<p>

Flaming and generally unpleasant behavior remain a problem in the kernel
community.  Whenever one developer flames another - for something trivial
like whitespace violations or something more substantial - he sets an
example for others.  The original developer may feel justified in the
flaming by being "right," but those who follow may be less right while
being just 
as inflammatory.  The result is flaming by people who have never considered
sending in a kernel patch.  We are, says James, attracting idiots to our
community by our behavior.
<p>

We are also making it harder to recruit developers.  Every flame can
only be discouraging for all of those potential developers who are lurking
on the sidelines and thinking about joining in.  Flaming creates an
unwelcoming environment and works against our
interests in a big way.
<p>

There was a brief discussion of filtering linux-kernel posts by the number
of patches the author has committed.  Or at least marking posts with that
information. 
It was noted that such a policy would make it hard for users to submit bug
reports.  But, more to the point, the application of technical measures to
a social problem like this one is unlikely to help a whole lot.  So this
discussion did not go very far.
<p>

What could help would be for the leaders in the kernel community, many of
whom were at the summit, to show their leadership in their behavior on the
lists.  Try to encourage people doing good things, especially if those
people have been hit by flames from other directions.  Gently discourage
people who are seen to be attacking others.  And, in general, work toward a
better environment on our mailing lists.
<p>

Incendiary email can be especially problematic for developers from some
parts of the world where people simply do not talk to each other that way,
especially in professional settings.  In some cultures, being flamed on a
mailing list can lead to career problems.  If we want to encourage
worldwide participation - and we do - we need to avoid creating problems
for people who are unused to this sort of discourse.
<p>

There are a lot of things which can be done to help in this regard beyond
the simple avoidance of flaming.  Starting a patch review with a "thank
you" and some encouraging comments can work wonders.  It was noted that all
of this has little to do with specific cultures - it's just basic
politeness that will make the process work better for everybody.
<p>

Andrew Morton then took the podium to lead a session on the development
process in general.  He had a number of issues which were relevant to him
in particular.  For example, when a subsystem tree which he pulls into -mm
is merged into the mainline, he would like the maintainer to update the
tree so that there will not be merge conflicts for him to deal with.
<p>

At the 2006 kernel summit, it was agreed that subsystem maintainers would
send out a note sometime around the end of the development cycle describing
what they planned to merge once the next cycle opened up.  Very few
maintainers have been doing that.  Andrew still thinks it is a good idea,
and has asked that people give it a try.  Since then, a number of these
notices have been posted to the mailing lists.
<p>

There was some discussion about how the process should work when there are
very large, cross-subsystem patches to be merged.  An example would be the
upcoming i386/x86_64 merger.  Andrew prefers to merge these patches right
at the end of the merge window, perhaps after -rc1 has come out.  That
minimizes the number of conflicts with all of the other patches.
<p>

In each development cycle, something like 20% of the patches go into the
mainline directly from -mm rather than coming from a subsystem tree.
Andrew says he prefers to merge those at the end of the merge window, after
the subsystem trees have gone in. To facilitate this process, he asks that
developers not merge their trees at the last minute.  It is a real pain for
him when he has only the last few hours of the merge window to work through
his huge pile of patches.
<p>
Linus was a bit less diplomatic about it; he is tired of getting merge
requests late in the window.  So, he says, he wants to have merge requests
in his mailbox on the first day of the merge window.  This should not be a
problem, he says; the code should be ready to go when the window opens.  He
is also increasingly annoyed by developers who merge "inappropriate stuff"
after the merge window closes.  This stuff includes new features, but also
things like code cleanups and such.  If it is not a bug fix, it really
needs to be merged before -rc1.
<p>

Is the -mm tree too experimental?  Andrew says that it really is just the
merger of the various subsystem trees; most of what is in -mm is intended
for the next merge window.  So it really <i>should</i> work.  And there is,
as far as he can tell, no particular part of -mm which creates an
inordinate number of problems.  Mel Gorman said that it generally takes a
day or two for him to get a new -mm release going on his test machines,
though. 
<p>

There were requests for a more real-time view into the current status of
the -mm tree.  For now, all that most people see is the announcement Andrew
sends out when he releases a new tree - something which, he says, has not
been happening often enough recently.  Curious people were pointed at the
mm-commits mailing list, which receives a message every time a patch is
added to or dropped from -mm.  Your editor can attest, however, that this
list is a good way to get a <i>lot</i> of mail.
<p>

Should user-space programs be distributed with the kernel?  In particular,
Andrew is wondering about the various utilities which have currently found
a home in the documentation directory.  The consensus seems to be that
these utilities should be merged into the util-linux distribution instead.
<p>

There was some talk about the -stable tree.  Andrew fears that we are not
doing a good enough job of identifying patches which should go into
-stable.  So he encourages all maintainers to think about it whenever they
accept patches into their tree.  Chuck Ebbert has apparently been looking
over patches for candidates and notifying maintainers when he think they
should consider submitting patches to -stable, but he has, at times, gotten
less than friendly responses back.  Dave Miller suggests sitting on -stable
candidates for a week before sending them in; often further issues come up
which force a rework of the patch.  The one exception, of course, would be
patches for severe security problems.
<p>
It was generally agreed that the -stable tree is useful; distributors are
using it to create the kernels they ship.
<p>
Finally, Andrew brought up the topic of cleanup patches.  Anybody who
watches the kernel patch stream knows that there is a steady flow of
patches which adjust coding style, fix spelling errors, etc.  He hates
these patches, but he has been forced to admit that they do, in the end,
make the kernel better.  So he accepts them.  Most of the developers would
seem to agree.
<p>

What people would like to see, perhaps, is a more targeted approach to
cleanup patches.  Rather than trying to fix a small problem across the
entire tree, pick a file or two with problems and try to take care of
everything there.  It was also noted that there have been problems with
cleanup patches; some of them create subtle bugs or are a non-optimal
solution to the problem.  That would appear to be the way things are,
though: many of these patches are from new developers who are trying to get
into the process.  So they will require review and revision.  But this is a
path by which we bring new hackers into the fold, so the effort is
worthwhile.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Maybe I was not clear on the day, but I was trying to get across that only <br>
2 days to get it working everywhere a good thing. "Only one or two days" <br>
is to getting -mm working on all machines I generally pay attention to. By <br>
and large, it works on my crash-test laptop immediately and only runs into <br>
problems on the less common machines (NUMAQ, some PPC64, some IA64 etc).<br>

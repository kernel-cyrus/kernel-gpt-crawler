<p>A loop device is a kernel abstraction that allows a file to be presented as
if it were a physical block device. The typical use for a loop device is to mount a
filesystem image stored in a file. Loop devices are global and shared between
users, which causes a number of problems for container workloads where the
instances are expected to be isolated from each other. Christian Brauner
has been working on this problem; he has posted a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200424162052.441452-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/">patch
set</a> solving it by adding a small virtual filesystem called loopfs.</p>

<p>
Loop devices typically appear under <tt>/dev</tt> with names like
<tt>/dev/loop<i>N</i></tt>.  The special <tt>/dev/loop-control</tt> file
can be used to create and destroy loop devices or to find the first
available loop device.  Associating a file with a specific device, or
setting other parameters like offsets or block sizes, is done with
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls on the device itself.
The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/loop.4.html"><tt>loop(4)</tt>
man page</a> has the details on how it all works.
<p>
Users generally need not deal with specific devices, though; they can be
managed behind the scenes
with a special <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html#LOOP-DEVICE_SUPPORT">form
of the <tt>mount</tt> command</a>:</p>
<p>
<pre>
    mount /tmp/myimage.img /mnt/disk -o loop
</pre>

<p>This causes <tt>mount</tt> to locate an available loop device, 
associate it with <tt>/tmp/myimage.img</tt>, then mount that loop device
onto <tt>/mnt/disk</tt>.  Some administrators may prefer a different form of the
same mount command that gives more control:</p>
<p>
<pre>
    mount /tmp/myimage.img /mnt/disk -o loop=/dev/loop1
</pre>

<p>In this mode, the administrator specifies 
the exact loop device to use.  An administrator who needs more control
over loop devices may also use the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/losetup.8.html"><tt>losetup</tt></a>
command to query and set up loop-device properties.</p>

<p>As noted above, loop devices are global and shared between users;
<tt>/dev/loop3</tt> is the same device in all namespaces.  If an
application needs a private device, it has no way to request one. Loop
devices are also, obviously, shared between containers, so one
container can monitor the operations — or access the data — of the others.</p>

<p>A number of different use cases for loop devices were raised in the
discussion of this patch set. Dmitry Vyukov <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CACT4Y+aDeSAARG0b9FjDFyWuhjb=YVxpGtsvBmoKnHo+0TF4gA@mail.gmail.com/">gave
one example</a>:
separating test processes from each other when
they are using loop devices. He described the problems he has run into:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
Currently all loop devices and loop-control are global and cause test
processes to collide, which in turn causes non-reproducible coverage
and non-reproducible crashes.
</div></p>

<p>Brauner gave a number of examples from the container world.  For
example, <a
href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2017-August/039453.html">systemd-nspawn
does not support loop devices</a> as they cannot be discovered dynamically
and owned by a container. Chromium OS <a
href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/containers_and_vms.md#loop-mount">does
not allow</a> the use of loop devices.  Kubernetes has also <a
href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1333">run into
problems</a> resulting from the global nature of loop devices: a file can
remain bound to a device after its user has exited.

<h4>loopfs</h4>

<p>Loopfs is a new, in-kernel, virtual filesystem that implements the loop
devices and the <tt>loop-control</tt> file. This filesystem can be
mounted multiple times; the loop devices in each instance are independent
from all other loop devices in all other instances. This allows
private loop devices for applications and containers. Both the loop devices
and the <tt>loop-control</tt> file in loopfs accept the same
operations as the legacy ones.</p>

<p>One use of loopfs is to provide compatibility with old-style
applications, but with virtualized loop-device files. In this case, the
administrator can mount the filesystem and then replace the default
loop control files with those from loopfs.  Consider the following
example, adapted from the patch cover letter:<p>
<p>
<pre>
    # Mount a new loopfs instance in /dev/loopfs/
    mount -t loop loop /dev/loopfs/

    # Replace the standard loop control file with the ones from loopfs
    ln -sf /dev/loopfs/loop-control /dev/loop-control

    # Find the first available loop device
    loopdev=`losetup -f`     	  # will be something like /dev/loop0
    deventry=`basename $loopdev`  # now just "loop0"

    # Redirect that loop device to loopfs
    ln -sf /dev/loopfs/$deventry /dev/$deventry

    # mount an image
    mount -o loop /image.img /mnt/disk
</pre>

<p>
There is a knob provided to control the maximum number of loop devices that
can be created in any given loopfs instance; it can be found as
<tt>/proc/sys/user/max_loop_devices</tt>.

<p>Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200409075320.GA26234@infradead.org/">disagreed</a>
with the loopfs approach, stating that the code is too big for the benefit
it provides. Brauner <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200409083319.nlemf6d7g33hxhiy@wittgenstein/">explained</a>
the additional use cases it allows, but the discussion stopped there.
There have not been other substantial complaints about this proposal.
</p>


<p>Loopfs doesn't just allow an independent loop-device pool, it also opens
a way to allow unprivileged users to mount loop devices.  This can be enabled
by combining loopfs with Brauner's earlier work on <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190920083007.11475-1-christian.brauner%40ubuntu.com/">system-call
interception</a>, which uses <a href="/Articles/656307/">seccomp</a> 
to establish a separate process to make decisions on which operations can
be allowed. In such a setup, the unprivileged user can run <tt>mount</tt> as
usual; the privileged process intercepting the system call will perform the
actual operation.</p>


<p>Jann Horn <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez0KWgLMOp1d3X1AcRNc4-eF1YiCw=PgWiGjtM6PqQqawg@mail.gmail.com/">outlined</a>
one possible problem with loop-device usage by unprivileged applications:
most filesystem implementations are not prepared to deal with malicious
filesystem images.  While some work has been done, filesystem images are
still generally treated as trusted data; that is why previous attempts to
allow unprivileged filesystem mounting <a href="/Articles/755593/">have run
into opposition</a> in the past.  If an attacker has the ability to modify
the image on the fly — as they would if they had access to the loop device
providing that image — the problem would be compounded.

<p>
Stéphane Graber <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CA+enf=uhTi1yWtOe+iuv2FvdZzo69pwsP-NNU2775jN01aDcVQ@mail.gmail.com/">pointed
out</a>
that an implementation based on system-call interception does not have to
mount filesystems directly; a FUSE-based mount could be used instead.  That
would prevent any filesystem-level vulnerabilities from turning into kernel
vulnerabilities. 
The <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/">LXD</a>
implementation allows both types of mount.</p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>Loopfs seems to solve a problem that users experience in practice.  It
has had three iterations in a week's time, addressing the comments given
during the review. It may still take some time to find its way into the
mainline kernel, but it is clear is that there numerous users waiting for
a solution to the loop-device sharing issue.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Legacy applications aside, I wonder if loop-control could just have an ioctl that returns a new file descriptor for a loopback device, and then the new mount API could support passing that file descriptor in to mount it, without having to give it a "loopN" device name.<br>

      There is a provision for creating detached mounts directly with the new API, yes.  We sort of skipped over that in the article, but probably should not have.  The changelog to <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200424162052.441452-3-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/">this patch</a> describes it briefly.

A quick glance didn't seem to indicate it right away, but does anyone know if this mode works with raw disk images? in particular ones that are partitioned (GPT, MBR, etc).  With the normal loopback devices you can tell the kernel to read the partition table from it (losetup -P in particular) and then use that to mount a given partition inside the image without having to do any offset, surgery, or other calculations to do it manually<br>

This does somewhat raise the question of whether FUSE is already an adequate replacement for loop devices in the context of containers. I imagine the answer is "No, because performance," but I would be very interested in seeing actual load tests and experimental results, if any exist.<br>

My answer would rather be a "no because of security/availability", by design FUSE allows to block the Kernel, which is a good reason not to use it in any true multi-user env.<br>

      Loop devices predate the device mapper by a long time and are a separate thing.

dm devices are virtual block devices where the blocks are mapped to other block devices (well, not necessarily directly; they typically go through a module of some sort to add logic). Loopback devices are virtual block devices where the blocks are mapped to a file; think mounting an ISO file as if it were a CD-ROM.<br>
<p>
I guess in theory, you could create a loop backend for dm? But they are separate.<br>

I feel Brauner's response to Hellwig's un-artful and wrong criticism was positive, to-the-point, and convincing. It is a great example of how to deal with what is essentially bullying on lkml or its component lists. I also agree with Brauner that this patch set fulfills more than one needed use case.<br>

It may be a silly question, seeing how nobody mentioned it before, which probably means this is very obvious, but why not a loop device namespace? Wouldn't it be more consistent with the rest of the system?<br>

This problem of separate "/dev spaces" must arise in other contexts too surely.  TTYs?  Non-loop block devices?  I'm surprised that this problem hasn't already been solved more generically for any /dev subset.<br>

Indeed Cellrox implemented device namespaces for android phones which, for instance, virtualized the display so that at any time one android container would have the real display while the other had a null display.  See <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/564854/">https://lwn.net/Articles/564854/</a> for instance from 2013 :)<br>

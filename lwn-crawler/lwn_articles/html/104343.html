<h1>Watching filesystem events with inotify</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted September 29, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
It is not uncommon for applications to want to know when something happens
within a subtree of a filesystem.  File managers are the most obvious
example; if an application creates a new file within a directory
represented in a file manager, users really like to see that new file show
up, quickly.  One could also imagine other sorts of applications - such as
security monitoring code or just daemons wanting to know when their
configuration files have changed - which can benefit from being told about
filesystem activity.
<p>

The Linux mechanism for communicating filesystem events to user space is
called "dnotify."  A program watches a directory by opening it, then
issuing a <tt>fcntl(F_NOTIFY)</tt> call.  Thereafter, changes in that
directory will result in a <tt>SIGIO</tt> signal being sent to the process,
which can then dig through its cached information and try to figure out
just what happened.  People like to complain about dnotify; the interface
is ugly (signals are a pain), it is hard to figure out what the changes
are, it requires keeping files open and thus blocks the unmounting of
removable media, etc.  So there has long been interest in a replacement.
<p>

The most visible effort in that direction is inotify, which has been under
development (by John McCutchan) for some time now; recently Robert Love has
jumped in to help the project along.  <a href="/Articles/104312/">inotify
0.11</a> was released on September&nbsp;28, and an increasingly strong push
is being made to get it included into -mm for wider exposure and testing. 
<p>

inotify works through a new character pseudo-device.  Any application which
wants to monitor filesystem activity need only open <tt>/dev/inotify</tt>
and issue one of two <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands to it:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>INOTIFY_WATCH</tt></dt>
<dd>This call provides a filename and a mask of desired events; inotify
    will begin watching the given file (or directory) for activity.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>INOTIFY_IGNORE</tt></dt>
<dd>This call will stop the stream of events for the given file.</dd>
</dl>
<p>

Quite a few possible events can be watched for: <tt>IN_ACCESS</tt> (the
file was accessed), <tt>IN_MODIFY</tt> (the file was changed),
<tt>IN_ATTRIB</tt> (file attributes changed), <tt>IN_OPEN</tt> and
<tt>IN_CLOSE</tt> (for open and close events), <tt>IN_MOVED_FROM</tt> and
<tt>IN_MOVED_TO</tt> (when files are renamed), <tt>IN_CREATE_SUBDIR</tt>
and <tt>IN_DELETE_SUBDIR</tt> (creation and deletion of subdirectories),
<tt>IN_CREATE_FILE</tt> and <tt>IN_DELETE_FILE</tt> (creation and deletion
of files within a directory), <tt>IN_DELETE_SELF</tt> (when a monitored
file is deleted), <tt>IN_UNMOUNT</tt> (when the filesystem containing the
file is unmounted), and a couple of others.  The events themselves are
obtained by simply reading from the device.  Thus a program can block on
the device itself, or use <tt>poll()</tt> to incorporate notifications into
a larger event-processing loop.  No signals are involved.
<p>

The actual implementation of inotify is relatively simple.  The in-core
inode structure is augmented with a linked list of processes interested in
events involving that inode.  When an <tt>INOTIFY_WATCH</tt> call is made,
an entry is made in the corresponding list (and the inode is pinned into
memory for the duration).  Various parts of the filesystem code get an
extra <tt>inotify_inode_queue_event()</tt> call when an action succeeds.
The rest is just the usual overhead of maintaining lists of events for
processes, waking those processes up when new events arrive, etc.
<p>
While most interest and activity seems to be around 
inotify, it is not the only dnotify replacement in circulation; <a
href="/Articles/98922/">nonotify</a> is an alternative.    There
are also some remaining issues about the interface exported by inotify.  It
has been suggested that the inotify <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls should take file
descriptors rather than file names; that change would eliminate problems in
dealing with long file names and would also make access control checks
happen automatically.  The interface would have to be done in such a way
that the application could close the file and still receive events, though;
otherwise dnotify's problems with unmount blocking and excessive use of
file descriptors would just come back again.  These issues notwithstanding,
inotify looks like it is headed for inclusion into a mainline kernel in the
not-too-distant future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Well, the only remaining bad design I saw (perhaps there are others) in inotify was the use of a fixed timer to dispatch events to listening tasks. RML has fixed that this week. Apparently some are still complaining about some quirks here and there, but that means they'll be ironed out soon.<br>

      I remember long ago reading ( I believe on these very pages) that ioctl() was considered a bit skanky, and really people should be making devices that just need read() &amp; write().<br>
<p>
And if one of them has another meaning already, a separate control device should be created. <br>
<p>
That way echo &amp; friends can be used to test/use all this functionality...<br>
<p>
What happened to this idea?<br>

      The ioctl is simply easier to code and use, so it was used.<br>
<p>
The inotify developer is quite willing to switch to a write() based interface, if Linus/Andrew decide it's necessary.<br>

      I wasn't really asking about this specific case. <br>
I was just wondering if this principle was still current... <br>
it seems like new ioctl() calls are coming thick and fast. <br>

      Is there any chance of getting the locate command to use inotify?  Incremental indexing would be sooo nice compared to brinnging my system to its knees at 2:00 every morning.<br>
<p>
Does anybody remember ON:Location?  That was a pretty amazing piece of software...  Of course, writing something like that nowadays would be quite a bit more involved than just patching out a few HFS hooks.<br>

      Here, here. Slocate is an abomination. Something about my laptop that causes the system to really freeze up. I turned it off long ago in favor of running it manually once in a while. It's really amazing such a crude technique has lasted this long. It will be a glorious day when slocate is replaced with something that has proper fs/kernel support.<br>

      Seems a syscall is more appropriate than a special device interface.<br>

      My first reaction was "Why not add pioctl and use that?". For those who don't know pioctl: it's a syscall used by AFS and a couple of other remote fs implmementations. It's essentially ioctl on paths instead of file descriptors. This means that you get rid of the dnotify problems with the need of having the watched file open.<br>
<p>
I have on the other hand not studied this in any depth...<br>

      file/directory change notification would be particularly useful on network files (remote files accessed through network filesystems such as nfs or cifs, or cluster filesystems).  The current D_NOTIFY fcntl can be intercepted by a filesystem.  <br>
<p>
Can filesystems intercept inotify?<br>

      INOTIFY on SUSE 10.0 Linux<br>
<p>
Starting from kernel 2.6.13, inotify is part of the kernel.<br>
/dev/inotify IS NOT AVAILABLE anymore - instead of it, there are system calls<br>
<p>
inotify_init<br>
inotify_add_watch<br>
inotify_rm_watch<br>
<p>
Please see my web page to find out more details:<br>

<a href="/Articles/870415/">Maintainers summit</a>
</div>
In August, a long-running dispute over drivers for AI accelerators <a
href="/Articles/867168/">flared up</a> in the kernel community.  Drivers
for graphics accelerators are required to have at least one open-source
implementation of the user-space side of the driver (which is where most of
the logic is).  Drivers for other types of accelerators  have not, so far,
been held to that same standard, which has created some friction within the
community and an inconsistent experience for developers.  The 2021
Maintainers Summit took up this issue in the hope of creating a more
coherent policy.
<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman is the subsystem maintainer who has accepted a number of
accelerator drivers without applying the open-user-space standard.  He
started off the session by saying that he can't tell developers of these
drivers "no" when there are no standard requirements he can point them to.
Dave Airlie, the DRM (graphics subsystem) maintainer, said that his subsystem
does indeed have those kinds of standards, but acknowledged that it is a lot
to ask that those standards be applied generally.  Saying "no", he said, is
the best way to get developers to put in the effort to do things right; if
the bar is set too low, developers drop their code in, then disappear.
Saying "no" makes them engage more.
<p>
We need, he continued, to be more responsible for the bigger picture, and
that means that we need information about how the hardware the kernel
drives actually works.  That becomes especially true for drivers that use
certain parts of the kernel API, and the DMA-BUF API in particular.
DMA-BUF is a mechanism for drivers to interface with each other; a new
driver using that API will be talking to other complex drivers that "have
been through all the hoops".  There is no desire to compromise the
operation of those drivers through interaction with a new driver whose
developers have not joined the community.
<p>
The Habana AI-accelerator driver, which is what has set off most of the
controversy, is actually better than most, Airlie said.  But it will still
create security problems.  Developers of drivers like this are not experts
on creating secure kernel APIs.  Kroah-Hartman said that, if drivers like
the Habana one are kept out of the kernel, they'll still use APIs like
DMA-BUF, nobody will see it, and the result will be far worse.  But Airlie
repeated that DMA-BUF is a line he does not want to see crossed.
<p>
Kroah-Hartman said he could understand this rule for graphics drivers, but
for drivers like Habana's there is no standard that he can apply.  Airlie
answered that the Habana accelerator is a GPU at heart; one could implement
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl">OpenCL</a> on top of it â€”
something he didn't know until Habana open-sourced its compiler.  If a
vendor is making a compute-only graphics card, he asked, why should they
have to jump through hoops when their competitors don't?
<p>
So, Kroah-Hartman asked, where is the line where drivers need to come with
an open-source user-space implementation?  Airlie said that the Habana
driver was put forward as "not a GPU driver", but now it is using DMA-BUF.
That is where the line should be.  This is the standard that the InfiniBand
subsystem is using as well now.
<p>
Arnd Bergmann said that there are a couple of cases here.  For accelerators
that can run anything, like GPUs can, it makes sense for the drivers to go
through the DRM subsystem and adhere to DRM's rules.  For devices with a
more defined purpose, though, it might be better for them to come in with a
custom kernel interface and lower requirements.
<p>
Kroah-Hartman said that maintainers have to make value judgments; a lot of
new subsystems are submitted to him and he needs to make a decision on
each.  What should he do?  Airlie reiterated that the line should be drawn
at the DMA-BUF and DMA fence APIs.  "A little driver sitting in a corner"
can be merged without a lot of rules, but accelerators inevitably reach the
point where they need to use DMA-BUF.  There is no point in running an
accelerator without access to DMA or graphics.  These devices start simple,
he said, but once they go toward production they get more complex.
Kroah-Hartman agreed to uphold the DMA-BUF line.
<p>
Airlie said that one problem with graphics is that there is no common
user-space API for all GPUs, just "a small discoverability API".  These
devices are so different that any attempt to create a standard API would
just get in the way.  But that means there is little control over the API
that any given driver provides.  
As it is, graphics developers are often finding
interfaces in the drivers that user space has never made use of.
<p>
The DMA-BUF line is good, he said, because using that API brings developers
into contact with the experts.  There is great value in having a community
developer who knows where the user-space code for a device is; that makes
it possible to see which interfaces are actually needed, among other
things.  Vendors need to release the compiler for their devices so that the
DRM developers can see what the hardware is capable of.  If the device can
perform DMA directly, for example, the API has to prevent users from
accessing that capability.
<p>
<h4>Torvalds speaks</h4>
<p>
At this point, Linus Torvalds unmuted to say that he wanted to argue
against some of the points that Airlie was making.  Airlie is coming from a
subsystem
where the community has 25&nbsp;years of experience; there is history and a
community.  The developers know how these devices will work.  When new
people come, though, we don't want to create a high bar to entry.  Yes,
they will do things wrong the first time, but until we let them into the
kernel, they will not learn how to do things right.
<p>
For this reason, Torvalds is in favor of accepting new code and letting
different groups make their own mistakes.  The DRM developers, after all,
screwed a lot of things up badly; that was part of the path toward their
current API.  The DRM developers certainly didn't come in knowing all that
they know now.  The same will be true of companies like Habana; they will
do things wrong, but if we block them, they will never get things right.
That also is why he let ksmbd and the ntfs3 filesystem in for 5.15.
<p>
In other words, he continued, the community should be open to taking in new
subsystems, but should also be more proactive in throwing them out again.
If a subsystem causes problems for others, out it goes.  If there is no
user space for it, why keep it around?  If the Habana driver creates
trouble, it can be thrown out.
<p>
The security issue, he said, is "pure bullshit".  Hardware engineers
already own the machine, and we cannot protect ourselves against what a
device might do; we should worry more about maintainability than
security.  We can't fix hardware-level security problems, but we can try to
ensure maintainability.  Torvalds did say, though, that Airlie was correct
when it comes to use of DMA-BUF.  Drivers are mostly independent, but use
of DMA-BUF is the point where they start to interact with each other, and
that can bring in maintainability problems.
<p>
<h4>Tests</h4>
<p>
Kees Cook spoke up to say that code quality is the real issue here, and
that we just don't have enough automated analysis to assure that quality
anywhere in the kernel.  Where are the tests for ksmbd, he asked?  In
general, there is no way to find out where the tests (if any) for a given
body of code are.  He is not a big fan of BPF, he said, but the BPF
verifier is comprehensive and prevents a lot of problems.
<p>
Ted Ts'o said that the syzbot fuzzing system can be annoying, but it is
also great.  Network filesystems (like ksmbd) are missing a good fuzzing
solution.  Accelerators, each of which has its own instruction-set
architecture, will be an even bigger problem.  Airlie, though, said that
tests don't help if nothing uses the API that the tests are exercising.
They don't help with maintainability, since they can't tell maintainers
which APIs are actively in use.  That is why the DRM developers insist on
an active user space, something with life and developers who can answer
questions.
<p>
Chris Mason said that, as somebody who has been pushing vendors to get
their code into the kernel, he feels that the community is creating an
environment where the NVIDIA model (proprietary drivers) is the most
efficient way to go.  The harder it is to get code upstream, the harder it
is to convince vendors to do the right thing.  So lowering the bar seems
like the right thing to do.  We have to let vendors go though the process
of doing things wrong and feel the associated pain.
<p>
Torvalds talked about a recent conversation with a large company, where he
was surprised to learn that some core developers employed there don't
always want to work upstream.  They tend to be worried about the one
workload they care about, so they hack on that and don't worry about the
larger case.  "Upstream first" is a goal, he said, but it cannot be a hard
requirement.  We want developers to want to work with us; we don't want to
be the straightjacket that they have to work within.  That means we have to
be somewhat flexible.
<p>
Kroah-Hartman said that he wants to take new stuff; that makes its
developers a part of the community and gets them to care about us.  Airlie
replied that vendors only care about customers, so they will only care
about us if their customers do.  Kroah-Hartman continued that we all have
to work together and be accepting; we can't force the creation of a unified
API across competitors before the code is merged.  Mason rephrased that as "we
can't make them drink the Kool-Aid if we don't let them into the
restaurant".
<p>
Ts'o brought this extended discussion to a close by asking if the group was
converging on any sort of consensus.  Is there anything that can be said to
unify the criteria for driver acceptance?  Airlie said that there seemed to
be agreement on drawing the line at use of DMA-BUF and the fence API, and
nobody disagreed with him.
There was a bit of trailing discussion on how to notice when that line was
crossed.  I suggested moving those interfaces into a <a
href="/Articles/760045/">module 
namespace</a>, and Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/YU8oVDFoeD5YYeDT@kroah.com/">posted a patch</a> to
the effect a few days later.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It&#x27;s great to see at least one person used the rare words &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;test&quot; in a discussion which is mostly about... quality and test coverage. Compared to other... non-comparable (?) projects, the kernel mainline has a very strong code review process while deferring the fact of actually running the code to some other satellite place. This entire discussion is basically about raising the requirements for the latter. A little bit. <br>

Except it&#x27;s extremely hard to remove any code or feature, there are a number of articles on LWN on that topic. See also Zawinski&#x27;s law of software envelopment etc.<br>

<p>
Or, you know, working with developers that have respectful communications and are working towards the same goal?  I&#x27;ve exclusively worked upstream for my entire career and I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;d rather just work with people inside my own company, because there I know we&#x27;re working towards the same goal and treat each other with respect.  As opposed to upstream, where people I&#x27;ve worked with for over a decade still treat me and others like we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing, attack each other baselessly, attack each others work because it offends their sense of good taste, and are simply combative to anything that doesn&#x27;t fit their narrow sense of what should be done, refusing to acknowledge there are different usecases and different solutions for those usecases.<br>
<p>
So no, it&#x27;s not about pleasing their management, it&#x27;s about being done with the community and the people in it and wanting to go do good work with people who give a shit and are interested in collaborating with you to get to the best possible solution rather than &quot;winning&quot; or getting their way.<br>

(Very) loud and clear but I insist: &quot;pleasing your management&quot; and &quot;short term objectives&quot; is at work an extremely common thing too :-)<br>

It can be both, nothing mutually exclusive here. Maybe some overlap even.<br>

I&#x27;m glad you have a healthy work environment, but I&#x27;d much rather have the oft-derided &quot;upstream linux&quot; style interactions of the sort you&#x27;ve described where everything is out in the open rather than most of the corporate interactions I&#x27;ve experienced -- On the surface it&#x27;s all smiling multicultural stock photos and rigorous adherence to &quot;the highest standards of conduct&quot; while behind the scenes, other parts of the company are actively working to undermine your team via political skullduggery.<br>

It&#x27;s possible to have both civility and transparency/honesty; you&#x27;re mixing up two different problems. Maybe rare to find both at the same time but not mutually exclusive.<br>
<p>
In fact the &quot;other parts of the company undermining your team via political skullduggery&quot; sounds common but feels off-topic here. Sure it&#x27;s bad but what has that to do with code reviews and running tests? Surely these people don&#x27;t come and nitpick your code, do they? In fact one of the common issues inside companies is too few people looking at code; all eyes on dashboards and spreadsheets instead.<br>

Yes, measuring cooperation is really hard. LWN started measuring Reviewed-by: and other tags so there is hope ;-)<br>

My experience says it&#x27;s rare to have both, and as the size of the team (and communications lag) increases, becomes exponentially rarer.<br>

<p>
It was an example of how &quot;everyone works towards the same goal&quot; is not something that can be taken for granted, even within a single company.  Or even a single team within the same company.<br>
<p>
Goals quickly fall out of alignment as things grow.<br>

<p>
Nope, they go one or two levels up, undermining the underlying premise of project itself and (sometimes) trashing the folks involved as being too myopic to see the bigger picture.<br>
<p>
(My immediate team doesn&#x27;t have enough of a skills overlap for meaningful code/implementation reviews; but we&#x27;re all involved heavily in concept/design reviews)<br>

It is not like there aren&#x27;t plenty of commercial players in Linux, so you get both traditional commercial organization politics internally +  the toxicity out in the open in LKML overflowing into LWN occasionally as well.  These days, after the Linus apology and associated actions <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/764901/">https://lwn.net/Articles/764901/</a> it has gotten better overall. <br>

      <p>This is pretty much why I've stayed far away from the Linux kernel project. Almost all of my experiences with Linux kernel developers have been painful. I've been browbeaten in the past and it's just not fun to engage.</p><p>The only space so far that's been pleasant is the Btrfs group. However, when that intersects with other filesystem folks, or the block/mm folks, I get reminded why I don't really try to get involved. I do not know why people tolerate that behavior. At least for me, since I do all my OSS stuff of my own personal accord, I certainly won't.</p>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Kroah-Hartman said that he wants to take new stuff; that makes its developers a part of the community and gets them to care about us.</font><br>
<p>
That assumes that the developers have at least some sort of interest in being part of the community in the first place. In some case (I was going to say many, but I&#x27;m surely biases there), they&#x27;re forced by customers to submit drivers upstream, and as soon as the driver gets merged, they will disappear completely. I don&#x27;t see the point in merging a driver that can&#x27;t be used by anyone else than the vendor because it requires a closed-source userspace stack when the vendor has no intention whatsoever to even maintaining the kernel driver.<br>

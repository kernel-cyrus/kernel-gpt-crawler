           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 11, 2017</br>
           </div>
"Load tracking" refers to the kernel's attempts to track how much load each
running process will put on the system's CPUs.  Good load tracking can
yield reasonable predictions about the near-future demands on the system;
those, in turn, can be used to optimize the placement of processes and the
selection of CPU-frequency parameters.  Obviously, poor load tracking will
lead to less-than-optimal results.  While achieving perfection in load tracking
seems unlikely for now, it appears that it is possible to do better than
current kernels do.  The <a href="/Articles/740816/">utilization estimation
patch set</a> from Patrick Bellasi is the latest in a series of efforts to
make the scheduler's load tracking work well with a wider variety of
workloads.
<p>
Until relatively recently, the kernel had no notion of how much load any
process was putting on the system at all.  It tracked a process's total CPU
utilization, but that is different from — and less useful than — tracking
how much of the available CPU time that process has been using recently.
In 2013, the <a href="/Articles/531853/">per-entity load-tracking (PELT)
mechanism</a> was merged; it maintains a running average of each process's
CPU demands.  That average decays quickly over time, so that a process's
recent behavior is weighted much more heavily than its distant past.  The
PELT values are maintained (and continue to decay) while processes are
blocked, giving a better overall view of their utilization.
<p>
The addition of PELT improved the scheduler considerably.  It became
possible to estimate just how much CPU a given mix of processes is likely
to need and to distribute those processes across the system in a way that
loads all CPUs equally.  The addition of the "schedutil" CPU-frequency
governor enabled the kernel to set the operating frequencies of the CPUs at
the level needed to service the current load, but no higher.  In short,
PELT is regarded as a clear step forward for the kernel's CPU scheduler.
<p>
That does not mean that PELT is perfect, though; indeed, developers have
been running into its limitations almost since it was merged.  The mobile
and embedded community seems to complain the loudest.  The biggest concern
is almost always responsiveness: PELT can take too long to respond to
changes in the 
system workload.  A user who starts a browser on a mobile device wants it
to respond quickly, but PELT will take a few 32ms measurement cycles to
fully understand the load that the browser is placing on the system.
During that time, the browser may be scheduled inappropriately (alongside
other CPU-intensive tasks, for example) and the CPU it is running on may
not be operating at as high a frequency as it should be.  In fact, running
such a task on a CPU that is running at a slower frequency will cause PELT
to take even longer to generate a realistic estimate.
<p>
In <a href="/Articles/732021/">the first posting of the utilization
estimation patch set</a> (in August 2017), Bellasi expressed the problem
another way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In the mobile world, where some of the most important tasks are
	synchronized with the frame buffer refresh rate, it's quite common
	to run tasks on a 16ms period. This 16ms window is the time in
	which everything happens for the generation of a new frame, thus
	it's of paramount importance to know exactly how much CPU bandwidth
	is required by every task running in such a time frame.
</div>
<p>
PELT operates on a rather longer time scale than 16ms, so several frames will
have gone by before it gets a handle on the load presented by such a
process.  One can, of course, change PELT's accumulation periods, but that
still leaves an unwanted ramp-up period and doesn't address some of the
related issues.  For example, the load estimates from PELT tend to vary
over time as a 
result of the decay algorithm, even when the processes involved are
running regularly.  If a process sleeps for a period of time without work
to do, its load estimate will quickly decay toward zero, meaning that the
scheduler no longer has useful information about its needs once it starts
to run again.
<p>
Various attempts have been made over time to improve the performance of
PELT in this setting.  The <a href="/Articles/706374/#walt">window-assisted load
tracking (WALT)</a> algorithm works mostly by eliminating the decay and
only looking at recent behavior.  WALT has shipped in some devices, but has
not found its way into the mainline, perhaps out of fear of worsening load
tracking for other use cases.  Qualcomm went further by <a
href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/8933/snapdragon-810-performance-preview/4">replacing
much of the scheduler entirely</a> with its out-of-tree variant tuned for
its systems.  This code has not even been posted to the kernel mailing
lists, much less seriously considered for mainline inclusion.
<p>
The current utilization estimation work has taken a simpler approach that
has a better chance of working across all use cases.  It is based on the
observation that, while PELT may struggle to properly characterize
processes that have not been running for long, its measurement of what a
process needed to get to the point where it stops running and goes back to sleep
is good.  But PELT quickly decays that information away and has
to start over the next time the process begins running.  If the kernel
were to track those end-of-run measurements, it would have a better idea of
what the process will need the next time it starts running.
<p>
So the utilization estimation patches do not change the PELT algorithm at
all.  Instead, whenever a process becomes non-runnable, the current
utilization value is added into a new running average that represents the
kernel's best guess for what the process will need the next time it runs.
That average is designed to change relatively slowly, and it is not decayed
while a process it not runnable, so the full value will still be there even
after a long sleep.
<p>
Whenever the system needs to look at the load created by a given running
process,
either to calculate overall CPU loads or to set CPU frequencies, it will
take the greater of the saved estimate or the current load as calculated by
PELT.  The estimate, in other words, is used as a lower bound when
calculating a process's load; if PELT comes up with a higher value, that
value will be used.  When a given process becomes runnable, its
load will be immediately set to this saved estimate, giving the scheduler
the information it needs to properly place the task and set CPU operating
parameters.
<p>
The cost of the new estimation code is approximately a 1% performance hit
when running the <a
href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Tutorial#sched:_Scheduler_benchmarks"><tt>perf
bench sched messaging</tt></a> benchmark (also known as "hackbench"), which
stresses context-switch
performance.  That may be a hit that users with long-running,
throughput-oriented workloads don't want to take, so the patch set leaves
utilization estimation off by default.  Enabling it requires setting the
<tt>SCHED_UTILEST</tt> scheduler feature bit.
<p>
The patch set has received little in the way of review comments as of this
writing.  Getting scheduler changes into the mainline is always difficult
because the chances of regressing somebody's workload tend to be high.  In
this case, though, the existing load-tracking code is left carefully
untouched, so the probability of regressions should be quite low.  Perhaps
that will be enough to make some progress on this longstanding scheduler
issue in the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Great summary and thanks for sharing. What do you think about load estimation under low-latency tasks (especially under high networking bandwidth)? <br>

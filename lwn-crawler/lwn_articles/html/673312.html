As expected, Linus <a href="/Articles/673338/">released</a> the 4.5-rc1
development kernel and 
closed the merge window for this cycle on January&nbsp;24.  Less than 2,000
changes were pulled since <a href="/Articles/672344/">last week's
summary</a>, but there were some significant changes to be found among
them.  Some of the more interesting changes include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A new tool called UBSAN checks a running kernel for various types of
     undefined behavior that can lead to obscure bugs; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c6d308534aef6c99904bf5862066360ae067abc4">the
     commit changelog</a> contains a list of bugs that have already been
     found by UBSAN and fixed.  See <a
     href="/Articles/673317/">Documentation/ubsan.txt</a> for an
     introduction to this tool.
<p>
<li> The new <tt>CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM</tt> option, which blocks access
     to memory (via <tt>/dev/mem</tt>) claimed by device drivers, turned out
     to break booting on some systems, so it is now off by default.
<p>
<li> The ARM multiplatform work, which aims to build a single ARM kernel
     that can boot on a wide variety of processors, has reached an
     important milestone with the <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6b5a12dbca7a8681ecb78dbebaedc1f8364ebd10">merging</a>
     of work to bring a number of minor platforms into the fold.
     <p>
     <div class="BigQuote">
	This branch is the culmination of 5 years of effort to bring the
	ARMv6 and ARMv7 platforms together such that they can all be
	enabled and boot the same kernel.  It has been a tremendous amount
	of cleanup and refactoring by a huge number of people, and creation
	of several new (and major) subsystems to better abstract out all
	the platform details in an appropriate manner.
     </div>
<p>
<li> The filesystems in user space (FUSE) subsystem has added support for
     the <tt>SEEK_HOLE</tt> and <tt>SEEK_DATA</tt> options to the
     <tt>lseek()</tt> system call.
<p>
<li> The <tt>epoll_ctl()</tt> system call supports a new flag,
     <tt>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE</tt>, that causes <tt>epoll_wait()</tt> to only wake
     one process when a file descriptor becomes ready.  See <a
     href="/Articles/633422/#excl">this article</a> for a description of
     this option and the use case for it.
<p>
<li> Direct-access ("DAX") mappings now work properly with the
     <tt>msync()</tt> and <tt>fsync()</tt> system calls.
<p>
<li> The ext4 filesystem has gained "project quota" support, wherein
     dispersed files can be assigned to the same "project" and given their
     own quota.  The feature is rigorously undocumented, but some
     information be found in the header of <a href="/Articles/623835/">this
     patch posting</a>.
<p>
<li> The implementation of the XFS <tt>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR</tt> and
     <tt>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands has been moved
     up to the virtual filesystem level, and an implementation for the ext4
     filesystem has been added.  This operation, also severely
     undocumented, allows the querying (and setting) of various file
     attributes, including immutability, whether writes should always be
     synchronous, exclusion from backups, and more.  See the defines near
     the top of <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/334e580a6f97e2e84d1c19a8679603956acaa622">this
     commit</a> for the list of supported attributes.
<p>
<li> The Ceph filesystem now has support for asynchronous I/O.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> <b>Systems and processors</b>:
     	  Renesas R-Car H3 systems,
	  Ralink MT7621 processors,
	  Microchip PIC32MZDA processors,
	  Socionext UniPhier systems, and
	  NVIDIA Tegra132 processors.
     <p>
     <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     	  Qualcomm "shared memory state machine" controllers,
	  Qualcomm wireless connectivity subsystem controllers,
	  Qualcomm PCIe controllers,
	  TI AMx3 Wkup-M3 inter-processor communication subsystems,
	  Raspberry Pi power domain controllers,
	  TI OMAP dual-mode timers,
	  HiSilicon Hip06 PCIe host controllers,
	  Intel "volume management device" PCI host bridges, and
	  AMD "non-transparent bridge" performance-monitoring hardware.
     </ul>

</ul>
<p>
Finally, back in December, Linus <a href="/Articles/673320/">noticed</a>
that the user-space access utilities (<tt>get_user()</tt> and friends) were
showing up heavily on some profiles, especially on systems where <a
href="/Articles/517475/">supervisor-mode access prevention</a> is in use.
The problem is that, often, the kernel needs to perform several accesses in
a sequence, with the result that access prevention is turned off and back
on numerous times.
<p>
The solution, as is so often the case, is batching: turn off access
prevention once, do all the work, then turn it back on.  To support this
mode of access, Linus has introduced a new set of macros:
<p>
<pre>
    user_access_begin();
    unsafe_put_user(value, user_space_pointer);
    unsafe_get_user(value, user_space_pointer);
    user_access_end();
</pre>
<p>
As he puts it in the comments, the "unsafe" functions are not actually
unsafe if they are used correctly, but developers must pay
attention.  The <tt>unsafe_put_user()</tt> and <tt>unsafe_get_user()</tt>
macros can only be used after a <tt>user_access_begin()</tt> call
is made, and the usual <tt>access_ok()</tt> checks must be done first.  The
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9fd4470ff4974c41b1db43c3b355b9085af9c12a">first
use</a> of these functions is in the user-space string-manipulation 
functions.  Only x86 is supported in 4.5, but support for other
architectures should be forthcoming.
<p>
At the close of the merge window, 10,305 non-merge changesets had
been pulled into the mainline repository.  That suggests that 4.5 will be a
relatively slow development cycle with regard to the number of changes
merged.  Much of that "slowness" can be attributed to a
relatively small merge from the staging tree this time around; otherwise,
the kernel developers appear to be working at full speed.
<p>
If the usual 63-day cycle holds, the release of the final 4.5 kernel can be
expected to happen on March&nbsp;13.  Between now and then, though, there
are certainly numerous bugs to be found and fixed.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Some news sites report 4.5 as having Raspberry Pi 2 support. Is it completely supported out of the box now? Or do we need out-of-tree patches? Rpi2 will be a great learning resource for new kernel developers...<br>

The GPU seems missing from the devicetree, so the simple framebuffer set up by the U-Boot will be used instead.<br>
<p>
Also missing is the VCHIQ interface to the VideoCore, which is used to drive the camera and the analog sound (though it's just the PWM pins, you could just drive them directly).<br>
<p>
Other than that the rest is pretty much there. I2C, I2S, GPIO, USB, UART, PWM. I haven't tried it with RPi 2 yet, but the version 1 boards run mainline all right.<br>

XFS_IOC_[GS]ETXATTR is definitely documented, like all the XFS ioctls are. See the xfsctl(3) man page. No, there hasn't been a new man page written for FS_IOC versions yet.<br>
<p>
XFS project quotas are documented in xfs_quota(8), projid(5), projects(5) and xfsctl(3). The ext4 project quota implementation is supposed to be API and behaviourally identical to XFS project quota (hence the above ioctl move, which is how XFS sets and clears project quota IDs on inodes).<br>
<p>
However, AFAIK none of that has been tested, because the there is no userspace for the ext4 code yet, and no tests in xfstests that exercise it. I only wrote the patches to make xfs_quota work with non-xfs filesystems a couple of weeks ago so that the XFS specific project quota tests can be made to run on ext4 without serious modification. <br>

<p>Agreed, but I wouldn't have guessed that an article on new technology from 3 1/2 years ago would just now be relevant.  What disturbs me more, though, is that Acronymfinder.com didn't have any IT-related acronyms mentioning this, and Google Search was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SMAP">a dud</a> (but apparently there's a Japanese boy band named SMAP!). :-D</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>

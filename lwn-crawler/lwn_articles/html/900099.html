Once upon a time, a simple stack overflow was enough to mount a
code-injection attack on a running system. In modern systems, though,
stacks are not executable and, as a result, simple overflow-based attacks
are no longer possible.  In response, attackers have shifted to
control-flow attacks that make use of the code already present in the
target system.  Hardware vendors have added a number of features intended to
thwart control-flow attacks; some of these features have better support
than others in the Linux kernel.

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control-flow
integrity</a> (CFI) is a set of techniques intended to
prevent control-flow attacks, or at least to reduce the
ability of an attacker to 
hijack the program's control flow. The general idea behind CFI is to label
sources and destinations of indirect jumps (such as calls, branches, and
return instructions) and verify at run time that the actual jump target
matches the label. CFI can be implemented entirely in software,
but there are also
several hardware mechanisms from different vendors that assist in CFI
implementation.


<p>
<h4>Coarse-grain forward-edge protection</h4>
<p>
One common way to corrupt a program's control flow is via indirect jumps,
such as function calls through a pointer variable.  If that pointer can be
somehow overwritten, control can be rerouted to a location of an attacker's
choosing, with unfortunate results.  Just about any program of reasonable
size will contain code segments that will do unwanted things if control
lands in the middle of them.  The term "forward edge" is used to
describe attacks on outgoing control flow.  Purely software-based
protection against forward-edge attacks exists (<a
href="/Articles/898040/">forward-edge CFI in LLVM</a>, for example), but
hardware-based mechanisms exist as well.

<p>
The arm64 and x86 architectures enable coarse-grain protection of the
forward edges using a dedicated <tt>BTI</tt>
(arm64) and <tt>ENDBR{32,64}</tt> (x86) instructions, which create a
"landing pad" for indirect branches. When an indirect branch is executed,
the CPU will check for the landing pad at the target address; if a landing
pad is not found, the CPU will trap. Linux supports these protections for
the kernel itself on both arm64 and x86, however for now only arm64 supports
enabling this feature for user space; the x86 version is 
still under development.

<p>While protection of forward edges prevents jumps into the middle of code
blocks, it is still possible to find useful code immediately following
those landing pads and, of course, there are also the backward edges to
exploit.

<p>
<h4>Return address integrity</h4>

<p>
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">Return-oriented
programming</a> (ROP) attacks
use stack overflows to replace the return address of a function with the
address of a machine-code sequence that performs some action the attacker
needs and which ends with return instruction. Such a
sequence is called "gadget". It is possible to chain multiple gadgets and,
as the size of the program under attack grows, it becomes increasingly easy
for an attacker to create a chain that performs any desired operation.
The term "backward edge" is often used to describe ROP attacks.

<p>
Many architectures store return addresses in a special <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_register">link register</a>. The
non-leaf functions, though, must save the contents of the link register on the
stack before calling another function, then restore the link register after
that function returns.

To protect the on-stack copy of the return address, the arm64 and powerpc
architectures allow storing a cryptographically calculated hash alongside
the address. These architectures provide special instructions that can
generate a random key for crypto operations, create of a hash based
on that key and the address value, and validate that the hash matches the
value loaded from the stack.

<p>There are differences in where that hash is stored; on powerpc systems it's saved on
the stack next to the pointer it protects, while on arm64 systems the hash
occupies unused 
high bits in the pointer itself. The powerpc and arm64 mechanisms are both
supported by GCC and LLVM, but only arm64 has proper support for this
feature (called <a href="/Articles/718888/">pointer authentication</a>)
in the Linux kernel.

<p>Another way to ensure backward-edge integrity is to use a shadow stack
to supplement the regular stack. The shadow
stack stores the return address for each function that is called; whenever
a function returns, the return address on the
normal stack is compared to the address on the shadow stack.
Execution is only allowed to continue if the two addresses match. Both Intel and
AMD implement shadow-stack support in hardware, so that every <tt>CALL</tt>
instruction saves the return address to both the normal and the shadow stack, and
every <tt>RET</tt> instruction verifies that return addresses match. When the return
addresses differ, the CPU generates a control-protection fault. The
shadow-stack 
implementation also affects behavior of other instructions that change the
control flow, including <tt>INT</tt>, <tt>IRET</tt>, <tt>SYSCALL</tt>,
and <tt>SYSRET</tt>.

<p>A shadow stack is more demanding to support than pointer
authentication. The last version of the patches that enable support for
shadow stacks for user space contained 35 patches and was <a
href="/Articles/885220">covered in depth</a> here.  Along with enablement
of the hardware's shadow-stack functionality and plumbing it into the core
kernel, these patches define new kernel APIs that reserve memory for the
shadow stack, enable and disable the shadow-stack functionality, and can
also lock the state of the shadow-stack features. These APIs are intended
to be used by the C&nbsp;library; the overall presence of a shadow stack
should be transparent for most applications.  These patches have not yet
been merged into the mainline kernel, though.

<h4>Special cases</h4>
<p>
Some applications, like <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/">GDB</a> and <a
href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">CRIU</a>, need the ability to control the
execution of other processes, meaning that they require ways to deal with the shadow
stack in a nonstandard way.

The GDB debugger, for example, often needs to jump between the stack
frames of the program being debugged;  it needs to keep the shadow
stack in sync with the normal stack as it moves up and down the call chain.

<p>The contents of the shadow stack can be updated using the
<tt>PTRACE_POKEUSER</tt> command to
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace()</a>,
but another <tt>ptrace()</tt> call is then required to update the 
shadow-stack pointer. There was a proposal to extend <tt>PTRACE_GETREGSET</tt> and
<tt>PTRACE_SETREGSET</tt> to support access to the registers controlling
the shadow-stack
machinery; it was posted as a part of version&nbsp;11 of
the "<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200825002645.3658-1-yu-cheng.yu@intel.com/">Control-flow
Enforcement: Indirect Branch Tracking, PTRACE</a>" series,
but has not been reposted since then. This interface is used by <a
href="https://github.com/intel/gdb">Intel's fork of GDB</a>,
but what the final form of the kernel API for manipulating shadow-stack control
registers will be remains unclear.

<p>Like GDB, CRIU has an intimate relationship with the processes it checkpoints
and restores. The <tt>ptrace()</tt> interfaces intended for GDB are certainly useful
for CRIU, but they are not enough.

Beside the ability to adjust shadow-stack contents and the shadow-stack
pointer, CRIU must be able to restore the shadow stack at the same virtual
address as is was at the time of checkpoint. A possible way to achieve that
is to extend the proposed <tt>map_shadow_stack()</tt> system call to accept
an additional
address parameter; when this parameter is not zero, <tt>map_shadow_stack()</tt>
will behave similarly to <tt>mmap(MAP_FIXED)</tt> and will attempt to
reserve the memory for the shadow stack at the requested location.

<p>Another issue CRIU has to cope with is the need to restore the shadow stack's
contents. Of course, this could be done using <tt>ptrace()</tt>, but that would be slow
and would require major changes to the restore logic. A better way is to
use a special <tt>WRSS</tt> instruction that lets an application write to its own shadow
stack. But this instruction is only available when the shadow stack is
enabled, which presents a problem of its own.
<p>

When the GNU C Library loads a program, it enables or disables shadow-stack
features for that program based on its ELF header, then locks the 
feature state permanently. CRIU uses <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><tt>clone()</tt></a>
to create the restored tasks, with the result that they
inherit the shadow-stack state from the CRIU control process.
So, if CRIU was built with the shadow stack enabled, it wouldn't be able to
restore tasks without shadow stack and vice versa. A solution to this was an
additional <tt>ptrace()</tt> call to override the shadow-stack feature lock.

<p>
CRIU also needs patches to support pointer authentication because, despite
the feature being available for some time now, nobody got around to
implementing it in CRIU.
<p>
<h4>What comes next</h4>

<p>We have not yet seen what  the final form of the kernel APIs exposed by
the shadow-stack implementation will be after it actually lands in the upstream
kernel. After that, GDB, CRIU, and maybe other applications that do tricky
things with their control flow should be updated to cope with restrictions
that shadow stacks pose.


And, after the shadow-stack support for user space settles, there is
another interesting question to answer: what would it take to support a
shadow stack for the Linux kernel and are the complexity and the effort
required worth it?<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There&#x27;s no real difference between CALL and RET. Both change the IP to a different location and both need the same protection. Why did the HW vendors feel the need to invent different mechanisms instead of making every CALL insn be followed by an ENDBR insn so they could verify a RET was returning to _a_ callsite?<br>

At least on architectures with fixed-size instructions (like arm64) a simpler solution would be to look back one instruction to check whether it is a call instruction. On x86-64 that would be trickier.<br>
<p>
Still, that would only help checking whether the return destination is &quot;a&quot; call-site, not that it is &quot;the&quot; call-site that originated the call. Maybe that was not deemed useful enough? You could still return to the middle of any function, even though the return destination is restricted to call-sites.<br>

Well, because returns are much easier to make more robust. We don&#x27;t just return to any call site but to exact call site that was used for this specific stack frame.<br>
<p>
Compared to that forward edge stuff looks weak. And I&#x27;d argue, what is the point building feature that is immediately ~useless from the start.<br>
<p>
But the cost of those shadow stack thingy is huge. It is not just debuggers and criu. Exception handling too. Various forms of longjmp (yes, AFAIR standard only allows to it to &quot;skip&quot; call frames, but in practice some folk have used it for more advanced means, and those will break). {make,swap}context and friends will break too, I think. And some people have built useful software around those too. Are we saying non-standard control flow now requires a syscall (in our still crazy times when syscall latency is sky-high, sadly)<br>
<p>
Also I am curious how that works or doesn&#x27;t work with dlopen-ed codes. If my initial set of modules (executable + .so-s) are compatible, but then I dlopen something legacy what happens ?<br>

&quot;But the cost of those shadow stack thingy is huge.&quot;<br>
<p>
Not so huge. Many Android phones have these enabled. Chrome OS too. Enabling CFI is strongly recommended on Android devices.<br>

The point isn&#x27;t huge in the sense of performance cost: it&#x27;s huge in the sense of complexity cost. This has needed a whole new mechanism in glibc ld.so to identify cases where shared libraries compiled without CET support are loaded at startup or via dlopen into a process which has CET support active: all you can do in that case is to fail the load (IIRC), reducing reliability unless you do a whole-distro rebuild with CET enabled and never run libraries obtained from any other source. Every single thing involving unusual patterns of control flow needed (often extremely tricky) modification. Some things (like setjmp) involve fixed-size structures baked into user programs: a perennial source of pain, but this made that pain a bit worse. And so on.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 7, 2010</br>
           </div>
One of the biggest internal changes in 2.6.36 will be the adoption of <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/355700/">concurrency-managed workqueues</a>.
The short-term goal of this work is to reduce the number of kernel threads
running on the system while simultaneously increasing the concurrency of
tasks submitted to workqueues.  To that end, the per-workqueue kernel
threads are gone, replaced by a central set of threads with names like
<tt>[kworker/0:0]</tt>; workqueue tasks are then dispatched to the threads
via an algorithm which tries to keep exactly one task running on each CPU
at all times.  The result should be better use of the CPU for workqueue
tasks and less memory tied up by the workqueue machinery.
<p>
That is a worthwhile result in its own right, but it's really only a
beginning.  The 2.6.36 workqueue patches were deliberately designed to
minimize the impact on the rest of the kernel, so they preserved the
existing workqueue API.  But the new code is intended to do more than
replace workqueues with a cleverer implementation; it is really meant to be
a general-purpose task management system for the kernel.  Making full use
of that capability will require changes in the calling code - and in code
which does not yet use workqueues at all.
<p>
In kernels prior to 2.6.36, workqueues are created with
<tt>create_workqueue()</tt> and a couple of variants.  That function will,
among other things, start up one or more kernel threads to handle tasks
submitted to that workqueue.  In 2.6.36, that interface has been preserved,
but the workqueue it creates is a different beast: it has no dedicated
threads and really just serves as a context for the submission of tasks.
The API is considered deprecated; the proper way to create a workqueue now is
with:
<p>
<pre>
    int alloc_workqueue(char *name, unsigned int flags, int max_active);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>name</tt> parameter names the queue, but, unlike in the older
implementation, it does not create threads using that name.  The
<tt>flags</tt> parameter selects among a number of relatively complex
options on how work submitted to the queue will be executed; its value can
include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> <b><tt>WQ_NON_REENTRANT</tt></b>: "classic" workqueues guaranteed 
     that no task would be run by two threads simultaneously on the same
     CPU, but made no such guarantee across multiple CPUs.  If it was
     necessary to ensure that a task could not be run simultaneously
     anywhere in the system, a single-threaded workqueue had to be used,
     possibly limiting concurrency more than desired.  With this flag, the
     workqueue code will provide that systemwide guarantee while still
     allowing different tasks to run concurrently.
<p>
<li> <b><tt>WQ_UNBOUND</tt></b>: workqueues were designed to run tasks on
     the CPU where they were submitted in the hope that better memory cache
     behavior would result.  This flag turns off that behavior, allowing
     submitted tasks to be run on any CPU in the system.  It is intended
     for situations where the tasks can run for a long time, to the point
     that it's better to let the scheduler manage their location.
     Currently the only user is the object processing code in the FS-Cache
     subsystem.
<p>
<li> <b><tt>WQ_FREEZEABLE</tt></b>: this workqueue will be frozen when the
     system is suspended.  Clearly, workqueues which can run tasks as part
     of the suspend/resume process should not have this flag set.
<p>
<li> <b><tt>WQ_RESCUER</tt></b>: this flag marks workqueues which may be
     involved in memory reclaim; the workqueue code responds by ensuring
     that there is always a thread available to run tasks on this queue.
     It is used, for example, in the ATA driver code, which always needs to
     be able to run its I/O completion routines to be sure it can free
     memory.
<p>
<li> <b><tt>WQ_HIGHPRI</tt></b>: tasks submitted to this workqueue will put
     at the head of the queue and run (almost) immediately.  Unlike
     ordinary tasks, high-priority tasks do not wait for the CPU to become
     available; they will be run right away.  That means that multiple
     tasks submitted to a high-priority queue may contend with each other
     for the processor.
<p>
<li> <b><tt>WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE</tt></b>: tasks on this workqueue can be
     expected to use a fair amount of CPU time.  To keep those tasks from
     delaying the execution of other workqueue tasks, they will not be
     taken into account when the workqueue code determines whether the CPU
     is available or not.  CPU-intensive tasks will still be delayed
     themselves, though, if other tasks are already making use of the CPU. 
</ul>
<p>

The combination of the <tt>WQ_HIGHPRI</tt> and <tt>WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE</tt>
flags takes this workqueue out of the concurrency management regime
entirely.  Any tasks submitted to such a workqueue will simply run as soon
as the CPU is available.
<p>
The final argument to <tt>alloc_workqueue()</tt> (we <i>are</i> still
talking about <tt>alloc_workqueue()</tt>, after all) is
<tt>max_active</tt>.  This parameter limits the number of tasks which can
be executing simultaneously from this workqueue on any given CPU.  The
default value (used if <tt>max_active</tt> is passed as zero) is 256, but
the actual maximum is likely to be far lower, 
given that the workqueue code really only wants one task using the CPU at
any given time.
Code which requires that workqueue tasks be executed in the order in which
they are submitted can use a <tt>WQ_UNBOUND</tt> workqueue with
<tt>max_active</tt> set to one.
<p>
(Incidentally, much of the above was cribbed from <a
href="/Articles/403918/">Tejun Heo's in-progress document</a> on workqueue
usage).
<p>
The long-term plan, it seems, is to convert all <tt>create_workqueue()</tt>
users over to an appropriate <tt>alloc_workqueue()</tt> call; eventually
<tt>create_workqueue()</tt> will be removed.  That task may take a little
while, though; a quick grep turns up nearly 300 call sites.
<p>
An even longer-term plan is to merge a number of other kernel threads into
the new workqueue mechanism.  For example, the block layer maintains a set
of threads with names like <tt>flush-8:0</tt> and <tt>bdi-default</tt>;
they are charged with getting data written out to block devices.  Tejun
recently <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/403653/">posted a patch</a> to
replace those threads with workqueues.  This patch has made some developers
a little nervous - problems with writeback could create no end of trouble
when the system is under memory pressure.  So it may be slow to get into
the mainline, but it will probably get there eventually unless regressions
turn up.
<p>
After that, there is no end of special-purpose kernel threads elsewhere in
the system.  Not all of them will be amenable to conversion to workqueues,
but quite a few of them should be.  Over time, that should translate to less
system resource use, cleaner "<tt>ps</tt>" output, and a better-running
system.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

That's a tolerable cost, I'd say. Right now, my quad-core hyperthreaded Nehalem (not *that* beefy a machine) creates nearly a thousand kernel threads at startup (e.g. one direct-IO thread per ext4 filesystem per CPU!). That's way past ridiculous. Anything that fixes it is a good thing.<br>

Yes, but you only got to see those threads that were spun off as dedicated threads. It's a case of "just because it's easy to measure doesn't mean it's the whole picture."<br>

Perhaps the kernel thread's comm can be (optionally) changed to include the name of the workqueue it's currently running work for?  Similar to the way init's comm tells you what runlevel it's in.<br>

What I think "writeback" means is flushing stuff to disk. The problem with that, is that this sometimes requires allocating memory. CATCH 22!<br>
<p>
If you're short of memory, but you can't free up buffers (and memory) because you need a little bit of extra memory before you can flush said buffers ...<br>

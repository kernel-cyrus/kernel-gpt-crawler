<p>
As preparation for this year's Kernel Summit gets underway, a new "more
transparent" process is being used to
select the 80-100 participants.  The Summit will take place August 27-29,
just prior to 
LinuxCon North America in San Diego. Those interested in attending are
being asked to describe the technical expertise they will bring to the
meeting, as well as to suggest topics for discussion.  All of that is
taking place on the <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/mailman/listinfo/ksummit-2012-discuss">ksummit-2012-discuss</a>
mailing list since the <a href="/Articles/502181/">announcement</a> on June
14, so it seems worth a look to see what kinds of topics may find their way
onto the agenda. 
</p>

<p>
Development process issues are a fairly common topic at the summit and they
figure in a number of the suggestions for this year.  One of the hot topics
is the role of maintainers with multiple, at least partly related, ideas
about discussions in that area.  Thomas Gleixner <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000027.html">noted</a>
a few concerns that he had in a mini-rant:
<div class="BigQuote">
So the main questions I want to raise on Kernel Summit are:
<p>
   - How do we cope with the need to review the increasing amount of
     (insane) patches and their potential integration?
<p>
   - How do we prevent further insanity to known problem spaces (like
     cpu hotplug) without stopping progress?
<p>
A side question, but definitely related is:
<p>
   - How do we handle "established maintainers" who are mainly
     interested in their own personal agenda and ignoring justified
     criticism just because they can?
</div>
</p>

<p>
As one might guess, that kicked off a bit of a conversation about those
problems on the list, but also led several developers to concur about the
need to discuss the problems at the summit.  Somewhat more diplomatically, Trond
Myklebust <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000066.html">suggested</a>
a related discussion on a possible restructuring of the maintainer's role:
<div class="BigQuote">
Currently, the Linux maintainer appears to be responsible for filling
all of the traditional roles of software architect, software developer,
patch reviewer, patch committer, and software maintainer.
<p>
My question is whether or not there might be some value in splitting out
some of these roles, so that we can assign them to different people, and
thus help to address the scalability issues that Thomas raised?
</div>
</p>

<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman also <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000128.html">wants</a>
to talk about maintainership and offered to "referee" a discussion.  He has
some ideas that he <a href="/Articles/500443/">described at LinuxCon
Japan</a> and in a recent <a href="/Articles/502486/">linux-kernel
posting</a> that he thinks "will go a long ways in helping smooth this
out".  John Linville also <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000154.html">expressed
interest</a> in that kind of discussion.
</p>

<p>
Another area that is generating a lot of interest is the stable tree.
Kroah-Hartman is <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000128.html">interested
in finding out</a> how the process is working for the other kernel
developers:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] is it going well for
    everyone?  Are there things we can do differently?  How can I kick
    maintainers who don't mark patches for stable backports in ways that
    do not harm them too much?  How can I convey decisions about the
    longterm kernel selection process in a better way so that it isn't
    surprising to people?
</div>
</p>

<p>
Based on the number of other submissions that mentioned the stable tree,
there seems to be a fair amount to discuss.  The relationship between the
stable tree and the distributions is one fertile area.  Kroah-Hartman <a href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000131.html">said</a>
that he often has to go "digging through distro kernel trees" to find
patches to apply, to which Andrew Morton <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000139.html">suggested</a>
that the "distro people
need a vigorous wedgie" for not making that easier.  Various distribution
kernel maintainers (e.g. Josh Boyer and Jiri Kosina) agreed that the
distributions could do better, but that some discussion of the process
would be worthwhile. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, some discussion of how distributions could better work with
the upstream kernel for regression tracking and bug reporting was <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000011.html">proposed</a>
by Boyer. Kosina <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000016.html">wants
to discuss</a> the stable review process with an eye toward helping
distributions decide which patches to merge into their kernels.
Mark Brown is also <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000092.html">interested</a>
but from the perspective of embedded rather than enterprise distributions.
Others also expressed interest in having stable/longterm tree discussions.
</p>

<p>
How to track bugs and regressions was a topic <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000007.html">proposed</a>
by Rafael Wysocki, who has been reporting to the summit on that topic for
many years.  He was joined by Dave Jones, who would like to <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000039.html">report
on bugs and regressions</a>, both those found by his "trinity"
stress-testing tool and ones that have been found in the Fedora kernel over
the last year.  Like Wysocki, Kosina is also interested in discussing whether
the kernel bugzilla is the right tool for tracking bugs and regressions.
</p>

<p>
Kernel testing is another area that seems ripe for a discussion.  Fengguang
Wu would like to <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000052.html">report</a>
on his efforts to test kernels as each new commit is added:
<div class="BigQuote">
And I would like a chance to talk about doing kernel tests in a timely fashion:
whenever one pushes new commits to git.kernel.org, build/boot/stress tests will
be kicked off and possible errors be notified back to the author within hours.
<p>
This fast develop-test feedback cycle is enabled by running a test
backend that is able to build 25000 kernels and runtime test 3000
kernels (assuming 10m boot+testing time for each kernel) each day.
Just capable enough to outrace our patch creation rate ;-)
<p>
On an average day, 1-2 build errors are caught in the 160 monitored kernel trees.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Wu's posting spawned a long thread where various developers described their
test setups and what could be done better.  Jones <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000182.html">mentioned</a>
the Coverity scanner in that thread, which led Jason Wessel to <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000266.html">highlight</a>
Jones's comment as well as give more information on the tool and the kinds
of information it can provide.  More and better automated kernel testing is
definitely on the minds of a lot of potential summit attendees.
</p>

<p>
James Bottomley would <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000051.html">like
to eliminate "kernel work creation schemes"</a>, in particular he targeted
the amount of code that is needed to support <tt>CONFIG_HOTPLUG</tt>:
<div class="BigQuote">
[...] the
massive proliferation of __dev... _mem... __cpu... and their ilk are
getting out of control.  Plus, the amount of memory they save is tiny (a
few pages at best) and finally virtually no-one compiles without
CONFIG_HOTPLUG, so they're mostly nops anyway.  However, for that very
case, we've evolved a massive set of tools to beat ourselves up whenever
we violate the rules of using these tags.  What I'd like to explore is
firstly, can we just eliminate CONFIG_HOTPLUG and make it always y (this
will clear up the problem nicely) or, failing that, can we just dump the
tags and the tools and stop causing work for something no-one cares
about.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There were few defenders of <tt>CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n</tt> in the thread, but he
was also interested in finding ways to avoid constructs that lead to a lot
of code churn to no good end.  In a somewhat similar vein, H. Peter Anvin
would like to discuss the <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000070.html">baseline
requirements</a> for the kernel.  Supporting some of the niche
uses of Linux (on exotic hardware or with seriously outdated toolchains)
creates an ongoing cost for kernel hackers that Anvin would like to see
reduced or eliminated.
</p>

<p>
Several PCI topics were proposed, including <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000008.html">PCI
root bus hotplug issues</a> by Yinghai Lu and a <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000025.html">PCI
breakout session</a> that Benjamin Herrenschmidt suggested.  In the latter,
Lu's work, some PCI-related KVM issues, cleaning up some PowerPC special
cases, and the rework of the PCI hotplug
core could all be discussed.  As  Herrenschmidt put it: "I think there's enough material to keep us busy and a face to face round
table with a white board might end up being just the right thing to do".
</p>

<p>
Memory management topics also seem popular. Glauber Costa <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000106.html">proposed</a>
several topics, including kmem tracking and per-memory-control-group kmem
memory shrinking, while Hiroyuki Kamezawa <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000192.html">suggested</a>
memory control group topics.  Johannes Weiner is also interested in <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000237.html">talking
about a separate memory management tree</a> that would supplement the work
that Morton does with the -mm tree.  The ever-popular memory control group
writeback topic was also suggested by Wu and Weiner.
</p>

<p>
Srivatsa S. Bhat would like to <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000228.html">present
a newcomer's perspective</a> on kernel development with an eye toward
reducing some of the challenges new developers face.  Josef Bacik has a <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000239.html">similar
idea</a>, and would like to discuss how to make it easier for new
contributors.  In addition to a report on work in the USB subsystem
(and USB 3.0 in particular), Sarah Sharp would <a
href="http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2012-discuss/2012-June/000006.html">like</a>
to "do a brief
readout" about what she learns at AdaCamp in July:
<div class="BigQuote">
AdaCamp is a conference
focused on gathering tech women together to work on solutions for
getting women into open technology fields, and retaining them.  I think
this would be of interest to the Linux kernel community, since we have
very few women kernel developers.  I hope to keep this read out focused
on positive changes we can make.
</div>
</p>

<p>
As one can see, these proposals (and many more that were not mentioned)
range all over the kernel map.  There tends to be a focus on more process
and social aspects of the kernel at the summit, mostly because the hardcore
technical topics are generally better handled by a more focused group.  The
summit tries to address global concerns, and there seem to be plenty
to choose from.

The service Coverity provides is of course a great ressource but I would love to see someone setup a similar service using Clang's static analysis tools. I think Fujitsu has been working on making running such tests on the Linux kernel possible.<br>

Being Open Source LLVM's set of tools would likely allow for a good fit over time. Google has been doing something similar for their Chromium codebase for a while and the results are quite impressive. They even test that their coding style is kept using Clang.<br>

<p>
That's funny - I consider "software architect" to be distinct from all of those things.  The only word I know that covers them all is "maintainer."

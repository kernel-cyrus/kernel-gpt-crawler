           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 29, 2021</br>
           </div>
Filesystem developers tend to disagree with each other about many things,
but they are nearly unanimous in their dislike for the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/truncate.2.html"><tt>truncate()</tt></a>
system call, which chops data off the end of a file.  Implementing
<tt>truncate()</tt> tends to be full of traps for the unwary — the kind of
traps that can lead to lost data.  But it turns out that a similar
operation, called "hole punching", may be worse.  This operation has been
subject to difficult-to-hit but real race conditions in many filesystems
for years; <a href="/ml/linux-mm/20210715133202.5975-1-jack@suse.cz/">this
patch set from Jan Kara</a> may finally be at a point where it can fill the
hole in hole punching.
<p>
Hole punching, as its name suggests, is the act of creating a hole in the
middle of a file; it is performed using the <tt>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE</tt>
option to the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html"><tt>fallocate()</tt></a>
system call.  The caller provides an offset and a length; the kernel then
erases the given number of bytes in the file, starting at the provided
offset.  The associated blocks on the underlying storage device are freed
for other uses.  The length of the file does not change, though; this
operation creates a hole that, if read, will return zeroes.  It is,
essentially, an efficient way of writing zeroes to the specified range
within the file.
<p>
Note that neither the offset nor the length must be page-aligned.  The
kernel will write zeroes to the partial pages at the beginning and end of
the hole, should they exist; this edge work is essentially just a couple of
<tt>write()</tt> calls.  The efficiency gains of hole punching, though,
come from its ability to simply drop entire pages from the file without
writing anything; that, naturally, is also where the challenges lie.
<p>
To implement (the full-page part of) hole punching, a filesystem must do (at
least) two things:
remove the associated pages from the page cache, and free the blocks on the
storage device.  A failure to do either could leave the old data visible
in the file, which is something that user space has just made an explicit
request to prevent.  But, even if both tasks are properly carried out, there is
another way in which things can go wrong.
The problem is that, in current kernels, there is nothing that ties those
two operations together into an atomic change, meaning that something else
can happen between one
and the other.
<p>
Specifically, a filesystem can clear the relevant pages out
of the page cache in the usual way, but then race against another task that
is trying to access the same file.  Should that other task access one or
more of the hole-punched pages in the file, they can be reinstated in the
page cache before the filesystem has done the work of cleaning up the
blocks on disk, leaving stale information in the page cache that may get
written back out at some future time.
That could lead to any of a number of unpleasant things,
including the old data persisting, exposure of unrelated data, or
corruption of the filesystem.  That 
can punch a hole in the user's trust in the system overall.
<p>
This race is clearly difficult to hit, or there would have been a stream of
corruption reports since hole punching was added to 2.6.38 just over ten
years ago.  But it is a real race that will surely bite somebody sooner or
later; it needs to be fixed.  Doing that properly has required ten versions of
Kara's patch set (at last count) since early 2021.
<p>
The solution is conceptually simple: filesystems must take a lock that
prevents hole punching and the instantiation of page-cache entries from
happening at the same time.  But the words "simple" and "locking" are
rarely found together in the filesystem realm.  In this case, the locks
normally used to serialize operations on page-cache pages cannot be used,
since the point is that the pages should be absent.  Other existing locks
run into locking-order issues.  So Kara had to add a new lock (a
reader-writer semaphore, specifically) to the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13.5/source/include/linux/fs.h#L435"><tt>address_space</tt>
structure</a> that describes a mapping between the page cache and a file.
This lock, called <tt>invalidate_lock</tt>, prevents operations that
instantiate page-cache pages (readers, in the sense of this lock) from
racing with those that invalidate pages and underlying storage (writers).
<p>
The way filesystems use this lock varies a bit, depending on their internal
architecture, but the end result is the same: the race is closed in almost
all of the filesystems that support hole punching in the first place.
There are a couple of exceptions, specifically the GFS and OCFS2 cluster
filesystems, where everything is more complex and the maintainers need to
be involved; fixes for those filesystems are still under development.
<p>
This work was deemed ready to go and was pushed to Linus Torvalds for the
5.14 merge window, but Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/CAHk-=whuUxfoYj=dRnzRybg_sOdFPMDx_t06Lz936Pgnh6QCTQ@mail.gmail.com/">was
not impressed</a>: "<q>There is no way I'll merge something this
broken</q>" was his response.  He was unhappy with the use of the new
lock, which was 
being acquired even in situations where the page(s) in question already
exist in the page cache and do not need to be instantiated.  Finding pages
in the page cache is one of the most performance-critical functions in the
kernel, so adding unnecessary overhead there is highly unwelcome.  Fixing that
required another iteration of the patch set — and another development cycle
waiting for the merge window to open again.
<p>
By all appearances, this work <i>is</i> now ready to go for 5.15; once that
happens, this particular obscure race will have been closed.  Even though
the problem is evidently hard to hit, it would not be surprising to see
this work backported to older kernels once a sufficient level of confidence
in its stability has been reached.  That will help to ensure that
hole-punched files remain whole.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>As always, I enjoyed very much this report from our favourite editor. Even when it's filled with hole-related word games:</p>

<ul>
<li>"...may be at a point where it can fill the hole in hole punching."</li>

<li>"That can punch a hole in the user's trust in the system overall."</li>

<li>"That will help to ensure that hole-punched files remain whole."</li>

</ul>

Thanks Jon for such a joyful read :-)

Interesting point. Reminds me of the SR-71 that is designed to leak gas until it reaches speed and properly expands. <br>

At the very least something like this might be a nice compile option? Although I’m learning Linus isn’t a fan of tuning knobs and prefers sensible defaults. <br>

[to continue the analogy] I would expect that people would decide that instead of only needing 32 leaking SR-71&#x27;s out of 50,000 planes, it would be cheaper and faster to make sure all planes leaked similarly. Sure many planes might regularly explode on the runway, but that just means we have builtin lifetimes and we can make them buy new planes regularly!<br>

The analogy breaks down when you consider that (a) jet fuel is much more akin to diesel than to petrol/gasoline and (b) the SR-71 is only very slightly leaky at room temperature anyway :)<br>

But you wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing reliability that way unless the whole community went that way. You would just double to amount of cases that could develop bugs in the future if you made something like this optional.<br>

Plenty of languages I&#x27;ve used have &quot;enforce this optionasl feature&quot; flags. Just say (I know, people don&#x27;t read the documentation) that there&#x27;s no point using this feature without the &quot;enforce it&quot; flag.<br>
<p>
When I programmed FORTRAN I actually explicitly used the IMPLICIT command (to define P and Q as defaulting to boolean), but I then also invoked the &quot;no implicit definitions&quot; flag. So anybody looking at my code could both see the conventions I was using (so they could guess the type), but then there also had to be an explicit declaration so another programmer could check the type, and the compiler could check the spelling! :-)<br>

The lock will not be taken when the pages in question are already present. If they are not they are read from disk: the cost of the associated disk access eclipses any performance hit caused by acquiring the lock. Thus I don&#x27;t see any reason for making the lock optional, as there should be no observable performance hit.<br>

So? it&#x27;s still much more costly to set up the I/O transfer (which AFAIR isn&#x27;t lock-free either) than taking a simple read lock. You definitely will not be able to demonstrate, let alone measure, any performance degradation. The speed of the underlying storage doesn&#x27;t matter here, and neither does now many cores you have.<br>

Jan Kara measured the performance impact, he said that in about 5% of the cases in his simple test it still ended up not necessary to read the data back in.<br>
<p>
So apparently there *was* a performance impact, which has now been fixed.<br>

That would be possible (but note that you&#x27;d loose also stuff like reflink on XFS which uses this lock as well). But the cost in terms of code complexity (having to maintain different sets of supported features with different locking rules) is in my opinion not worth the speed gain in this case.<br>

Well, Spectre is a different kind of problem - you are guaranteed the final result is correct, just you can exfiltrate some additional information from the timing. In this case, a completely valid sequence of calls can result (admittedly with very low probability) in a kernel crash or filesystem corruption. So userspace would have to guarantee nobody operates on the file while hole punch is running or we&#x27;d have to disable hole punch support when disabling the lock or something like that. IMO the complexity for the tiny speed gain is not worth it.<br>

Energy-aware scheduling — running a system's workload in a way that
minimizes the amount of energy consumed — has been a topic of active
discussion and development for some time; LWN first <a
href="/Articles/474915/">covered the issue</a> at the beginning of 2012.
Many approaches have been tried during the intervening years, but little in
the way of generalized energy-aware scheduling work has made it into the
mainline.  Recently, <a href="/Articles/749738/">a new patch set</a> was
posted by Dietmar Eggemann that 
only tries to address one aspect of the problem; perhaps the problem domain
has now been simplified enough that this support can finally be merged.
<p>
In the end, the scheduler can most effectively reduce power consumption by
keeping the system's CPUs in the lowest possible power states for the
longest time — with "sleeping" being the state preferred over all of the
others.  There is a tradeoff, though, in that users tend to lack
appreciation for saved power if their systems are not responsive; any
energy-aware scheduling solution must also be aware of throughput and
latency concerns.  A failure to balance all of these objectives across the
wide range of machines that run Linux has been the bane of many patches
over the years.
<p>
There have been a number of clever ideas that have been attempted, of
course.  <a href="/Articles/520857/">Small-task packing</a> tries to group
small, sporadic processes onto a small number of CPUs to prevent them from
waking the others.  <a href="/Articles/546664/">Other patch sets</a> have
used a spreading technique in an attempt to evacuate CPUs with relatively
low loads.  There has been talk of a separate <a
href="/Articles/570353/">power scheduler</a> whose job is to run each CPU
at the optimal power level for the current workload.  The <a
href="/Articles/600419/">energy cost model</a> created a data structure to
track the performance and energy cost of each processor state and used it
to inform scheduling decisions.  The <a
href="/Articles/706374/">SchedTune</a> CPU-frequency governor allows some
tasks to be designated as "important", with the less-important ones being
relegated to low amounts of CPU power.  Some of these ideas have influenced
the mainline scheduler but, as a whole, they remain outside.
<p>
Saving energy is valuable in almost every setting from tiny embedded
systems to supercomputer installations.  But the pressure tends to be most
acutely felt in the area of mobile systems; the less power a device uses,
the longer it can run before exhausting its battery.  It is thus not
surprising that most of the energy-aware scheduling work has been driven by
the mobile market. The Android Open Source Project's kernel includes a
version of the energy-aware scheduler patches; those have been shipping on
handsets for some time.  Scheduling, as a result, is one of the areas where
the Android and mainline kernels differ the most.
<p>
Eggemann's patch set is intended to reduce that difference by proposing a
simplified version of the Android scheduler.  To that end, it only
addresses the problem for asymmetric systems — those with CPUs that have
varying power characteristics, such as the ARM big.LITTLE processors.
Since the "little" processors are much more energy-efficient (but much
slower) than the "big" ones, the placement of processes in the system can
have a significant effect on both energy consumption and performance.
Improving task placement under mainline kernels on big.LITTLE systems is
arguably the most urgent problem in the energy-aware scheduling area.
<p>
To get there, the patch set adds a simplified version of the energy-cost
model used in the Android scheduler.  It is defined entirely with these two
structures:
<p>
<pre>
    struct capacity_state {
	unsigned long cap;	/* compute capacity */
	unsigned long power;	/* power consumption at this compute capacity */
    };

    struct sched_energy_model {
	int nr_cap_states;
	struct capacity_state *cap_states;
    }
</pre>
<p>

The units of both <tt>cap</tt> and <tt>power</tt> are not really defined,
but they do not need to be as long as they are used consistently across the
CPUs of the system.  There is one <tt>capacity_state</tt> structure for
each power state of each CPU, so the scheduler can immediately determine
what the cost (or benefit) of changing a given CPU's state would be.  Each
CPU has a <tt>sched_energy_model</tt> structure containing the data for all
of its available power states.
<p>
This information, as it turns out, is already available in some systems at
least, since the thermal subsystem makes use of it to help keep the system
from overheating.  That is a useful attribute; it means that a scheduler
with these patches could be run on existing hardware without the
need to provide more information (through device-tree entries, for
example).
<p>
The scheduler already performs load tracking, which allows it to estimate
how much load each process will put on a CPU when it is run there.  That
load estimate is used along with the energy model to determine where a task
should run when it wakes up.  This is done by looking at each CPU in the <a
href="/Articles/80911/">scheduling domain</a> where the process last ran
and determining what the energy cost of placing the process on each CPU
would be.  Essentially, if the CPU would have to go to a higher power state
to run the added load in a timely manner, the cost would be the additional
energy needed to sustain that higher state.  In the end, the CPU with the
lowest added cost is the one the will run the new process.
<p>
The process wakeup path is rather performance-critical, so the above
algorithm raises some red flags.  Iterating over every CPU in the system
(or even just a subset in a given domain) could become quite expensive in a
system with a lot of CPUs.  This algorithm is only enabled on asymmetric
systems, which minimizes that cost because such systems (currently) have a
maximum of eight CPUs.  Those also are the systems that benefit most from
this sort of energy-use calculation.  Data-center systems with large
numbers of identical CPUs would see little improvement from this approach,
so it is not enabled there.
<p>
Even on asymmetric systems, though, this algorithm will not help if the
system is already running near its capacity; in that case, the CPUs will
already be running at a high power point and there is little value to be
had from looking at power costs.  If the scheduling domain where the
process last ran is determined to be "overutilized", defined as running at
80% of its maximum capacity or higher, then the current wakeup path (which
tries to find the most lightly loaded CPU) is used instead.
<p>
Some benchmarks posted with the patch set show some significant energy-use
improvements with the patches applied — up to 33% in one case.  There is a
small cost in throughput (up to about 2% in one test, but usually much
lower) that comes with that improvement.  That is a cost that most mobile
users are likely to be willing to pay for that kind of battery-life
improvement.
<p>
Discussion of the patch set has mostly been focused on implementation
details so far, and there has not yet been input from the core scheduler
maintainers.  So there is no way to really know whether this approach has a
better chance of getting over the acceptance hurdle than its predecessors.
Given that it is relatively simple and the costs are only paid on
systems that benefit from this algorithm, though, one might expect that its
chances would be relatively good.  Acceptance would not unify the mainline
and Android schedulers, but it would be a big step in the right direction.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

For what it's worth, MediaTek has several <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/mediatek-decacore-heliox20-strategy,29398.html">ten</a>-<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/11166/mediatek-helio-x30-10-cores-on-10nm">core</a> mobile SoCs with three performance domains: fast A7x, medium speed A53, and efficient (slow) A53 or A35 cores.
<p>
Which makes virtually no difference to the article, not least because MediaTek have had difficulty selling these, so they're concentrating on the low end of the market where they can sell on value. So it's highly unlikely these chips will ever run the patch set in question.

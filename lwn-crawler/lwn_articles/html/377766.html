There have been nearly 1600 non-merge changesets incorporated into the mainline
kernel since <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/376508/">last week's
summary</a>; that makes a total of just over 6000 changesets for the
2.6.34-rc1 release.  Some of the most significant, user-visible changes merged
since last week include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Signal-handling semantics have been changed so that "synchronous"
     signals (SIGSEGV, for example) are delivered prior to asynchronous
     signals like SIGUSR1.  This fixes a problem where synchronous signal
     handlers could be invoked with the wrong context, something that
     apparently came up occasionally in WINE.  Users are unlikely to notice
     the change, but it is a slight semantics change that developers may
     want to be aware of.
<p>
<li> A new Nouveau driver with an incompatible interface has been merged;
     as of this writing, it will break all user-space code which worked
     with the older API.  See <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/377953/">this article</a> for more
     information on the Nouveau changes.  Nouveau also no longer needs
     external firmware for NV50-based cards.
<p>
<li> The direct rendering layer now supports "VGA switcheroo" on systems
     which provide more than one graphical processor.  For most needs, a
     simple, low-power GPU can be used, but the system can switch to the
     more power-hungry GPU when its features are needed.
<p>
<li> The <tt>umount()</tt> system call supports a new
     <tt>UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW</tt> flag which prevents the following of symbolic
     links.  Without this flag, local users who can perform unprivileged
     mounts can use a symbolic link to unmount arbitrary filesystems.
<p>
<li> The exofs filesystem (for object storage devices) has gained support
     for groups and for RAID0 striping.
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/234441/">LogFS</a> filesystem for
     solid-state storage devices has been merged.
<P>
<li> New drivers:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> <b>Media</b>: Wolfson Microelectronics WM8994 codecs, and
     	  Broadcom Crystal HD video decoders (staging).
     <p>
     <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>: Freescale MPC512x built-in DMA engines,
     	  Andigilog aSC7621 monitoring chips,
	  Analog Devices ADT7411 monitoring chips,
	  Maxim MAX7300 GPIO expanders,
	  HP Processor Clocking Control interfaces,
	  DT3155 Digitizers (staging),
	  Intel SCH GPIO controllers,
	  Intel Langwell APB Timers,
	  ST-Ericsson Nomadik/Ux500 I2C controllers,
	  Maxim Semiconductor MAX8925 power management ICs,
	  Max63xx watchdog timers,
	  Technologic TX-72xx watchdog timers, and
	  Hilscher NetX based fieldbus cards.
     </ul>

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> There has been a subtle change to the early boot code, wherein the 
     kernel will open the console device prior to switching to the root
     filesystem.  That eliminates problems where booting fails on a system
     with an empty <tt>/dev</tt> directory because the console device
     cannot be found, and eliminates the need to use devtmpfs in such
     situations.
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/365833/">kprobes jump</a>
     optimization patch has been merged.
<p>
<li> The <tt>write_inode()</tt> method in <tt>struct super_operations</tt>
     is now passed a pointer to the relevant <tt>writeback_control</tt>
     structure. 
<p>
<li> Two new helper functions - <tt>sysfs_create_files()</tt> and
     <tt>sysfs_remove_files()</tt> - ease the process of creating a whole
     array of attribute files.
<p>
<li> The <tt>show()</tt> and <tt>store()</tt> methods of <tt>struct
     class_attribute</tt> have seen a prototype change: the associated
     <tt>struct class_attribute</tt> pointer is now passed in.  A similar
     change has been made to <tt>struct sysdev_class_attribute</tt>.
<p>
<li> The <tt>sem</tt> lock found in <tt>struct device</tt> should no longer
     be accessed directly; instead, use <tt>device_lock()</tt> and
     <tt>device_unlock()</tt>. 

</ul>
<p>
At "only" 6000 changesets, 2.6.34 looks like a relatively calm
development cycle; both 2.6.32 and 2.6.33 had over 8000 changesets by the
time the -rc1 release came out.  It may be that there is less work to be
done, but it may also be that some trees got caught out in the cold by
Linus's decision to close the merge window early.  Linus suggested that he
might yet consider a few pull requests, so we might still see some new
features added to this kernel; stay tuned.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

That depends...  If root is dumb enough to mount/umount something in user-modifiable parts of tree with users present, you are screwed anyway, symlink attacks or no symlink attacks.  Just Don't Do It(tm), on any Unix.<br>
<p>
If you are allowing non-root mounts, you need to be damn careful; it *is* possible to get it right as it is.  Variant that doesn't follow symlinks makes some parts of that slightly easier; it's not a big simplification, but it makes sense and it is useful.<br>
<p>
Whether your suid-root mount wrapper of choice is getting it right or not is a separate question, of course - all software sucks and all such.<br>
<p>
It doesn't close any existing security holes (if nothing else, existing binaries behave as they used to) and it's not as if it was providing means for closing a hole that would be impossible to close without it.<br>
<p>
So whether you call that fixing a security hole or not is up to you.  Commit message is a bit too strong ("needed for" != "makes it easier to") and TFA is even stronger than that.  The former hadn't been too far over the top and I didn't feel like editing it.  As for the latter... questions to the article's author.<br>

Here begins the countdown to wankers splashing out in force, screaming "coverup" and "conspiracy"...<br>

Ah... I didn't realize this was talking about a suid-root wrapper for mount.  I misunderstood the 'users who are allowed to perform unprivileged mounts' and thought it was talking about some kernel setting to allow non-root users to call mount(2).<br>
<p>
So what this change really does is make it more straightforward to implement a secure suid-root wrapper for mount(2) in user space.<br>

I thought that's what it was as well. I know Miklos eventually wants to be able to have random users call mount() and umount() for their own FUSE filesystems on mount points they own without relying on a setuid wrapper.<br>

Coincidentally I was just musing last night about whether it would be possible to do something like this VGA switcheroo. There are two things I'm wondering though:<br>
<p>
To what extent is the unused device powered down? Are we looking at [near-]zero power consumption?<br>
<p>
Also, how do you get the monitor to work with both devices; surely this can't involved reconnecting the cable?<br>

VGA switching is mostly implemented on laptops to save power (for instance on some current generation MacBook pro models). Since there is no user-connectable video cable, reconnecting is not required. Seems the hardware is capable to connect the active GPU to the screen output.<br>
<p>
Seems this setup will be deprecated soon for the nVidia "Optimus" technology which allows a secondary GPU to render to the primary GPU's framebuffer without manual GPU switching.<br>

Thanks for the clarification - hopefully this will lead to extremely low idle power consumption for general purpose graphics cards within a few years' time. This is important to me as the idle power consumption is a major factor in the decision of what hardware to buy - much more than its peak power consumption given that 99% of the time I'm not pushing the card to its limit, but still need that limit to be high for the other 1%.<br>

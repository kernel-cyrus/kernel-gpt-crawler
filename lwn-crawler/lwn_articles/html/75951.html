<h1>Which is the real software suspend?</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
Laptop users may well have noticed that there are no less than three
competing software suspend implementations for the 2.6 kernel.  Two of them
(pmdisk and swsusp) are in the kernel itself; the third (<a
href="http://swsusp.sourceforge.net/">swsusp2</a>) is not, but is also the
implementation which has seen the most work over the last several months.
Unfortunately, none of these implementations could be said to be
production-level code.  It <i>is</i> possible to make a Linux system
suspend to disk and resume into something that still runs, but making it
work is not yet for the faint of heart.
<p>
The software suspend discussion began anew when Pavel Machek, the
maintainer of the in-kernel swsusp code,  <a
href="/Articles/75952/">asked</a> where things were going.  Pavel's
preference, not surprisingly, would be to remove the pmdisk code and stick
with swsusp.  Pavel is not alone in feeling this way.  The pmdisk
implementation is a fork of the swsusp code created by Patrick Mochel, who
was not enjoying good relations with Pavel at the time.  By some accounts, the pmdisk
code is better, but it suffers from a major problem: Patrick has gotten a
new job and has vanished from the kernel development world.  As a result,
pmdisk has seen no development work for several months, and it is a rare
user who can make it work reliably.  Unless Patrick surfaces and starts
working on the code again, it is likely to go away fairly soon.
<p>
The real question is what to do about swsusp2.  This version of the suspend
code has seen significant work by Nigel Cunningham and others.  It has
a number of features that others lack: the ability to abort a suspend
operation, a "nice display," compression of the saved image (which can
speed suspends and resumes on systems with slow disks), etc.  The real
difference, though, is that swsusp2 is, for many people, the only version
that works at all reliably.  So there is some real desire to see the
swsusp2 work merged into 2.6, and further development efforts concentrated
there.
<p>
The hangup seems to be the fact that the swsusp2 patch is large, and
it touches a great many core files.  Many of those changes are aimed at
making the "refrigerator" work better.  Before a system can be suspended,
all processes must be put into a quiet, known state.  This works by
setting a "freeze" flag and sending a signal to every process telling it to
put itself into the refrigerator.  Once all processes are nicely chilled, 
the system can save its state and suspend itself.
<p>

Processes will not refrigerate themselves immediately; they must first get
to a point where they hold no important resources.  Sometimes, a process
must get something from another process before it can be refrigerated; the
example that is often raised is a process waiting for a response from an
NFS server process.  If the NFS server is refrigerated first, the other
process will never get to where it can be frozen, and the suspend operation
will fail.  To avoid this sort of situation, the swsusp2 developers have
gone to great lengths to identify places where a process should not, yet, be
refrigerated.  The result is a great many macros with names like
<tt>SWSUSP_ACTIVITY_STARTING</tt> sprinkled widely though the code.  If
software suspend is not configured into the kernel, these macros simply
vanish, so the actual changes to the core kernel are smaller than a look at
a simple diffstat listing would indicate.  Swsusp2 remains a large patch,
however.
<p>

Nigel has offered to provide a version of swsusp2 which lacks the intrusive
refrigerator changes, though he warns that it will eventually become clear
that those changes are needed.  Andrew Morton has <a
href="/Articles/75971/">indicated</a> that this would be a step in the
right direction, but he is asking for more:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Even happier would be a series of small, well explained patches
	which bring swsusp into a final shape upon which more than one
	developer actually agrees.
	<p>
	These wholesale replacements and deletions are an indication that
	something has gone wrong with the development process here.
</div>
<p>
What clearly needs to happen is that the swsusp2 work needs to be broken
down into a long series of patches of the type that the kernel developers
like to see: small and focused.  That will be a significant effort, and
the swsusp2 developers appear to lack the time to do that anytime soon.
Now, perhaps, is the time for people who are concerned about a working
software suspend solution (which Linux really does need) to get together to
bring an end to the current, confused situation.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Pavel and I have since talked over IRC, and we're going to aim to merge Suspend2 into the kernel through a series of patches against Pavel's implementation, after which I will take over maintaining suspend to disk. This will take some time. My first draft of a plan looks like this:<p>1. Convert data to struct page pointers.<br>2. Extents infrastructure.<br>3. Convert data to extents.<br>4. Plugin infrastructure.<br>5. Split swap writing code and make a plugin.<br>6. Compression plugin.<br>7. Dynamic page flags infrastructure.<br>8. Memory pool infrastructure.<br>9. Split out image preparation.<br>10. Two pagesets support.<br>11. Proc interface infrastructure.<br>12. Swap file support.<br>13. HighMem support.<br>14. SMP support.<br>15. Nice user interface.<br>16. Freezer enhancements?<p>As you can see, it will take a while to merge the code, but this should be the end to the three versions problem. I'd also like to acknowledge the support of laclinux.com, who are in the process of donating an HT motherboard, CPU and memory so that I can actively maintain SMP and Highmem support.

      I've been wondering about setting this up on my laptop.  One caveat is<br>that I would like to have an encrypted swap partition when I move to 2.6.<br>Will the compression plugin support be through the cypto API?  Will this<br>allow encrypted suspend images?

      There isn't a CRYPTO api plugin for suspend2 at the moment, but you could make one :&gt;.<p>Suspend2 plugins work in a pipeline, so a crypto plugin could take compressed data, encrypt it and feed to the next plugin in the chain. It shouldn't be hard to implement, and people on the suspend list would certainly be willing to help.

      I haven't tried swsuspend2, but the current in-kernel implementations <br>don't do SMP.  I have a dual Opteron system as my desktop that it'd be <br>very nice to be able to suspend while I'm not using it. <br> <br>Duncan

      Suspend2 currently only supports SMP under 2.4 kernels. That should change shortly.

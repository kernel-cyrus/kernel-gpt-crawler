The <tt>FIEMAP</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command can be used to learn about how
a file's blocks are laid out on the disk.  It's useful for determining
fragmentation, optimizing boot-time readahead order, and a number of other
things.  One of those other things, though, has turned up bugs in how a
couple of important filesystems implement <tt>FIEMAP</tt>.
<p>
The <tt>cp</tt> application, it seems, has recently been taught to use
<tt>FIEMAP</tt> to find holes in files.  The idea is to optimize the
copying of such files by not even reading the holes; that way, the need to
zero-fill pages (in the kernel) and compare them against pages full of
zeros (in user space) can be eliminated.  It seems like a better way of
doing things.
<p>
Somewhere along the way, Chris Mason got word that <tt>cp</tt> was
corrupting files on btrfs filesystems.  The problem, naturally enough, was
that <tt>FIEMAP</tt> was reporting holes where none should exist.  The root
cause was that <tt>FIEMAP</tt> was not prepared to deal with regions of a
file which have been written to, but which do not actually have blocks
assigned yet.  The delayed allocation mechanism used by most contemporary
filesystems will create exactly that kind of situation, so this is not a
theoretical concern.
<p>
Chris <a href="/Articles/429347/">fixed the problem</a> for btrfs, then
decided to see how other filesystems handled the same situation.  From <a
href="/Articles/429349/">his report</a>, xfs handled things well, but ext4
had similar bugs in situations where delayed allocation and real holes came
together in the same file.  Certain types of bugs, it seems, are likely to
turn up in more than one context.
<p>
Chris's fix should get into 2.6.38 before the final release; chances are
good that an ext4 fix will be fast-tracked as well.  Expect stable kernel
backports too.  In the meantime, be careful when copying recently-written
files with new versions of <tt>cp</tt> on those filesystems.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks so much for posting this, I've been hitting this problem for the past few weeks and was totally puzzled. Now I see it correlates with when I installed coreutils 8.10.<br>

Been looking at the FIEMAP ioctl description in the kernel documentation. That should frighten away any user space folks thinking of using it. For a start it could define what an "extent" is.<br>
Anyway I have a different angle. Will FIEMAP work when a file is opened O_DIRECT? What about when the file is a partition or a disk (with or without O_DIRECT)? When a SCSI disk is opened O_DIRECT the FIEMAP ioctl could map through to the SCSI GET LBA STATUS command. Most likely I'm just dreaming.<br>

      An extent is a group of blocks in a file laid out contiguously on disk by the filesystem.  It's a filesystem concept, which is what is needed to answer your  questions.  <tt>O_DIRECT</tt> shouldn't change anything.  If your file descriptor is for a partition or a block device, there's no filesystem, so FIEMAP will make no sense.  And FIEMAP cannot possibly map to a low-level SCSI operation, since there is no filesystem knowledge at that level.

I have hacked raid5+xfs several years ago. from time to time I had this delayed allocation which was a huge headache. Question , can we prevent delayed allocation ?<br>

Delayed allocation is a really useful technique to (among other things) keep fragmentation down and increase the size of contiguous writes hitting the disk to something closer to the umpty-megabytes-at-once which the disk would actually prefer. It's better fixed than ripped out, I'd say.<br>

cp seems to be using FIEMAP on the src file to detect sparseness (i.e. holes) so it doesn't waste time reading potentially a lot of zeros. Unix already has good support for generating a sparse dst (unless dst is being overwritten). Next consider 'cp /dev/sda /dev/sdb' (don't try that at home) with unmapped (aka trimmed) blocks on /dev/sda . The SCSI GET LBA STATUS command on /dev/sda would play the same role as FIEMAP.<br>

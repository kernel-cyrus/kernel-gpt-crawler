<h1>IMA memory hog</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 20, 2010</br>
           </div>
Dave Chinner recently <a href="/Articles/410896/">noticed a problem</a> on
one of the kernel.org systems: the slab cache was using well over 2GB of
memory, mainly on radix tree nodes.  Intrigued, he looked further into the
problem.  It came down to the integrity measurement architecture (IMA)
security code, which uses the hardware TPM to help ensure that files on the
system have not been tampered with.  IMA, it seems, was using a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/175432/">radix tree</a> to store integrity
information, indexed by inode address.  Radix trees perform poorly with
sparse, unclustered keys, so IMA's usage was causing the creation of a
separate node for each inode in the system.  That added up to a lot of
memory.
<p>
A number of questions came after this revelation, including:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Why is IMA using such an inappropriate data structure?
<li> Why is it keeping all this information around even though it was
     disabled on the system in question?
<li> Why was IMA configured into the kernel in the first place?
</ol>
<p>
The answer to the first question seems to be that the IMA developers, as
part of the process of getting the code into the mainline, were not allowed
to expand the inode structure at all.  So they created a separate tree for
per-inode information; it just happens that they chose the wrong type of
tree and never noticed how poorly it performed.

</blockquote>
<p>
Question #2 is answered like this: the IMA code needs to keep track of
which files are opened for write access at any time.  There is no point in
measuring the integrity of files (checksumming them, essentially) when they
can be changed at any time.  Without tracking the state of all files all
the time, IMA can never know which files are opened for write access when
it first starts up.  The only way to be sure, it seems, is to track all
files starting at boot time just in case somebody tries to turn IMA on at some
point.
<p>
As for #3: kernel.org was running a Fedora kernel, and the Fedora folks
turned on the feature because it looked like it might be useful to some
people.  Nobody expected that it would have such an impact on systems where
it was not turned on.  Some participants in the discussion have given the
Fedora kernel maintainers some grief for not having audited the code before
enabling it, but auditing everything in the kernel to that level is a bit
larger task than Fedora can really be expected to take on.
<p>
Eric Paris has started work on slimming IMA down; his <a
href="/Articles/410902/">patches</a> work by moving the "open for write"
counts into the inode structure itself, eliminating the need to allocate
the separate IMA structures most of the time.  IMA is also shifted over to
a red-black tree when it does need to track those structures.  This work
eliminates almost all of the memory waste, but at the cost of growing the
inode structure slightly.  That does not sit well with everybody,
especially, it seems, those developers who feel that IMA should not exist
in the first place.  But it's a clear step in the right direction, so one
should expect something along these lines to be merged for 2.6.37.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Well, looking at the patches, it should be said that the inode structure growth is dependent on CONFIG_IMA, thus, if IMA is not enabled, the inode structure doesn't grow at all.<br>

      Yes but...distributors tend to turn on everything that looks like it might be useful for their users, so the chances of CONFIG_IMA being set are fairly good.

They should get rid of the whole lookup thing and add the info to the inode.<br>
If that would bloat the inode too much, perhaps give the inode a variable <br>
size (size determined at startup), or add a pointer to the IMA struct. But<br>
both seem too much complexity for no gain, just disable IMA except when<br>
you're actually using it. And then adding the info to the inode saves more<br>
memory because you don't have to keep around a whole extra tree. The IMA<br>
menuconfig text needs updating of course.<br>
<p>
As someone mentioned in the thread, things become simpler when IMA is only<br>
enabled or disabled at boot time, so no need to keep track of writers etc.<br>
when IMA is not used.<br>

people need to realize that the distros build their kernels so that no matter what feature someone tries to use, the kernel will support it.<br>
<p>
this frequently comes at a cost in startup time, runtime performance, or memory overhead. It's seldom this blatent an issue, but it's very common.<br>

      If you have a system where you can have 4 billion simultaneously open file descriptors, there might indeed be a problem.

      Yeah, see my <I>mea culpa</I> followup.  I had misinterpreted as "total writers ever" as opposed to "total concurrent writers".  I'm curious why they chose "long" for the count though.  Seems like even a fairly beefy 64-bit box might find (2<SUP>31</SUP>-1) active file descriptors a bit challenging, let alone (2<SUP>63</SUP>-1) on machines where <TT>sizeof(long)==8</TT>.  :-)

As a greybeard of 34, I first met C on a BBC B with a ROM chip that gave us a sort of halfhearted C (this was probably in 1988, or something, so pre-standardization in any case). 'short' was 8 bit, 'int' 16, 'long' 32. Borland's Turbo C gave me so much more memory that it felt like being let out of jail (until I used it all up, that is).<br>

Never mind... I see the decrement later.  Durrh.  I had misinterpreted the count as "number of times this file has ever been opened for writing", which doesn't actually seem like a useful thing to have.<br>

<h1>The bcachefs filesystem</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 25, 2015</br>
           </div>
The Linux kernel does not lack for filesystem support; many dozens of
filesystem implementations are available for one use case or another.  But,
after 
all these years, Linux arguably lacks an established "next-generation"
filesystem with advanced features and a design suited to contemporary
hardware.  That situation holds despite the existence of a number of
competitors for that title; Btrfs remains at the top of the list, but
others, such as tux3 and (still!) reiser4, are out there as well.  In each
case, it has taken rather longer than expected for the code to reach the
required level of maturity.  The list
of putative next-generation filesystems has just gotten longer with the
recent <a href="/Articles/655184/">announcement</a> of the "bcachefs"
filesystem.
<p>
Bcachefs is an extension of
bcache, which first <a href="/Articles/394672/">appeared</a> in LWN in
2010.  Bcache
was designed as a caching layer that improves block I/O performance by
using a fast solid-state drive as a cache for a (slower, larger) underlying
storage device. 
Bcache has been steadily developed over the last five years; it was merged
into the mainline kernel during the 3.10 development cycle in 2013.
<p>
Mainline bcache is <i>not</i> a filesystem; instead, it looks like a
special kind of block device.  It manages the movement of blocks of data
between fast and slow storage, working to ensure that the most frequently
used data is kept on the faster device.  This task is complex; bcache must
manage data in a way that yields high performance while ensuring that no
data is ever lost, 
even in the face of an unclean shutdown.  Even so, at its interface to the
rest of the system, bcache looks like a simple block device: give it
numbered blocks
of data, and it will store (and retrieve) them.
<p>
Users typically want something a bit higher-level than that; they want to
be able to organize blocks into files, and files into directory
hierarchies.  That task is handled by a filesystem like ext4 or Btrfs.
Thus, on current systems, bcache will be used in conjunction with a
filesystem layer to provide a complete solution.

</blockquote>
<p>
It seems that, over time, bcache has developed the potential to
provide filesystem functionality on its own.
In the bcachefs announcement, Kent Overstreet said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Well, years ago (going back to when I was still at Google), I and
	the other people working on bcache realized that what we were
	working on was, almost by accident, a good chunk of the
	functionality of a full blown filesystem - and there was a really
	clean and elegant design to be had there if we took it and ran with
	it.
</div>
<p>
The actual running with this idea appears to have happened relatively
recently, with the first publicly visible version of the bcachefs code
being <a
href="http://evilpiepirate.org/git/linux-bcache.git/commit/?h=bcache-dev&id=d16ce13a114e6d94dc2ddb01bee306be92315e32">committed</a>
to the bcache repository
in May 2015.  Since then, it has seen a steady stream of commits from Kent;
it was <a href="/Articles/655368/">announced</a> on the bcache mailing list
in mid-July, and on linux-kernel just over a month later.
<p>
With the bcachefs code added, bcache has gained the namespace and
file-management features that, until now, had to be supplied by a separate
filesystem layer.  Like Btrfs, it is a copy-on-write filesystem, meaning that
data is never overwritten.  Instead, a block that is overwritten moves to a
new location, with the older version persisting as long as any references
to it remain.  Copy-on-write works well on solid-state storage devices and
makes a number of advanced features relatively easy to implement.
<p>
Since the original bcache was a block-device management layer, bcachefs has
some strong features in this area.  Naturally, it offers multi-tier hybrid
caching of data, and is able to integrate multiple physical devices into a
single logical volume.  Bcachefs does not appear to have any sort of
higher-level RAID capability at this time, though; a basic replication
mechanism is "<q>like 80% done</q>".  Features like data checksumming
and compression are supported.
<p>
The plans for the future include filesystem features like snapshots — an
important Btrfs feature that is not yet available in bcachefs.  Kent listed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">erasure coding</a> as
well, presumably as an alternative to higher-level RAID support.  Native
support for <a href="/Articles/637035/">shingled magnetic recording
drives</a> is on the list, as is support for working with raw flash storage
directly.
<p>
But none of those features are present in bcachefs now; work has been
focused on getting the basic filesystem working in a reliable manner.
Performance tuning has not been a priority thus far, but the filesystem
claims reasonable performance numbers already — though, as Kent admitted,
it suffers from the common (to copy-on-write filesystems) problem of
"filling up" well before the underlying storage is actually filled with
data.  Importantly, the on-disk filesystem format has not yet been
finalized — a clear sign that a filesystem is not yet ready for real-world
use. 
<p>
Another important (though unlisted) missing feature is a filesystem
integrity checker ("fsck") utility.
<p>
Bcachefs looks like a promising filesystem, even if many of the intended
features have not yet been implemented.  But those who have watched
filesystem development for any period of time will know what comes next: a
surprisingly long wait while the code matures to the point that it can
actually be trusted for production workloads.  This process, it seems,
cannot be hurried beyond a certain point; that is why other next-generation
filesystem efforts are seemingly never quite ready.  The low-level
device-management code in bcachefs is tested and production-quality, but
the filesystem code lacks that pedigree.  Kent says that  it
"<q>won't be done in a month (or a year)<q>", but the truth is that
it may not be done for several years yet; that is how filesystem
development tends to go.
<p>
How many years depends, of course, on how many people test the filesystem
and how much development effort it gets.  Currently it has a development
community of one — Kent — and he has noted that his full-time attention is
"<q>only going to last as long as my interest and my savings account
hold out</q>".  If bcachefs acquires both a commercial sponsor and a
wider development community, it may yet develop into that mature next-generation
filesystem that we seem to never quite get (though Btrfs is there by some
accounts).  Until that happens, it should probably be looked at as an
interesting idea with some advanced proof-of-concept code.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

On reading this article, I can't help but wonder whatever happened to Btrfs. There seem to have been no progress updates on it ever since a lot of Btrfs developers joined Facebook. I've heard about good work being done internally, though.<br>
<p>
bcachefs seems to be at the exact same place that Btrfs was in 2008. A somewhat-working filesystem with great potential that aims to be the next-gen FS with features that ZFS has had for almost a decade now. It would be a tragedy if we had to wait till 2020 only to hear that this filesystem ran out of steam too.<br>

BTRFS is in its stabilization phase. The authors are hard at working improving it, and the tools around it. You can see the filesystem site (<a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page</a>) for recent progress. <br>

I am probably talking BS here, but it seems there are two layers: blocks and files.<br>
Could we not separate both somehow? The block management part could be like bcache, and could be chosen differently based on HDD, SSD, whatever is coming next. The file management could be based on ext4 and be more generic.<br>

You may find the idea of "Nameless Writes" interesting: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/fast12/tech/full_papers/Zhang.pdf">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/fast12/tech/full_pape...</a><br>
<p>
The idea is that they allow decoupling the *extent allocation policy* from the filesystem, without going all the way to complicated object-storage schemes.<br>
<p>
They are, largely, best-suited for COW - however, given a single location that accepts in-place writes, one can build an entire filesystem using nothing but nameless writes and updating that location to point to the most-recent root extent.<br>

Probably the most succinct summary of the behavior of "nameless writes" I've found is "malloc-with-data" - you have some data, and you say "Store this somewhere, and then give me a pointer to it."<br>

From there, it's an exercise in persistent data structures.<br>

Slightly related, but that how layering in ZFS works. You have lower layer caring about block allocation, check summing, duplication etc. On top of that you can plug different upper layers. There is one giving you filesystems interface (ZFS Posix Layer). There is another giving you block devices suitable for swap and mkfs'ing other filesystems.<br>

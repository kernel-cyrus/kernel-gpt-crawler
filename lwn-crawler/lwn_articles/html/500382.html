<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 5, 2012</br>
           </div>
Last November LWN looked at the <a href="/Articles/468896/">volatile ranges
patch set</a> from John Stultz.  This patch is intended to bring an Android
feature into the mainline, but it is a reimplemented feature that is more
deeply tied into the memory management subsystem.  That patch has now
returned, but the API has changed so another look is warranted.
<p>
A "volatile range" is a set of pages in memory containing data that might
be useful to an application at some point in the future; a key point is
that, if the need arises, the application is able to reacquire (or
regenerate) that data from another source.  A web browser's in-RAM image
cache is a classic example.  Keeping the images around can reduce net
traffic and improve page rendering times, but, should the cached images
vanish, the browser can request a new copy from the source.  Thus, while it
makes sense to keep this data around, it also makes sense to get rid of it
if a more pressing need for memory arises.
<p>
If the kernel knew about this sort of cached data, it could dump that data
during times of memory stress and quickly reclaim the underlying memory.
In such a situation, applications could cache more data than they otherwise
would, knowing that there are limits to how much that caching can affect
the system as a whole.  The result would be better utilization of memory
and a system that performs better overall.
<p>
Google's Robert Love implemented such a mechanism for Android as "ashmem."
There is a 
desire to get the ashmem functionality into the mainline kernel, but the
implementation and API were not to everybody's taste.  To get around that
problem, John took the core ashmem code, reworked the virtual memory
integration, and hooked it into the <tt>posix_fadvise()</tt> system call;
that is the version of the patch that was described last November.
<p>
Dave Chinner subsequently pointed out that this functionality might be
better suited to the <tt>fallocate()</tt> system call.  That call looks
like this:
<p>
<pre>
    int fallocate(int fd, int mode, off_t offset, off_t len);
</pre>
<p>
This system call is meant to operate on ranges of data within a file.  Of
particular interest, perhaps, is the <tt>FALLOCATE_FL_PUNCH_HOLE</tt>
operation, which removes a block of data from an arbitrary location within
a file.  Declaring a volatile range can be thought of as a form of hole
punching, but with a kernel-determined delay.  If memory is tight, the hole
could be punched immediately; otherwise the operation could complete at
some later time, or not at all.  Given the similarity between these two
operations, it made sense to implement them within the same system call;
John duly reworked the patch along those lines.
<p>
With the <a href="/Articles/498894/">new patch set</a>, to declare that a range of a file's contents is
volatile, an application would call:
<p>
<pre>
    fallocate(fd, FALLOCATE_FL_MARK_VOLATILE, offset, len);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>offset</tt> and <tt>len</tt> describe the actual range to be
marked.  After the call completes, the kernel is not obligated to keep that
range in memory, and is not obligated to write that range to backing store
before reclaiming it.  The application should not attempt to access that
portion of the file while it has been marked volatile, since the contents
could disappear at any time.  Instead, if and when the data turns out to be
useful, a call should be made to:
<p>
<pre>
    fallocate(fd, FALLOCATE_FL_UNMARK_VOLATILE, offset, len);
</pre>
<p>
If the indicated range is still present in memory, the call will return
zero and the application can proceed to work with the data.  If, instead,
any part of the range has been purged by the kernel since it was marked
volatile, a non-zero return value will inform the application that it needs
to find that data somewhere else.
<p>
Any filesystem could conceivably implement this functionality, but, in
practice, it only makes sense for a RAM-based filesystem like tmpfs, so it
is only implemented there.
<p>
The patch is in its third revision as of this writing, having gotten a
number of comments in its first two iterations.  The number of complaints
has fallen off considerably, though, suggesting that most reviewers are
happy now.  So this feature may just find its way into the 3.6 kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Err. Its not clear to me what you mean by pin/unpin.  But you can mark a large space as volatile, and then unmark individual pages (basically breaking the large range into smaller fragments).<br>

"Any filesystem could conceivably implement this functionality, but, in practice, it only makes sense for a RAM-based filesystem like tmpfs, so it is only implemented there."<br>
<p>
So, for the stated example, the web browser would have to:<br>
<p>
1. Find a mounted ram-based filesystem it had access to.<br>
2. Create a file for the cache.<br>
3. Presumably mmap() the file so  it can be accessed conveniently.<br>
<p>
?<br>
<p>
Also, how would the application know when an area had been reclaimed? Canaries? What if an application tried to access an object that had only partially been reclaimed - say a single 4k page had innocuously been taken from a huge blob?<br>

to answer your second issue (how would it know that it's been reclaimed), per the article, the application does<br>
<p>
    fallocate(fd, FALLOCATE_FL_UNMARK_VOLATILE, offset, len);<br>
<p>
and if the return code is 0, it can use the data, if the return code is non-zero, some part of the data has been reclaimed and the application needs to regenerate it.<br>
<p>
I would hope that when the system grabs part of a block that's been marked volatile, it grabs the entire block, rather then just punching a small hole in it (or at least remembers what it damaged earlier when it needs more memory, on the theory that you may mark a large block volitile and then try to re-use small chunks of it)<br>

I can't speak for Google, but I have a patch I'll be sending out in my next iteration that removes the ashmem unpinned range management code and replaces it with fallocate() calls (killing ~320 lines in ashmem).<br>
<p>
Ashmem also serves a separate purpose to Android, which is to provide a way to create atomically unlinked tmpfs files that can be shared between applications. This avoids having applications accidentally leave tmpfs files that take memory even if on one is using them.<br>
<p>
For this purpose, the ashmem driver still is useful, but can be submitted and reviewed independently without tangling the pin/unpin functionality into the discussion.<br>

<p>
So why wouldn't volatile data, be useful on disk files systems with directories like /var/cache?   It seems to me to be a useful response to "FS full" conditions rather than return ENOSPACE to some (important) application writing to /var/spool.  Similarly perhaps a Desktop Environment, might like to implement a "Recycle Bin" for deleted files marking them as volatile.  If FS atimes are respected when choosing what to reclaim, then the kernel can actually do a rough LRU policy.  But I guess that would be just TOO convenient and useful to applicaton programmers, so we'll just tell everyone to re-implement time stamping and cache management, over and over, rather than provide a simple to use reuseable feature.<br>
<p>
Balkanised features for swap &amp; block device backed filesystems, introduce finicky requirements infecting applications with implementation specifics, remember fsync() issues?  "What do you mean, the filesystem can't efficiently sync the contents of this 1 tiny file?"<br>

I think that's not really useful in its current way. Instead, this should be part of the madvise() family, and work on anonymous memory as well. <br>

Otherwise, making it useable for applications is basically almost impossible.<br>

/tmp might or might not be tmpfs, /dev/shm is tmpfs.  Mapping a shared memory region with shm_open and mmap, and then shm_unlinking it, should make it indistinguishable from anonymous memory.  Right?  <br>

      Sure, but this API is a really convoluted and irritating way to make users go about things..<br>
<br>
Consider the two options (note: code written in comment editor, may not actually work; error handling omitted):<br>
<br>
Option 1:
<pre>
volatile_storage = mmap(0, 163840, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE, 0, 0);
</pre>

API option 2, retardedly difficult for no good reason:
<pre>
int fd = -1;
char *name;
while (fd == -1) {
  name = tmpnam(NULL);
  fd = shm_open(name, O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_RDWR, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
}
shm_unlink(name);
ftruncate(fd, 163840);
volatile_storage = mmap(NULL, 163840, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
</pre>


Then, the usage is ridiculous too:
Sane API:
<pre>
madvise(object_addr, 4096, MADV_VOLATILE);
</pre>

Insane API:
<pre>
// First implement a function "find_mapping_info_for" which does e.g. a binary
// search through a list of shm_open'd regions, to find one that contains the
// address in question. Then...
mapping_info = find_mapping_info_for(object_addr);
fallocate(mapping_info.fd, FALLOCATE_FL_MARK_VOLATILE, object_addr - mapping_info.base_addr, 4096);
</pre>

Why would anyone want the second API?...it basically requires users to go through an extra song-and-dance at mmap time, to keep extra file descriptors open, and to track which file descriptors belong to which memory regions, for seemingly no reason.

It seems like anonymous mmap might as well be implemented using shm under the covers.  Maybe it is.<br>
<p>
The sample code looks plausible, but you omitted code to check whether backing store for an address range has been reclaimed.  Actually we don't need a new flag; MADV_MREMOVE suffices.  The docs don't say what the process would find in an MREMOVEd page, were it to look, or what marking a previously MREMOVEd range MADV_NORMAL does.  Mark it MADV_NORMAL to be see if everything written is still there.  If that fails,  check progressively smaller ranges.  Or unmap the lot and forget all about it. Or mark it DONTNEED, equivalent to munmapping and re-mmapping the address range.<br>

So I moved from madvise to fadvise early on because the need to be able to coordinate shared volatile ranges between processes, in the fashion ashmem provides.<br>
<p>
That said, once the backing infrastructure for fallocate() volatile regions is upstream, there isn't a reason why a simpler madvise interface wouldn't also be viable.<br>
<p>
I'd invite you to join the discussion on lkml to further discuss this.<br>

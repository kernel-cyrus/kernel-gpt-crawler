<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>January 21, 2015</br>
           </div>
<p>
Last March, we <a href="/Articles/589260/">looked</a> at a proposal for a
new <tt>fallocate()</tt> option to collapse a range of blocks within a
file.  The <tt>FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE</tt> flag was added to the 3.15
kernel; its counterpart, <tt>FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE</tt>, has been
<a href="/Articles/629365/">proposed</a> by the same developer: Namjae Jeon.  It would provide a way to
open up a range of blocks within a 
file, without requiring an expensive data copy.
</p>

<p>
The example use case that Jeon has used for both new flags is
the removal (using <tt>FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE</tt>) or insertion (using <tt>FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE</tt>) of advertisements
into large 
video files.  While that particular example may not resonate with everyone,
there are other uses for quickly removing and inserting chunks of data in the
middle of large files.  For example, doing non-linear editing on various
types of media (video, in particular) may benefit from reducing the amount
of data copying needed.  The requirement
that the ranges be block-aligned, 
though, could limit the overall usefulness of both flags.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html"><tt>fallocate()</tt></a>  
system call provides a means for programmers to alter the allocation of
blocks for a file—essentially to give the filesystem more information about
the programmer's plans for the file so that better allocation decisions
can be made. Over time, additional features have been added to
<tt>fallocate()</tt>, including
the ability to punch holes in or to zero-out ranges of a file.
</p>

<p>
There are quite a few similarities between <tt>FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE</tt>
and <tt>FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE</tt>.  Both must be the only flag passed
to <tt>fallocate()</tt> (other options allow ORing in multiple flags),
require that the offset and length specified are multiples of the
filesystem's logical block size, and both are only implemented for the XFS
and extent-based ext4 filesystems.  Also, they are restricted to working
within the existing file, so the range covered by offset&nbsp;+&nbsp;length must
not stretch beyond the current end of file (EOF).
</p>

<p>
For inserting a range, the basic algorithm is the same for both XFS and
ext4.  Once the offset and length parameters are validated
(i.e. block-aligned and not past EOF), the file size is
increased by the length.  The extent containing the logical block number
for offset is then examined to see if that block number is the first in the
extent.  If not, the extent is split so that it starts with the block number
corresponding to offset.  Then, starting with that extent, all extents from
there to the EOF are
shifted over (i.e. to the right) by the length, which leaves behind a hole
located 
at the offset with the specified length.
</p>

<p>
Once that is done, callers can fill that hole by writing whatever data they
want into it—hopefully not just ads.  Reading from that region before
writing to it will return zeroes, as with other holes punched in files.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the changes to the kernel filesystem layer (which are minimal), XFS,
and ext4 (which are more extensive), Jeon has also added a number of test
cases to xfstests.  There 
are simple tests of the insert range feature, as well as more complicated
tests that do multiple inserts or inserts coupled with collapse
operations to try to stress 
both of these features.  In addition, he has added support for an "finsert"
command to the <tt>xfs_io</tt> program from <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=xfs/cmds/xfsprogs.git;a=summary">xfsprogs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Jeon's patch set is up to version 8 at this point; there have been lots of
suggestions for changes along the way, but little in the way of fundamental
opposition.  Given that the collapse range capability was added, it would
seem likely that insert range will follow along before too long.

I have always been wondering why these types of operations are only appearing now, to me they seem very useful.<br>
Video editing is a an obvious example, but there are also uses for plenty other applications. E.g. in scientific environments the need to put something into the middle of a large files comes up often.<br>
Many commonly used data formats allow for padding between logical sections so that block alignment requirement is not a big problem.<br>
<p>
What I'd still love now is a way to dump one file into a newly created hole in another file without needing any copies. Though I assume this is probably tricky as it would depend on capabilities of the filesystem, e.g. whether it can do copy-on-write or or not.<br>

<p>
I feel like this implementation is unlikely to gain much traction in any but the most specialised of environments, because the abstraction leaks too badly.<br>
<p>
The requirement for an application to understand things like the block size of the underlying filesystem seems like a textbook example of unwarranted chumminess with the implementation, and I'm honestly surprised the feature hasn't seen more pushback, especially with the experience of things like fanotify where a feature was added with the appearance of being conceptually general-purpose but actually specific shortcomings that limit it to a handful of use cases.<br>

I can already see one immediate use for this: FLAC currently zero-fills a large (about 8KiB) chunk at the start of each file "just in case" you want to add more metadata without reallocating the entire file (which may be hundreds of megabytes). It's large enough to be wasteful for small text edits and too small to be useful for album art; with the filesystem feature it wouldn't need to waste the space at all.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;with the filesystem feature it wouldn't need to waste the space at all</font><br>
<p>
But FLAC can't know at creation time that the metadata will only ever be edited on a filesystem/OS combo that supports this feature, so it's unlikely to make the assumption that the pre-allocation is not needed.<br>
<p>
This is a part of what it means to be too specialised: entirely non-portable, relying on assumptions that can be broken by moving a file even within one system. That doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, and it's not that I think this is a *bad* feature, just that in practice it will have to be used transparently and opportunistically as an internal operation, and probably by applications that either don't produce an output file, or already have a final 'rendering' pass or similar, where they can take the opportunity to defragment the result while they're at it.<br>
<p>
If it didn't rely on the ability to safely leave small holes in the final files, it would be a lot easier for programs to use the API opportunistically where supported, but since it's not transparent I believe those opportunities will be few and far between.<br>

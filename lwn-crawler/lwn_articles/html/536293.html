<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 6, 2013</br>
           </div>
The kernel's "IDR" layer is a curious beast.  Its job is conceptually
simple: it is charged with the allocation of integer ID numbers used with
device names, POSIX timers, and more.  The implementation is somewhat less
than simple, though, for a straightforward reason: IDR functions are often
called from performance-critical code paths and must be able to work in
atomic context.  These constraints, plus some creative programming, have
led to one of the stranger subsystem APIs in the kernel.  If Tejun Heo has
his way, though, things will become rather less strange in the future —
though at least one reviewer disagrees with that conclusion.
<p>
Strangeness notwithstanding, the IDR API has changed little since it was <a
href="/Articles/103209/">documented</a> here in 2004.  One includes
<tt>&lt;linux/idr.h&gt;</tt>, allocates an <tt>idr</tt> structure, and
initializes it with <tt>idr_init()</tt>.  Thereafter, allocating a new
integer ID and binding it to an internal structure is a matter of calling
these two functions: 
<p>
<pre>
    int idr_pre_get(struct idr *idp, gfp_t gfp_mask);
    int idr_get_new(struct idr *idp, void *ptr, int *id);
</pre>
<p>
The call to <tt>idr_pre_get()</tt> should happen outside of atomic context;
its purpose is to perform all the memory allocations necessary to ensure
that the following call to <tt>idr_get_new()</tt> (which returns the newly
allocated ID number and associates it with the given <tt>ptr</tt>) is able
to succeed.  The 
latter call can then happen in atomic context, a feature needed by many IDR
users.
<p>
There is just one little problem with this interface, as Tejun points out
in <a href="/Articles/536019/">the introduction to his patch set</a>: the
call to <tt>idr_get_new()</tt> can still fail.  So code using the IDR layer
cannot just ask for a new ID; it must, instead, execute a loop that retries
the allocation until it either succeeds or returns a failure code other than
<tt>-EAGAIN</tt>.  That leads to the inclusion of a lot of
error-prone boilerplate code in well over 100 call sites in the kernel; the
2004 article and Tejun's patch both contain 
examples of what this code looks like.
<p>
Failure can happen for a number of reasons, but the mostly likely cause is
tied to the fact that the memory preallocated by <tt>idr_pre_get()</tt> is
a global resource.  A call to <tt>idr_pre_get()</tt> simply ensures that a
minimal amount of memory is available; calling it twice will not increase
the amount of preallocated memory.  So, if two processors simultaneously call
<tt>idr_pre_get()</tt>, the amount of memory allocated will be the same as
if only one processor had made that call.  The first processor to call
<tt>idr_get_new()</tt> may then consume all of that memory, leaving nothing
for the second caller.  That second caller will then be forced to drop out
of atomic context and execute
the retry loop — a code path that is unlikely to have been well tested by
the original developer.
<p>
Tejun's response is to change the API, basing it on three new functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void idr_preload(gfp_t gfp_mask);
    int idr_alloc(struct idr *idp, void *ptr, int start, int end, gfp_t gfp_mask);
    void idr_preload_end(void);
</pre>
<p>
As with <tt>idr_pre_get()</tt>, the new <tt>idr_preload()</tt> function is
charged with allocating the memory necessary to satisfy the next allocation
request.  There are some interesting differences, though.  The attentive
reader will note that there is no <tt>struct&nbsp;idr</tt> argument to
<tt>idr_preload()</tt>, 
suggesting that the preallocated memory is not associated with any
particular ID number space.  It is, instead, stored in a single per-CPU
array.  Since this memory is allocated for the current CPU, it is not
possible for any other processor to slip in and steal it — at least, not if
the current thread is not preempted.  For that reason,
<tt>idr_preload()</tt> also disables preemption.  Given that, the existence
of the new <tt>idr_preload_end()</tt> function is easy to explain: it is
there to re-enable preemption once the allocation has been performed.
<p>
A call to <tt>idr_alloc()</tt> will actually allocate an integer ID.  It
accepts upper and lower bounds for that ID to accommodate  code that can
only cope with 
a given range of numbers — code that uses the ID as an array index, for
example.  If need be, it will attempt to allocate memory using the given
<tt>gfp_mask</tt>.  Allocations will be unnecessary if
<tt>idr_preload()</tt> has been called, but, with the new interface,
preallocation is no longer necessary.  So code that can call
<tt>idr_alloc()</tt> from process context can dispense with the
<tt>idr_preload()</tt> and <tt>idr_preload_end()</tt> calls altogether.
Either way, the only way 
<tt>idr_alloc()</tt> will fail is with a hard memory allocation failure;
there is no longer any need to put a loop around allocation attempts.  As a
result, Tejun's 62-part patch set, touching 78 files, results in the net
deletion of a few hundred lines of code.
<p>

Most of the developers whose code was changed by Tejun's patch set
responded with simple <tt>Acked-by</tt> lines.  Eric Biederman, though, <a
href="/Articles/536352/">didn't like the API</a>; he said "<q>When
reading code with idr_preload I get this deep down creepy feeling.  What is
this magic that is going on?</q>"  As can be seen in <a
href="/Articles/536353/">Tejun's response</a>, one developer's magic is
another's straightforward per-CPU technique.  As of this writing, that
particular discussion has not reached any sort of public resolution.  Your
editor would predict, though, that the simplification of this heavily-used
API will be sufficiently compelling that most developers will be able to
get past any resulting creepy feelings.  So the IDR API may be changing in
a mainline kernel in the not-too-distant future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      IDR has to allocate memory <i>for IDR's internal record keeping</i>; there is a radix-tree like structure for fast lookups and traversal.  The caller doesn't (and shouldn't) know about that structure, so it cannot allocate it.

Second (stupid?) question : why not provide the second call a reference to the allocated memory from the first one ? And forget the preemption deactivation dance that some (RT people) dislike ?<br>

      Not stupid.  The relevant code is (usually) about to go under spinlock anyway, so the preemption disable isn't as big a deal as it could be.  An API like you suggest could maybe work; one could also maybe split it into:
<p>
<pre>
    id = idr_allocate_id(gfp_flags);  /* non-atomic context */
    idr_assign_id(id, pointer); /* Can be atomic */
</pre>
<p>
That would handle the atomic association of the ID with the pointer while under lock without per-CPU stuff, but would require the IDR library to manage assigned-but-not-active IDs.  With either this idea or yours, there would also have to be an <tt>idr_never_mind()</tt> function to back things out if need be.

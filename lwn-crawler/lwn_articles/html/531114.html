           By <b>Michael Kerrisk</b><br>January 4, 2013</br>
           </div>
<p> The Linux 3.8 merge window saw the acceptance of Eric Biederman's
sizeable series of <a href="/Articles/528078/">user namespace and related
patches</a>.  Although there remain some details to finish&mdash;for
example, a number of Linux filesystems are not yet user-namespace
aware&mdash;the implementation of user namespaces is now functionally
complete.

<p> The completion of the user namespaces work is something of a milestone,
for a number of reasons.  First, this work represents the completion of 
one of the most complex namespace implementations to date, as evidenced by the fact
that it has been around five years since the first steps in the
implementation of user namespaces (in Linux 2.6.23).  Second, the namespace
work is currently at something of a "stable point", with the implementation
of most of the existing namespaces being more or less complete.  This does
not mean that work on namespaces has finished: other namespaces may be
added in the future, and there will probably be further extensions to
existing namespaces, such as the addition of <a
href="/Articles/527342/">namespace isolation for the kernel log</a>.
Finally, the recent changes in the implementation of user namespaces are
something of a game changer in terms of how namespaces can be used:
starting with Linux 3.8, unprivileged processes can create user namespaces
in which they have full privileges, which in turn allows any other type of
namespace to be created inside a user namespace.

<p> Thus, the present moment seems a good point to take an overview of
namespaces and a practical look at the namespace API. This is the first of
a series of articles that does so: in this article, we provide an overview
of the currently available namespaces; in the follow-on articles, we'll
show how the namespace APIs can be used in programs.


<h4>The namespaces</h4>

<p> Currently, Linux implements six different types of namespaces.  The purpose of each
namespace is to wrap a particular global system resource in an abstraction
that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have
their own isolated instance of the global resource. One of the overall
goals of namespaces is to support the implementation of <a
href="/Articles/524952/">containers</a>, a tool for lightweight
virtualization (as well as other purposes) that provides a group of
processes with the illusion that they are the only processes on the
system.

<!--
For some of the namespaces, there is a hierarchical (parent-child)
relationship between all instances of the namespace, so that a process may
be a member of multiple instances of a particular type of namespace.
-->

<p> In the discussion below, we present the namespaces in the order that
they were implemented (or at least, the order in which the implementations
were completed).  The <tt>CLONE_NEW*</tt> identifiers listed in parentheses
are the names of the constants used to identify namespace types when
employing the namespace-related APIs (<tt>clone()</tt>, <tt>unshare()</tt>,
and <tt>setns()</tt>) that we will describe in our follow-on articles.

<p>

<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/namespaces.php3">Mount
namespaces</a> (<tt>CLONE_NEWNS</tt>, Linux 2.4.19) isolate the set of filesystem mount points seen by a group of
processes. Thus, processes in different mount namespaces can have different
views of the filesystem hierarchy. With the addition of mount namespaces,
the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html"><tt>mount()</tt></a>
and <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umount.2.html"><tt>umount()</tt></a>
system calls ceased operating on a global set of mount points visible to
all processes on the system and instead performed operations that affected
just the mount namespace associated with the calling process.

<p> One use of mount namespaces is to create environments that are similar
to chroot jails. However, by contrast with
the use of the <tt>chroot()</tt> system call, mount namespaces are a more
secure and flexible tool for this task. Other <a
href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-mount-namespaces/index.html">more
sophisticated uses</a> of mount namespaces are also possible. For example,
separate mount namespaces can be set up in a master-slave relationship, so
that the mount events are automatically propagated from one namespace to
another; this allows, for example, an optical disk device that is mounted
in one namespace to automatically appear in other namespaces.

<p> Mount namespaces were the first type of namespace to be implemented on
Linux, appearing in 2002. This fact accounts for the rather generic "NEWNS"
moniker (short for "new namespace"): at that time no one seems to have been
thinking that other, different types of namespace might be needed in the
future.


<p> <a href="/Articles/179345/">UTS namespaces</a> (<tt>CLONE_NEWUTS</tt>,
Linux 2.6.19) isolate two system identifiers&mdash;<tt>nodename</tt> and
<tt>domainname</tt>&mdash;returned by the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/uname.2.html"><tt>uname()</tt></a>
system call; the names are set using the <tt>sethostname()</tt> and
<tt>setdomainname()</tt> system calls.

In the context of containers, the UTS namespaces feature allows each
container to have its own hostname and NIS domain name. This can be useful
for initialization and configuration scripts that tailor their actions
based on these names.

The term "UTS" derives from the name of the structure passed to the
<tt>uname()</tt> system call: <tt>struct utsname</tt>. The name of that
structure in turn derives from "UNIX Time-sharing System".


<p> <a href="/Articles/187274/">IPC namespaces</a> (<tt>CLONE_NEWIPC</tt>,
Linux 2.6.19) isolate certain interprocess communication (IPC) resources,
namely, <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man7/svipc.7.html">System
V IPC</a> objects and (since Linux 2.6.30) <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man7/mq_overview.7.html">POSIX
message queues</a>. The common characteristic of these IPC mechanisms is
that IPC objects are identified by mechanisms other than filesystem
pathnames.  Each IPC namespace has its own set of System V IPC identifiers
and its own POSIX message queue filesystem.

<p> <a href="/Articles/259217/">PID namespaces</a> (<tt>CLONE_NEWPID</tt>,
Linux 2.6.24) isolate the process ID number space. In other words,
processes in different PID namespaces can have the same PID. One of the
main benefits of PID namespaces is that containers can be migrated
between hosts while keeping the same process IDs for the processes inside
the container. PID namespaces also allow each container to have its own
<tt>init</tt> (PID 1), the "ancestor of all processes" that manages various
system initialization tasks and reaps orphaned child processes when they
terminate.

<p> From the point of view of a particular PID namespace instance, a
process has two PIDs: the PID inside the namespace, and the PID outside the
namespace on the host system. PID namespaces can be nested: a process will
have one PID for each of the layers of the hierarchy starting from the PID
namespace in which it resides through to the root PID namespace. A process
can see (e.g., <strike>view via <tt>/proc/</tt><i>PID</i> and</strike> send
signals with <tt>kill()</tt>) only processes contained in its own PID
namespace and the namespaces nested below that PID namespace.


<p> <a href="/Articles/219794/">Network namespaces</a>
(<tt>CLONE_NEWNET</tt>, started in Linux <strike>2.4.19</strike> 2.6.24 and largely completed by
about Linux 2.6.29) provide isolation of the system resources associated
with networking. Thus, each network namespace has its own network devices, IP
addresses, IP routing tables, <tt>/proc/net</tt> directory, port numbers,
and so on.

<p>Network namespaces make containers useful from a networking perspective:
each container can have its own (virtual) network device and its own
applications that bind to the per-namespace port number space; suitable
routing rules in the host system can direct network packets to the network
device associated with a specific container. Thus, for example, it is
possible to have multiple containerized web servers on the same host
system, with each server bound to port 80 in its (per-container) network
namespace.



<p> <a href="/Articles/528078/">User namespaces</a>
(<tt>CLONE_NEWUSER</tt>, started in Linux 2.6.23 and completed in Linux
3.8) isolate the user and group ID number spaces. In other words, a
process's user and group IDs can be different inside and outside a user
namespace. The most interesting case here is that a process can have a
normal unprivileged user ID outside a user namespace while at the same time
having a user ID of 0 inside the namespace. This means that the process has
full root privileges for operations inside the user namespace, but is
unprivileged for operations outside the namespace. 

<P> Starting in Linux 3.8, unprivileged processes can
create user namespaces, which opens up a raft of interesting new
possibilities for applications: since an otherwise unprivileged process can
hold root privileges inside the user namespace, unprivileged applications
now have access to functionality that was formerly limited to
root. Eric Biederman has put a lot of effort into making the user
namespaces implementation safe and correct. However, the changes wrought by
this work are subtle and wide ranging. Thus, it may happen that user
namespaces have some as-yet unknown security issues that remain to be found
and fixed in the future.



<h4>Concluding remarks</h4>

<p> It's now around a decade since the implementation of the first Linux
namespace. Since that time, the namespace concept has expanded into a more
general framework for isolating a range of global resources whose scope was
formerly system-wide. As a result, namespaces now provide the basis for a
complete lightweight virtualization system, in the form of containers.  As
the namespace concept has expanded, the associated API has grown&mdash;from
a single system call (<tt>clone()</tt>) and one or two <tt>/proc</tt>
files&mdash;to include a number of other system calls and many more files
under <tt>/proc</tt>. The details of that API will form the subject of the
follow-ups to this article.

I though you were asking about how the controls interact with the namespaces at the implementation level of objects, and at that level they are orgothogonal.<br>
<p>
As for taking a slice of a control group hierarchy and making it visible in a container the best practical solution I have heard is to do a "mount --bind" of a slice of that hierarchy into a container.  Something better was promised at the time control groups were merged but that has never appeared.<br>
<p>
The design mistake of embedding a view of the system packed with global identifiers and silly unwarranted assumptions into a filesystem seems to be an easy mistake to make and is very annoying to deal with.<br>
<p>
From what little time I have had to look at the control group interface to user space, and the control group model of controlling resources, and the direction all of that is evolving I really don't like the result.  Still today control groups are the best solution we have in linux today to the recursive resource limiting problem.<br>
<p>
I encourage people who care to help by looking at control groups, reporting bugs and usability problems, and even better writing and submitting patches.<br>

What is not clear to me is if the network namespaces also abstracts the firewall; e.g. is it possible to have separate firewall rules in each of the network namespaces or is OpenVZ still needed for that ?<br>

      <p>I believe you can have separate iptables rules in each namespace.  I'm running an LXC container and it has it's own view of iptables separate from the host system.

Doing this for a firewall would get messy -- a firewall thinks about packets, not endpoints.<br>
<p>
If the kernel had programmable policy for what tasks could listen, accept, and connect on which sockets to which endpoints, on the other hand, firewalls could (on non-routers, anyway) go away and everything would get simpler and faster.<br>
<p>
And no, selinux doesn't count in my book.  Try actually programming the policy.<br>

Each network namespace is a logically a separate networking stack, with separate addresses, separate firewall rules, separate qos policies etc.<br>

Network devices and sockets belong to a particular network namespace and everything else figures out which network namespace you are talking about from the socket or network device.<br>

Network namespaces are sometimes useful for VPNs too. Instead of playing with 'split tunnelling' and having DNS tricks to look up certain domains on the VPN and others normally, you can put the VPN connection entirely into a namespace of its own. A trivial way of doing this (for which a vpnc-script already exists for use with vpnc and openconnect) is to make the namespace, put the vpn interface in it, run a new instance of sshd in that namespace and then connect to it with 'ssh -D 1080' to open a SOCKS proxy. Then you have full access to the VPN via SOCKS.<br>
<p>
W.r.t. user namespaces, it should be pointed out that uid 0 doesn't necessarily mean that you have "full root privileges". Those were separated out by capabilities long ago...<br>

I remember being very excited by the possibilities when reading about namespaces back in 2003 or so, but with the addition of per-container UIDs I can't help feel nothing but a case of extreme heebie-geebies about local security for the coming years.<br>
<p>
Considering it wasn't until relatively recently that kernel code would routinely directly compare the UID field to determine root privilege, and given that it's already quite difficult to maintain a mental model of how the UID/PID namespaces work, I suspect strong apprehension is a legitimate response toward any kernel config that has these features enabled at least for the immediate future.<br>

Internal to the kernel the mental model is quite simple, you use kuids and kgids.  The programming model is nice as simple as it has always been.<br>
<p>
Right on the edges of user space kuids and kgids are translated to/from uids and gids, and you must use the translation functions because they are type incompatible.<br>
<p>
As for the the kernel directly comparing the uid field to determine root privilege suid() and it's kin was replaced by capable calls internal to the kernel a decade or so ago.<br>
<p>
Like any thing new there are reasons to be cautious, but getting the data types wrong is not one of those reasons.  Similarly for system administrators there shouldn't really be any more challenge than using fake-root.<br>
<p>
But please if you aren't comfortable with user namespaces please disable them in your kernel builds that is what the config option is for.<br>

I'm bewildered by the mention in the article of user name spaces allowing one to have root privileges.  "Root privileges" is a way of saying, "all the capabilities" and has almost nothing to do with uids.  So how does this work?  Does the uid name space feature really allow a process to hold a capability whose power is somehow limited to a subset of the system?
<p>
Described like this, I can certainly see it taking a lot of work to convince people there's nothing to be afraid of in this feature.

These days there root doesn't have all capabilities because of, for example, se-linux.  We're sort of working to a goal where people can't load non-vendor modules or firmware without reconfiguring secure boot in the UEFI firmware.  So there are all kinds of things which root will be restricted from doing by default.<br>
<p>
One use of new namespace work would be to set up a chroot where people could install mysql and set up a webserver etc.  It's cheaper than using KVM for virtualization.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; So how does this work?  Does the uid name space feature really allow a process to hold a capability whose power is somehow limited to a subset of the system?</font><br>
<p>
Yes.  In the past, we simply had the 'capable()' call, which checked whether the current task had, say, CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  Now capabilities are targeted toward a particular user namespace, and the function to check for that ns_capable().  Importantly, any existing unconverted capable() call becomes a check targeted at the initial user namespace.  Therefore if we haven't specifically said "that capability is ok to be allowed in a non-init userns", then it won't be allowed.  Then, resources (say a network interface) belong to a namespace (a network ns, for the network interface), and each network namespace is owned by a user namespace, namely the userns from which the netns was created.  So we to check CAP_NET_ADMIN for an action on a nic, we can check for permission to the user namespace which owns the netns which owns the nic.<br>
<p>
(If you're asking more generally about the relation of root to capabilities, that has not changed - see the capabilities(7) man page, specifically searching for 'secbit'.)<br>

Hi Michael, thanks for the great writeup.  Wanted to point out one thing.  I'm sure this will be expanded upon in a later article, but<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; A process can see (e.g., view via /proc/PID and send signals with kill()) only processes contained in its own PID namespace and the namespaces nested below that PID namespace.</font><br>
<p>
That's true in the process' own (newly mounted) procfs.  But the contents of a procfs mount are determined by the superblock, which is determined by the pidns in which it was mounted.  The contents of a procfs mount are not determined by the pidns of the reader.<br>
<p>
Therefore, if I unshare a new pidns (and don't mount a new proc), I can look under the old /proc and see information on the tasks my the parent pidns.  Or for that matter mount -t proc proc /mnt, and see the old proc under /proc and new proc under /mnt.  (Note that one thing we don't (yet) have is an easy way to determine which tasks are the same.)<br>

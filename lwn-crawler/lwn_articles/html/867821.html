           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 2, 2021</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, 3,440 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the
mainline repository for the 5.15 development cycle.  A mere 3,440 patches
may seem like a slow start, but those patches are densely populated with
significant new features.  Read on for a look at what the first part of the
5.15 merge window has brought.
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The s390 architecture has gained support for the KFENCE and
     <strike>KASAN</strike> KCSAN
     development tools.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> It is now possible to place entire control groups into the
     <tt>SCHED_IDLE</tt> scheduling class â€” something that could only be
     done at the task level before.  The group as a whole will only
     run when there is nothing else for the CPU to do, but tasks within the
     group will still have their relative weights.
<li> After something like 17 years of development effort, the realtime
     preemption locking code has been merged.  This work <a
     href="/Articles/106010/">began in 2004</a> and has fundamentally
     changed many parts of the core kernel.  With this pull, the sleepable
     locks that make deterministic realtime response possible have finally
     joined all of that other work (though the kernel must be built with
     the <tt>REALTIME</tt> configuration option to use them).  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e5e726f7bb9f">This merge log</a>
     describes the major changes that this code brings.
<li> The io_uring subsystem now <a href="/Articles/863071/">supports</a>
     opening files directly into the fixed-file table without the use of a
     file descriptor.  This can yield some significant performance
     improvements for certain types of workloads; it also is a significant
     break from the Unix tradition of using file descriptors for open
     files. 
<li> Also new in io_uring is a new "BIO recycling" mechanism that cuts out
     some internal memory-management overhead; the result, it is claimed,
     is a 10% increase in the number of I/O operations per second that
     io_uring can sustain.
<li> Finally, io_uring has gained support for the <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mkdir.2.html"><tt>mkdirat()</tt></a>,
     <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/symlink.2.html"><tt>symlinkat()</tt></a>,
     and <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/link.2.html"><tt>linkat()</tt></a>
     system calls.
<li> BPF programs can now request and respond to timer events.  The timer
     API is severely undocumented; some terse information is available in
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b00628b1c7d5">this commit</a> and
     <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/68134668c17f">this one</a>,
     and there is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3540f7c6b96a">a
     test program</a> that contains an example.
<li> Core scheduler support for <a href="/Articles/838339/">scheduling
     on asymmetric systems</a> has been merged.  There is another piece to
     make use of this functionality on Arm processors that is presumably
     coming later in the merge window.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fanotify.7.html">fanotify
     API</a> has a new option, <tt>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</tt>, which causes a <a
     href="/Articles/794707/">pidfd</a> to be returned as part of the event
     metadata.  This (privileged) feature allows race-free identification
     of processes accessing monitored files.
<li> A <a href="/Articles/864363/">set of hole-punching fixes</a> should
     eliminate a class of subtle race conditions that could lead to file
     corruption.
<li> Support for mandatory file locking has been deprecated for years; it
     works poorly and is little used (if at all).  As of 5.15, support for
     mandatory locking has been removed altogether.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/641247/">LightNVM subsystem</a>, which provided
     direct access to solid-state storage without an emulation layer, has
     been removed.  According to <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9ea9b9c48387">the commit
     message</a>, LightNVM has been superseded by newer NVMe standards and
     is no longer needed.
<li> The kernel finally has an in-kernel server for the SMB filesystem
     protocol family.  According to <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e24c567b7ecf">the merge
     message</a>:
     <p>
     <blockquote class="bq">
     	ksmbd is a new kernel module which implements the server-side of
  	the SMB3 protocol. The target is to provide optimized performance,
  	GPLv2 SMB server, and better lease handling (distributed
  	caching). The bigger goal is to add new features more rapidly
  	(e.g. RDMA aka "smbdirect", and recent encryption and signing
  	improvements to the protocol) which are easier to develop on a
  	smaller, more tightly optimized kernel server than for example in
  	Samba.
	<p>
  	The Samba project is much broader in scope (tools, security
  	services, LDAP, Active Directory Domain Controller, and a cross
  	platform file server for a wider variety of purposes) but the user
  	space file server portion of Samba has proved hard to optimize for
  	some Linux workloads, including for smaller devices.
	<p>
  	This is not meant to replace Samba, but rather be an extension to
  	allow better optimizing for Linux, and will continue to integrate
  	well with Samba user space tools and libraries where
  	appropriate. Working with the Samba team we have already made sure
  	that the configuration files and xattrs are in a compatible format
  	between the kernel and user space server.
     </blockquote>
<li> The Btrfs filesystem has gained support for <a
     href="/Articles/790185/">fs-verity</a> file integrity assurance and <a
     href="/Articles/837566/">ID-mapped mounts</a>.
<li> The <tt>move_mount()</tt> system call (described in <a
     href="/Articles/759499/">this article</a>) has been extended to allow
     adding a mount to an existing sharing group.  This relatively obscure
     new feature evidently solves a lot of problems for the <a
     href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace</a>
     developers; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9ffb14ef61ba">this commit</a> for
     more information.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     Richtek RTQ6752 TFT LCD voltage regulators,
     Richtek RTQ2134 SubPMIC regulators,
     Rockchip serial flash controllers,
     Arm SMCCC random-number generators, and
     Aquacomputer D5 Next watercooling pumps.
<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     MediaTek Gigabit Ethernet PHYs,
     MHI WWAN MBIM interfaces, and
     LiteX Ethernet interfaces.
<li> <b>Power supply</b>:
     ChromeOS EC based peripheral chargers and
     Mediatek MT6360 chargers.
<li> <b>Virtual</b>:
     Virtio I2C adapters.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The networking subsystem now has support for per-VLAN multicast.  The
     truly determined can find some information about this feature in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/2c0804044781">this merge
     changelog</a>.
<li> The <a
     href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options-01.html">In-situ
     Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)</a>
     subsystem has gained support for the pre-allocated trace mechanism;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7c804e91df52">this merge
     commit</a> for some more information.
<li> The Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) is now supported;
     see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6a2d98b18900">this
     documentation commit</a> for details.
<li> Unix-domain sockets have gained support for out-of-band data.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> There is a new <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
     operation called <tt>PR_SPEC_L1D_FLUSH</tt>.  If a process turns this
     on, the kernel will flush the L1D (level-1 data) cache whenever
     that process is scheduled out of the CPU.  This should help to
     mitigate a number of potential speculative-execution vulnerabilities
     that can cause data to be leaked from the L1D cache â€” at a significant
     performance cost.  Note that this feature will <i>not</i> protect
     against a hostile process running on an SMT sibling processor; a
     feature like <a href="/Articles/861251/">core scheduling</a> must be
     used to protect against that case. The new <tt>prctl()</tt> can be
     disabled by the administrator; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b7fe54f6c2d4">this documentation
     patch</a> for details.
<li> The device mapper has gained support for remote attestation using the
     kernel's integrity measurement architecture.  See <a
     href="/Articles/868028/">Documentation/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-ima.rst</a>
     for details.


</ul>
<p>
The 5.15 merge window can be expected to stay open until September&nbsp;12,
assuming that the usual schedule holds.  LWN will be back with coverage of
the remainder of the merge window immediately after it closes; it seems
likely that there is quite a bit of work yet to be pulled for this
development cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

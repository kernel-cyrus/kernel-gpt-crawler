<p>
Making kernel interfaces that work for both 32- and 64-bit processors has
proved to be something of a challenge over the years.  One of the more
problematic areas has been passing arguments to <tt>ioctl()</tt> so that
the same code will work on both types of processor—in both big- and
little-endian varieties.  As a recent thread shows, not all of those
problems have 
been completely worked out over time. 


<p>
Aurelien Jarno <a href="/Articles/576273/">posted a question</a> to the
linux-fsdevel mailing list about <tt>FS_IOC_GETFLAGS</tt> and
<tt>FS_IOC_SETFLAGS</tt> (which query and set inode flags on files).
He noted that the definitions of those requests in
<tt>include/uapi/linux/fs.h</tt> 
listed the argument types as a pointer to <tt>long</tt>, except for the
32-bit compatibility versions, which specify an <tt>int&nbsp;*</tt>.  The
code in the
kernel filesystems expects and uses a 32-bit quantity, and
most—but
not all—user-space code passes a pointer to a 32-bit integer.  

<p>
Any
application that passed a pointer to a 64-bit integer would work, but only
on little-endian systems.
Since the kernel code treats the pointer as one to a 32-bit quantity,
it's a matter of which four bytes are accessed when the pointer is
dereferenced.  On big-endian processors, it is the most significant four
bytes, whereas little-endian systems reference the least significant
end. Since all of the flags live in the least significant four bytes, the 
big-endian systems effectively pass zero to <tt>FS_IOC_SETFLAGS</tt> or
retrieve a value with (undefined) high bits set with <tt>FS_IOC_GETFLAGS</tt>.

<p>
Darrick J. Wong <a
href="/Articles/576284/">pointed out</a> that the kernel FUSE driver uses
the types from that header, which also causes a
problem. The kernel driver expects to transfer a 64-bit
quantity, but most user-space programs only provide 32 bits.  He plans to
special case those <tt>ioctl()</tt> requests for FUSE.
</p>

<p>
The number of big-endian 64-bit systems (e.g. PowerPC, MIPS, and s390) is
dwarfed by the number of x86_64 little-endian processors.  That
means that few have seen the problem, but it also means that any fix needs to be
made carefully to avoid breaking millions of existing systems.
That is always an important—overriding—consideration for changes to the
kernel, of 
course, but Ted Ts'o <a href="/Articles/576377/">highlighted</a> that
concern when he explained a bit about how this had come about and why
changing to a <tt>long&nbsp;*</tt> everywhere would not work.  Because the
majority of user-space programs pass an <tt>int&nbsp;*</tt>, a change like
that  would
cause them to break on 64-bit systems regardless of the endian-ness. 
</p>

<p>
But, as Jarno <a href="/Articles/576378/">pointed out</a>, anyone trying to
do the right thing and look up the argument type in
<tt>&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</tt> will get it wrong.  "<q>The bare minimum would be to add a comment close to the
definition to explain to use an int and not a long.</q>"  It turns out
that there are four <tt>ioctl()</tt> requests (<tt>FS_IOC_GETVERSION</tt>
and <tt>FS_IOC_SETVERSION</tt> in addition to the get/set flags mentioned
above) that have the problematic definition.  Jarno <a
href="/Articles/576446/">posted a patch</a> to make that change by adding a
warning to <tt>include/uapi/linux/fs.h</tt> (which gets installed in
<tt>include/linux</tt>):
<div class="BigQuote">
<pre>
/*
 * WARNING: The next four following ioctls actually take an int argument
 * despite their definition. This is important to support 64-bit big-endian
 * machines.
 */
</pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>
One might think that just changing the type of the argument to 32 bits in
the header  
file would be a possibility, but that cannot be done either.  The mapping
of the request name to a number is done using a set of macros that use
<tt>sizeof()</tt> on the "<tt>type</tt>" argument.  For 64-bit systems that
is eight for a <tt>long</tt>, but 32-bit uses four.  Since the numbers
calculated for the requests
are now 
a fixed part of 
the Linux ABI, changing the type of the argument in that header would not
solve the problem.
</p>

<p>
Several suggested adding a new request type (<tt>FS_IOC_GETFLAGS_NEW</tt>
or <tt>FS_IOC_GETFLAGS_WIDE</tt> for example).  It would take a pointer to
a 64-bit integer on <i>all</i> architectures. That would have the
advantage of doubling the number of available flags, which may be getting
close to being consumed.  There are perhaps ten bits available today for
expansion, adding another 32 might cover any upcoming use cases, though
some are rather skeptical that 32 will be enough.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>FS_IOC_[GS]ETFLAGS</tt> requests were originally added for the ext*
filesystems, but have also been used by other filesystems over time.  In
addition, there are flags for other filesystems that are only available via
filesystem-specific <tt>ioctl()</tt> requests.  According to Dave Chinner, <a
href="/Articles/576460/">XFS already has roughly ten flags</a> available
using a 
different request (<tt>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR</tt>); other filesystems have
their own sets.  So, if a change is 
going to be made, Chinner said, why not create one that unifies all of the
disparate inode flag handling;
one that allows for more than
64 flags that might be completely exhausted soon.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o is <a href="/Articles/576461/">not convinced</a> that the additional
complexity is worth it.  But Chinner <a href="/Articles/576462/">sees</a>
XFS adding "<q>tens of new inode
flags</q>" over the coming years.  Other filesystems may well have
similar needs.  So a fixed-length bitmap may not be the best solution
long-term, but there was little agreement on which alternative should be
pursued. 
</p>

<p>
Chinner suggested some kind of attribute-based interface that is
open-ended so that it could be expanded to handle any inode flags for any
filesystems down the road.  He also mentioned the <a
href="/Articles/394298/"><tt>xstat()</tt> system call</a> as another possibility.
But, as  Andreas Dilger <a href="/Articles/576466/">pointed out</a>,
<tt>xstat()</tt> has been proposed many times, but has never made it into
the kernel.
</p>

<p>
So there are some possible solutions that "<q>solve the problem
once and for all</q>" (as Chinner put it), but it is not at all clear
that anyone is planning to push for one of them.  In the meantime, Jarno's
"fix" to the header file will at least help users pass the right argument
types.  The 
user-space applications that pass <tt>long</tt> pointers (bup and
libexplain were mentioned) will need to 
change, but that shouldn't be too onerous.  A more ambitious, global
solution may not be in the works anytime soon.

Much attention goes toward mainline kernel releases, but relatively few
users are actually running those kernels.  Instead, they run kernels
provided by their distributors, and those kernels, in turn, are based off
the stable kernel series.  The practice of releasing stable kernels has
been going for well over five years now, so perhaps it's time to look back
at how it has been going.
<p>
Back in March 2005, the community was discussing ways of getting important
fixes out to users of mainline releases.  There was talk of maintaining a
separate tree containing nothing but fixes; Linus, at the time, <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/283396">thought that any
such attempt was doomed to failure</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'll tell you what the problem is: I don't think you'll find
	anybody to do the parallel "only trivial patches" tree. They'll go
	crazy in a couple of weeks. Why? Because it's a _damn_ hard
	problem. Where do you draw the line? What's an acceptable patch?
	And if you get it wrong, people will complain _very_ loudly, since
	by now you've "promised" them a kernel that is better than the
	mainline. In other words: there's almost zero glory, there are no
	interesting problems, and there will absolutely be people who claim
	that you're a dick-head and worse, probably on a weekly basis.
</div>
<p>
With such strong words of encouragement, somebody clearly had to step up to
the job; that somebody turned out to be Greg Kroah-Hartman and Chris
Wright.  They released <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/126324/">2.6.11.1</a> on March&nbsp;4, 2005
with all of three fixes.  More than five years later, Greg (a.k.a. "<a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/402327/">Og</a>") is still at it 
(Chris has not been active with stable updates for a while).  During that
time, the stable release history has looked like this:

<p>
In the table above, the kernels appearing in <b>bold</b> are those which
are still receiving stable updates as of this writing (though 2.6.27 is
clearly reaching the end of the line).
<p>
A couple of conclusions immediately jump out of the table above.  The first
is that the number of fixes going into stable updates has clearly increased
over time.  From this one might conclude that our kernel releases have
steadily been getting buggier.  That is hard to measure, but one should
bear in mind that there is another important factor at work here: the
kernel developers are simply directing more fixes toward the stable tree.
Far more developers are looking at patches with stable updates in mind, and
suggestions that a patch should be sent in that direction are quite
common.  So far fewer patches fall through the cracks than they did in the
early days.
<p>
There is another factor at work here as well.  The initial definition of
what constituted an appropriate stable tree patch was severely restrictive;
if a bug did not cause a demonstrable oops or vulnerability, the fix was
not considered for the stable tree.  By the time we get to the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/402332/">2.6.35.4 update</a>, though, we see a wider
variety of "fixes," including Acer rv620 laptop support, typo fixes,
tracepoint improvements to make powertop work better, the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/401911/">optimistic spinning mutex
scalability work</a>, a new emu10k1 sound driver module parameter, and
oprofile support for a new Intel processor.  These enhancements are,
arguably, all things that stable kernel users would like to have.  But they
definitely go beyond the original charter for this tree.  
<p>
Your editor has
also, recently, seen an occasional complaint about regressions finding
their way into stable updates; given the volume of patches going into
stable updates now, a regression every now and then should not be
surprising.  Regressions in the stable tree are a worrisome prospect; one
can only hope that the problem does not get worse.
<p>
Another noteworthy fact is that the number of stable updates for most
kernels appears to be falling slowly; the five updates for the entire
2.6.34 update history is the lowest ever, matched only by the 2.6.13
series.  Even then, 2.6.34 got one more update than had been originally
planned as the result of a security issue.  It should seem obvious that
handling this kind of patch flow for as many as four kernels simultaneously
will be a lot of work; Greg, who has a few other things on his plate as
well, may be running a little short on time.
<p>

Who is actually contributing patches to stable kernels?  Your editor
decided to do a bit of git data mining.  Two kernels were chosen: 2.6.32,
which is being maintained for an extended period as the result of its use
in "enterprise" distributions, and 2.6.34, being the most recent kernel
which has seen its final stable update.  Here are the top contributors for
both:

Some names on this list will be familiar.  Linus never shows up on the list
of top mainline contributors anymore, but he does generate a fair number of
stable fixes.  Other names are seen less often in the kernel context:
Daniel Chen, for example, is an Ubuntu community contributor; his
contributions are mostly in the welcome area of making audio devices
actually work.  Some of the people are in the list above because they
introduced the bugs that their patches fix - appearing in that role is not
necessarily an honor.  But - admittedly without having done any sort of
rigorous study - your editor suspects that most of the people listed above
are fixing bugs introduced by others.  They are performing an important and
underappreciated service, turning mainline releases into kernels that the
rest of the world actually wants to run.

These numbers quite closely match those for mainline kernel contributions,
especially at the upper end.  Fixing bugs is said to be boring and
unglamorous work, but volunteers are still our leading source of fixes.  
<p>
We did without a stable tree for the first ten 2.6.x releases, though, at
this point, it's hard to imagine just how.  In an ideal world, a mainline
kernel release would not happen until there were no bugs left; the history
of (among others) the 2.3 and 2.5 kernel development cycles shows that this approach does
not work in the real world.  There comes a point where the community has to
create a stable release and go on to the next cycle; the stable tree allows
that fork to happen without ending the flow of fixes into the released
kernel.
<p>
The tables above suggest that the stable kernel process is working well,
with large numbers of fixes being directed into stable updates and with
participation from across the community.  There may come a point, though,
where that community needs to revisit the standards for patches going into
stable updates.  At some point, it may also become clear that the job of
maintaining these kernels is too big for one person to manage.  For now,
though, the stable tree is clearly doing what it is intended to do; Greg
deserves a lot of credit for making it work so well for so long.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Given the shear ubiquitous availability of .32 kernels (everything from Froyo Android devices to routers to enterprise os's), I will predict that that stable series will have a supported life far longer than the previous 2 extended support 2.6 kernels (.16 and .27). <br>

"volunteers are still our leading source of fixes"<br>
<p>
Though volunteers beat out any other single company source of fixes, if I'm interpreting the chart correctly for 2.6.32, (100% - 15.3%) = 84.7% are coming from companies.<br>
<p>
That said, I can imagine a good amount of the patches being submitted from company email addresses (which is what I assume the stats are generated off of) are done when the employee is "off the clock."<br>
<p>
So my question: do we (and how do we) actually know how much of the kernel development is really a volunteer effort?<br>
<p>
BTW, I've never seen anyone on this site call Greg a "dickhead" or anything close to it (I did a search to check, feel free to do your own).  Some people, myself included, disagree with how security is conveyed and sometimes handled, but it's a gross mischaracterization to equate that with childish ad-hominem attacks that were never uttered.<br>
<p>
I appreciate the effort Greg puts into the stable releases -- it's certainly a lot of work.  As for the major "enterprise" distributions that benefit from Greg's work, do we know what else they could be doing in addition to contributing fixes to lessen the burden?<br>

      Who is ever really off the clock in this field?
<p>
A patch posted from a company email address is assumed to be posted with that company's blessing.  Anybody who doesn't have that blessing is probably violating all kinds of rules.  In short: when somebody posts a patch, in the absence of information to the contrary, we attribute it to their employer.  The results are necessarily approximate, but I'm not sure how to do them better.

As a side note, I have seen some research on commit patterns across projects and it was really entertaining to see some projects following strict Mo-Fri 9-5 patterns while others (also including commercial developers) committed all over the place including weekends, nights etc.<br>

I would love to see that research across a wide range<br>

      I've been playing with the idea of producing similar stats for MySQL/MariaDB development, to benchmark it against Linux and other similar projects. This is an excellent idea to add to the analysis! Thanks.

Well, I tried to get the patch for deadlock issue our folks have nailed down and fixed (it was rather worked around upstream) along at least into 2.6.27.y since this summer, and so far rather failed to bring attention to the issue:<br>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15658">https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15658</a><br>

Tried to forward the message with brief explanation to LKML on Aug 28 but seems like it didn't pass through (at least not to lkml.org archive).<br>
<p>
I've re-read all of tux.org/lkml just in case, but still need advice on *how* volunteers should pass the fixes for such non-obvious issues?<br>
<p>
Thanks anyone who might find some time to aid with this one.<br>

      Is there some context in which Adrian should have been mentioned?  I didn't talk about 2.6.16, really...and he hasn't really been present in the kernel community for a while now.

this is where it gets interesting.<br>
<p>
it can be that someone just volunteers to maintain it after Greg finishes with it, it can be that one (or more in the case of ) major distros base their release kernel off of it, and as a result someone takes on the maintenance of the kernel after it would finish the normal process.<br>
<p>
about the only criteria is an elimination criteria. Namely that the kernel in question must not have a disastrous amount of regressions discovered in the normal -stable period.<br>

We discussed this at the LPC last year. If I remember correctly, Greg's answer was that:<br>
1. Distributions need to let him know which stable releases they want to keep going.<br>
2. They need to help in gathering updates, and potentially to take over maintenance.<br>

Your stats concerning the personal contribution to stable seem at first look pretty screwed:<br>
<p>
First of all it is not easy to find the one that forwarded a particular patch to stable.<br>
Secondly most in all times this random person gets gets showed into the Cc: of the stable patch and thus is not distinguisable from usual Cc's that happen to be listed there.<br>
<p>
A quick grep in the stable queue 2.6.32 releases showed 47 contributions of mine, but I'm 100% sure not to be the top contributor of it. But that forwarded patch number is certainly a lower bound.<br>
<p>
Please explain how you generated the stats concerning the most active contributor. Thanks.<br>

      I simply look at the author of each patch as is shown in the stable git repository.
<p>
A quick look through 2.6.32.y shows you CC'd on a number of patches, but you are not the author of them in stable or mainline.  Am I missing something?

I think maks (AKA maximilian attems, one of the Debian kernel maintainers) is suggesting that in addition to crediting the author of the patch, for stable patches it seems appropriate to note the person who dug up a patch from mainline that fixed a particular bug and passed it along to stable@ for inclusion in a stable kernel, even if they didn't *write* the mainline patch.  And I'd agree with that; while not the same metric as counting authors, it seems a useful metric for stable kernels.<br>
<p>
On that note, thanks to maks and the other Debian kernel maintainers for doing an awesome job. :)<br>

      I agree it would be nice to credit people who do that kind of work.  There is really no information trail at the moment which would make that possible, though.  Maybe we need a Spotted-by: tag to mark patches directed to stable by people other than their author?

Yes, that would be nice.<br>
<p>
Also, when there is no "spotted-by:" but there is a "cc: stable", it likely means that the patch author noticed it should go into stable.<br>
<p>
That said, I think "stable-proposal-by" would be a better tag.<br>

Hm, a simple "Signed-off-by:" should suffice. It's already standard practice for people who maintain their own tree and relay stuff upstream, and usually those trees are rebased often. So it might make sense to use that for singular cases as well (even if they're not merges).<br>
<p>
This...<br>
<p>
Signed-off-by: &lt;original author&gt;<br>
Signed-off-by: &lt;maintainer&gt;<br>
Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds<br>
<p>
Could turn into this...<br>
<p>
Signed-off-by: &lt;original author&gt;<br>
Signed-off-by: &lt;spotter&gt;<br>
Signed-off-by: Greg KH<br>
<p>
Possibly with some variation, such as whether or not you keep the maintainer in the Signed-off-by chain.<br>

<p>Yeah.  Here's a <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/205867">previous discussion</a>, where Linus says:

<blockquote>So when you save a patch from oblivion by passing it on to the right person, and get it submitted when it was originally dropped by some 
reason, you're actually doing a fundamentally important job. Maybe it's 
just one small piece of the puzzle, but hey, you'd only get one small line 
in the changeset, so the credit (or blame ;) really is appropriate.</blockquote>

Yes, thanks Maks!  I just loaded linux-image-2.6.35-1~experimental.2 on a Dell Latitude D430 sid and it fixed the suspend/resume problems.  (Q though: why does it depend on a linux-base that doesn't exist?)<br>

linux-base is used for the UUID transition. In Ubuntu it was the udev package that renamed the fstab and some bootloaders. afais linux-base is in experimental. When installing from exp one needs to tell apt to do so with ``-t'' switch aka:<br>
 apt-get install linux-image-2.6.35-trunk-amd64 -t experimental<br>
<p>
Hope that helps otherwise please ask on debian-kernel mailinglist.<br>

Ok thanks for the explanations.<br>
<p>
Got confused by the title of the table "Most active stable contributors" and thought it was about the ones that notify stable. Could then be renamed to "Most active stable authors".<br>
<p>
Indeed there is currently no possibility to easily see who forwarded the patches to gregkh.<br>

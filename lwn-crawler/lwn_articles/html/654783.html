           <p>This article was contributed by Joël Porquet</p>
           </div>
<p>Although a simple port may count as little as 4000 lines of code—exactly 3,775 for the mmu-less Hitachi 8/300 recently reintroduced in Linux
4.2-rc1—getting the Linux kernel running on a new processor architecture is a
difficult process. Worse still, there is not much documentation available
describing the porting process. The aim of this series of three articles is to
provide an overview of the procedure, or at least one possible procedure,
that can be followed when porting the Linux kernel to a new processor architecture.</p>

<p>After spending countless hours becoming almost fluent in many of the supported
architectures, I discovered that a well-defined skeleton shared by the majority
of ports exists. Such a skeleton can logically be split into two parts that
intersect a great deal. The first part is the boot code, meaning the architecture-specific code
that is executed from the moment the kernel takes over from the bootloader until
<code>init</code> is finally executed. The second part concerns the
architecture-specific code that is 
regularly executed once the booting phase has been completed and the kernel
is running normally.  This second part includes starting new threads, dealing with hardware
interrupts or software exceptions, copying data from/to user applications,
serving system calls, and so on.</p>

<h4>Is a new port necessary?</h4>

<p>As LWN <a href="/Articles/597351/">reported</a> about another porting
experience in an article 
published last year, there are three meanings to the word "porting".</p>

<div class="BigQuote">
It can be a port to a new board with an already-supported processor on it. Or
it can be a new processor from an existing, supported processor family. The
third alternative is to port to a completely new architecture.
</div>

<p>Sometimes, the answer to whether one should start a new port from scratch is
crystal clear—if the new processor comes with a new instruction set
architecture (ISA), that is usually a good
indicator. Sometimes it is less clear. In my case, it took me a couple weeks to figure
out this first question.</p>

<p>At the time, May 2013, I had just been hired by the French academic computer lab
<a href="http://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en">LIP6</a> to port the Linux kernel to <a href="https://www-soc.lip6.fr/trac/tsar">TSAR</a>, an academic processor
architecture that the system-on-chip research group was designing. TSAR is an
architecture that follows many of the current trends: lots of small,
single-issue, energy-efficient processor cores around a scalable
network-on-chip. It also adds some nice innovations: a full-hardware
cache-coherency protocol for both data/instruction caches and translation
lookaside buffers (TLBs) as well as
physically 
distributed but logically shared memory.</p>

<p>My dilemma was that the processor cores were compatible with the MIPS32 ISA,
which meant the port could fall into the second category: "new processor from an
existing processor family". But since TSAR had a virtual-memory model radically
different from those of any MIPS processors, I would have been forced to
drastically modify the entire MIPS branch in order to introduce this new
processor, sometimes having almost no choice but to surround entire files with
<code>#ifndef TSAR ... #endif</code>.</p>

<p>Quickly enough, it came down to the most logical—and interesting—conclusion:
<pre>
    mkdir linux/arch/tsar
</pre>

<h4>Get to know your hardware</h4>

<p><em>Really</em> knowing the underlying hardware is definitely the fundamental, and
perhaps most obvious, prerequisite to porting Linux to it.</p>

<p>The specifications of a processor are often—logically or physically—split
into a least two parts (as were, for example, the recently published
specifications for the new <a href="http://www.riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> processor). The first part usually
details the user-level ISA, which basically means
the list of user-level instructions that the processor is able to
understand—and execute. The second part describes the privileged architecture,
which includes the list of kernel-level-only instructions and the various system
registers that control the processor status.</p>

<p>This second part contains the majority—if not the entirety—of the
information that makes a port special and thus often prevents the developer from
opportunely reusing code from other architectures.</p>

<p>Among the important questions that should be answered by such specifications
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the virtual-memory model of the processor architecture, the format
of the page table, and the translation mechanism?</p>

<p>Many processor architectures (e.g. x86, ARM, or TSAR) define a flexible virtual-memory layout. Their virtual address space can theoretically be split any
way between the user and kernel spaces—although the default layout for
32-bit processors in Linux usually allocates the lower 3GiB to user space and
reserves the upper 1GiB for kernel space. In some other architectures, this
layout is strongly constrained by the hardware design. For instance, on MIPS32,
the virtual address space is statically split into two regions of the same
size: the lower 2GiB is dedicated to user space and the upper 2GiB to kernel
space; the latter even contains predefined windows into the physical
address space.</p>

<p>The format of the page table is intimately linked to the translation mechanism
used by the processor. In the case of a hardware-managed mechanism, when
the TLB—a hardware cache of limited size
containing recently used translations 
between virtual and physical addresses—does not contain the translation for
a given virtual address (referred to as <em>TLB miss</em>), a hardware state machine
will transparently fetch the proper translation from the page table structure
in memory and fill the TLB with it. This means that the format of the page
table must be fixed—and certainly defined by the processor's specifications.
In a software-based mechanism, a TLB miss exception is handled
by a piece of code, which theoretically leaves complete liberty as to how the
page table is organized—only the format of TLB entries is specified.</p></li>
<li><p>How to enable/disable the interrupts, switch from privileged mode to user mode
and vice-versa, get the cause of an exception, etc.?</p>

<p>Although all these operations generally only involve reading and/or modifying
certain bit fields in the set of available system registers, they are always
very particular to each architecture. It is for this reason that, most of the
time, they are actually performed by small chunks of dedicated assembly code.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the ABI?</p>

<p>Although one could think that the Application Binary Interface (ABI) is only
supposed to concern compilation tools, as it defines the way the stack is
formatted into stack-frames, the ways arguments and return values are given or
returned by functions, etc.; it is actually absolutely necessary to be
familiar with it when porting Linux. For example, as the recipient of system
calls (which are typically defined by the ABI), the kernel has to know where
to get the arguments and how to return a value; or on a context switch, the
kernel must know what to save and restore, as well as what constitutes the
context of a thread, and so on.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Get to know the kernel</h4>

<p>Learning a few kernel concepts, especially concerning the memory layout used by
Linux, will definitely help. I admit it took me a while to understand what
exactly was the distinction between <em>low memory</em> and <em>high memory</em>, and between
the <em>direct mapping</em> and <em>vmalloc</em> regions.</p>

<p>For a typical and simple port (to a 32-bit processor), in which the kernel
occupies the upper 1GiB of the virtual address space, it is usually fairly
straightforward. Within this 1GiB, Linux defines that the lower portion of it will be directly
mapped to the lower portion of the system memory (hence referred to as low
memory): meaning that if the kernel accesses the address <code>0xC0000000</code>, it will
be redirected to the physical address <code>0x00000000</code>.</p>

<p><p>In contrast, in systems with more physical memory than that which is mappable in
the direct mapping region, the upper portion of the system memory (referred to as high memory) is not normally accessible to the kernel. Other
mechanisms must be used, such as <code>kmap()</code> and <code>kmap_atomic()</code>, in order to gain
temporary access to these high-memory pages.</p>

<p>Above the direct mapping region is the vmalloc region that is controlled by
<code>vmalloc()</code>. This allocation mechanism provides the ability to allocate pages of
memory in a virtually contiguous way in spite of the fact that these pages may
not necessarily be physically contiguous. It is particularly useful for
allocating a large amount of memory pages in a virtually contiguous manner, as
otherwise it can be impossible to find the equivalent amount of contiguous free
physical pages.</p>

<p>Further reading about the memory management in Linux can be found in
<a href="/images/pdf/LDD3/ch15.pdf"><i>Linux Device Drivers</i> [PDF]</a>
and this <a href="/Articles/356378/">LWN article</a>.</p>


<h4>How to start?</h4>

<p>With your head full of the processor's specifications and kernel principles, it
is finally time to add some files to this newly created arch directory. But
wait ... where and how should we start?
As with any porting or even any code that must respect a certain API, the
procedure is a two-step process.</p>

<p>First, a minimal set of files that define a minimal set of symbols (functions,
variables, defines) is necessary for the kernel to even compile.  This set
of files and symbols can often be deduced from compilation 
failures: if compilation fails because of a missing file/symbol, it is a good
indicator that it should probably be implemented (or sometimes that some
configuration options should be modified).  In the case of porting Linux, this approach is particularly relevant when
implementing the numerous headers that define the API between the
architecture-specific code 
and the rest of the kernel.</p>

<p>After the kernel finally compiles and is able to be executed on the target
hardware, it is useful to know that the boot code is very sequential. That allows
many functions to stay empty at first and to only be implemented gradually until
the system finally becomes stable and reaches the <code>init</code>
process.  This approach is generally possible for almost all of the C functions executed
after the early assembly boot code. However it is advised to have the
<code>early_printk()</code> infrastructure up and working otherwise it can be difficult to
debug.</p>

<h4>Finally getting started: the minimal set of non-code files</h4>

<p>Porting the compilation tools to the new processor architecture is a
prerequisite to porting the Linux kernel, but here we'll assume it has already
been performed. All that is left to do in terms of compilation tools is to build
a cross-compiler. Since at this point it is likely that porting a standard C
library has not been completed (or even started), only a stage-1 cross-compiler
can be created.</p>

<p>Such a cross-compiler is only able to compile source code for bare metal
execution, which is a perfect fit for the kernel since it does not depend on any
external library. In contrast, a stage-2 cross-compiler has built-in support
for a standard C library.</p>

<p>The first step of porting Linux to a new processor is the creation of a new
directory inside <code>arch/</code>, which is located at the root of the kernel tree (e.g.
<code>linux/arch/tsar/</code> in my case). Inside this new directory, the layout is
quite standardized:</p>

<ul class="spacylist">
<li><code>configs/</code>: default configurations for supported systems (i.e.  <code>*_defconfig</code>
files)</li>
<li><code>include/asm/</code> for the headers dedicated to internal use only, i.e. Linux
source code</li>
<li><code>include/uapi/asm</code> for the headers that are meant to be exported to
user space (e.g. the libc)</li>
<li><code>kernel/</code>: general kernel management</li>
<li><code>lib/</code>: optimized utility routines (e.g. <code>memcpy()</code>, <code>memset()</code>, etc.)</li>
<li><code>mm/</code>: memory management</li>
</ul>

<p>The great thing is that once the new arch directory exists, Linux automatically
knows about it. It only complains about not finding a Makefile, not about this
new architecture:</p>

<pre><code>    ~/linux $ make ARCH=tsar
    Makefile: ~/linux/arch/tsar/Makefile: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>As shown in the following example, a minimal arch Makefile only has a few
variables to specify:</p>

<pre><code>    KBUILD_DEFCONFIG := tsar_defconfig

    KBUILD_CFLAGS += -pipe -D__linux__ -G 0 -msoft-float
    KBUILD_AFLAGS += $(KBUILD_CFLAGS)

    head-y := arch/tsar/kernel/head.o

    core-y += arch/tsar/kernel/
    core-y += arch/tsar/mm/

    LIBGCC := $(shell $(CC) $(KBUILD_CFLAGS) -print-libgcc-file-name)
    libs-y += $(LIBGCC)
    libs-y += arch/tsar/lib/

    drivers-y += arch/tsar/drivers/
</code></pre>

<ul class="spacylist">
<li><code>KBUILD_DEFCONFIG</code> must hold the name of a valid default configuration, which
is one of the <code>defconfig</code> files in the <code>configs</code> directory (e.g.
<code>configs/tsar_defconfig</code>).</li>
<li><code>KBUILD_CFLAGS</code> and <code>KBUILD_AFLAGS</code> define compilation flags, respectively for
the compiler and the assembler.</li>
<li><code>{head,core,libs,...}-y</code> list the objects (or subdirectory
containing the objects)
to be compiled in the kernel image (see
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt">Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt</a> for detailed information)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another file that has its place at the root of the arch directory is <code>Kconfig</code>.
This file mainly serves two purposes: it defines new arch-specific configuration
options that describe the features of the architecture, and it selects
arch-independent configuration options (i.e. options that are already defined
elsewhere in Linux source code) that apply to the architecture.</p>

<p>As this will be the main configuration file for the newly created arch, its
content also determines the layout of the menuconfig command (e.g. <code>make
ARCH=tsar menuconfig</code>). It is difficult to give a snippet of the file as it
depends very much on the targeted architecture, but looking at the same file for
other (simple) architectures should definitely help.</p>

<p>The <code>defconfig</code> file (e.g. <code>configs/tsar_defconfig</code>) is
necessary to complete the files related to the Linux kernel build system
(kbuild). Its role is to define the default configuration for the architecture,
which basically means specifying a set of configuration options that will be
used as a seed to generate a full configuration for the Linux kernel
compilation.  Once again, starting from defconfig files of other architectures
should help, but it is still advised to refine them, as they tend to activate
many more features than a minimalistic system would ever need—support for USB,
IOMMU, or even filesystems is, for example, too early at this stage of porting.</p>

<p>Finally the last "not really code but still really important" file to create is
a script (usually located at <code>kernel/vmlinux.lds.S</code>) that will instruct the
linker how to place the various sections of code and data in the final kernel image.
For example, it is usually necessary for the early assembly boot code to be set
at the very beginning of the binary, and it is this script that allows us do so.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>At this point, the build system is ready to be used: it is now possible to
generate an initial kernel configuration, customize it, and even start compiling
from it. However, the compilation stops very quickly since the port still
does not contain any code.</p>

<p>In the next article, we will dive into some code for the second portion of the
port: the headers, the early assembly boot code, and all the most important arch
functions that are executed until the first kernel thread is created.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
The final day of the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a> featured three separate sessions led by
Luis Chamberlain (he also led a <a href="/Articles/933437/">plenary</a> on
day two); the first of those was a filesystem session on the status of the
kthread-freezer-removal effort.  The kthread freezer is meant to help
filesystems freeze their state in order to
suspend or hibernate the system, but since at least&nbsp;2015, the <a
href="/Articles/662703/">freezer has been targeted for removal</a>.  Things
<a href="/Articles/705269/">did not change much</a> a year later, nor <a
href="/Articles/752588/">by 
LSFMM in&nbsp;2018</a> when Chamberlain had picked up Jiri Kosina's removal
effort; this year, Chamberlain was back to try to push things along.
</p>

<p>
It may come as a surprise to some that freezing filesystems in preparation
for suspending the system has been broken in Linux for years, he
began.  There is no unified mechanism to freeze filesystems and if there is
a lot of I/O going on, it can lead to a system hang when resuming, which is
not quite 
what users are looking for.
</p>

<p>
The problem comes about because the kthread-freezer API, which was added to
help stop in-flight I/O during suspend operations, has sloppy semantics and
is used somewhat haphazardly.  The control group (cgroup) freezer was
broken in the kernel the last time the kthread-freezer topic was discussed
at LSFMM, but he wondered if that was still the case.  It has been fixed,
Aleksa Sarai said, which required a new cgroup filesystem, another attendee
added.   There were also problems with the freezing process racing with
the automounter, Chamberlain said, but no one in the room seemed to know
about the status of that; "I guess we'll have to keep that in mind".
</p>

</a>

<p>
There are some ordering problems that will need to be resolved, which
eventually may require building a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the
filesystem 
superblocks so that freezing and thawing can be done in the right order.
He said that Al Viro has lamented the fact that he implemented the
<tt>LOOP_CHANGE_FD</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command so that Fedora live
installations could jump directly to the newly installed filesystem; that
breaks the expected ordering when iterating through superblocks, so
suspending those systems may be broken.  RAID can also introduce ordering
oddities. The assumption is that the ordering is consistent when iterating
forward and backward over the superblocks; it likely holds for most users
on laptops 
and mobile devices, who are the ones that predominantly do suspends in any
case. 
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain wondered if there was a need for a mechanism to notify user-space
applications that a suspend was coming in order to give them some time to
quiesce.  Ted Ts'o said that kind of notification exists in Windows, but
the applications need to be given some amount of time to actually quiesce;
if that 
process 
does not complete, the suspend needs to go on without them.  Implementing
the notification is not hard, "that's just plumbing" using D-Bus or
something similar.  
</p>

<p>
Handling network block devices is another problem area that was identified
eight years ago, Ts'o said; "everyone said 'yeah, that's hard' and they all
backed away slowly".  David Howells noted that FUSE filesystems add
complexity to the problem as well, since there are both kernel and
user-space pieces that have to be frozen.  Amir Goldstein pointed out that
the checkpoint/restore developers have already been dealing with these
kinds of 
complexities, which might serve as a model.
</p>

<p>
Lennart Poettering said that there is already a bunch of infrastructure in
systemd for doing the user-space notification.  If applications are
interested in getting the notification, they can get it from systemd, which
will give them a few seconds to react if needed.  He noted that the
suspend-then-hibernate sequence, which hibernates the system after a period
of time in suspend mode, currently wakes up all of user space for a brief
time before the hibernate, which is "just stupid".  So there is work
underway to leave all of user space frozen, using the cgroup freezer,
except for the small piece that 
oversees the switch to hibernating.  Jan Kara said that the kernel will
still have to unfreeze the filesystems so that the overseer process can
check the 
battery status and the like.
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain said that it sounded like the user-space side of the problem
was largely solved at this point.  He wanted to talk about what's next
after the kthread-freezer calls get removed from the filesystems.  That
removal is done using <a href="/Articles/315686/">Coccinelle semantic
patches</a>. His <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230508011717.4034511-1-mcgrof@kernel.org/">most
recent patch</a> is for the core of the automatic kernel freeze and resume
code that will replace the kthread freezer API; the previous <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230114003409.1168311-7-mcgrof@kernel.org/">RFC
patch set</a> from January has the removal for
more than a dozen filesystems using the Coccinelle rules.
</p>

<p>
He wondered if it makes sense to go ahead and remove the
use of the API in other parts of the kernel.  The API was added to allow
filesystems to stop I/O in flight, he said, so it is probably being used
incorrectly elsewhere.  Jeff Layton said that
the API is being used in NFS, and he is not convinced that is being done
correctly, so he would like help removing the kthread freezer from there.
Sarai said that cgroup v1 still uses the kthread freezer and he does not
know why it was not changed to match cgroup v2; there will need to be a
discussion about that before the API can be completely removed.  Howells
noted that all of the network filesystems will have some of the same
problems that Layton is concerned about.  Chamberlain wrapped things up by
saying that the removal can be done incrementally, working through
filesystems and subsystems one by one.

Note that the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frz4O5Dotvg">video</a> for this
session is mislabeled 
with the  name of the Chamberlain-led iomap-conversion-status session, which
took place right after.  As might be guessed, the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnHE6XYSsN8">video</a> for that
session is titled "Removal of kthread freezer next steps".<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

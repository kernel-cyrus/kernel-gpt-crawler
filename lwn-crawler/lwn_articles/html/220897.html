<h1>Kernel fibrillation</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted February 6, 2007 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/219954/">Last week's article on
fibrils</a> caught the discussion in a relatively early state.  That
discussion is <i>still</i> in an early state, but some interesting ground
has been covered.  Here, we'll catch up on a few themes from that
conversation.
<p>

Alan Cox has <a href="/Articles/220899/">requested that the "fibril" name
be dumped</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The constructs Zach is using appear to be identical to co-routines,
	and they've been called that in computer science literature for
	fifty years. They are one of the great and somehow forgotten ideas.
</div>
<p>
Alan also points out that a number of hazards lie between the current state
of the fibril patch and anything robust enough for the mainline kernel -
but everybody involved already knew that.  Linus <a
href="/Articles/220901/">acknowledges</a> the similarities with coroutines,
but also maintains that they are sufficiently different to merit their own
name.  A full coroutine implementation in the kernel, he says, would be
impractical.
<p>

Linus has also <a href="/Articles/220902/">responded</a> to Ingo Molnar's
criticisms of the fibril concept.  He maintains that the real benefits to
fibrils are (1)&nbsp;the elimination of the separate code paths currently
associated with asynchronous I/O, and (2)&nbsp;reductions in setup and
teardown costs.  The latter is significant, he says, because the bulk of
asynchronous operations can actually be satisfied from cache; being able to
run those operations without going through the full AIO setup would be a
big win.
<p>

Ingo has clarified his comments somewhat.  The stumbling point seems to be
the addition of a new scheduling concept which, he thinks, is not
necessary.  He has proposed alternatives which take the form of a pool of
kernel threads; rather than create a fibril, a blocking system call could
simply switch to another kernel thread which is there waiting for just that
occasion.  Ingo believes that kernel threads
perform well enough to handle this task, and they could be made lighter; in
addition, the use of kernel threads would allow asynchronous calls to
spread across a multi-CPU system.  Fibrils, instead, are currently limited to a
single processor.  Zach Brown, the creator of the fibril patchset, seems to
think that the idea is at least worth a try.  Linus, instead, has <a
href="/Articles/220908/">said</a> that any adaptation of kernel threads to
this task would end up looking a lot like fibrils anyway.  Rather than bear
the expense of keeping a (potentially large) pool of kernel threads around,
one might as well just create a truly lightweight object - a fibril.
<p>

Some discussion of the eventual user-space API has occurred.  Linus has <a
href="/Articles/220909/">suggested</a> that the asynchronous submission
call look something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    long async_submit(unsigned long flags, long *result_pointer,
                      long syscall_number, unsigned long *args);
</pre>
<p>
The role of the <tt>flags</tt> argument has not really been discussed; one
just assumes such an argument will be necessary, sooner or later.  The
<tt>result_pointer</tt> argument tells the kernel where to put the result
of the operation.  Interestingly, the result code would follow the
in-kernel conventions: zero for success or a negative error code for
failure.  While the operation is outstanding, the kernel would store a
positive "cookie" value which could be used by the application to wait for
(or cancel) the call.
<p>

The <tt>wait_for_async()</tt> system call remains for applications wanting
to get the completion status of their asynchronous operations.  There have
been a couple of requests, however, for a mechanism by which applications
could obtain completion status without having to go back into the kernel.
That inspired David Miller to <a href="/Articles/220912/">complain</a>
about a big part of the conversation which is <i>not</i> happening: the
integration with the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/213672/">kevent
patches</a>.  Much of the kevent work has been aimed at solving just this
problem, but Evgeniy Polyakov continues to have trouble getting people to
look at it.  To a great extent, <tt>wait_for_async()</tt> is another event
interface.  It seems unlikely that the kernel needs two of them.
<p>

What does all this work bode for the existing asynchronous I/O interface,
and, in particular, the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/216200/">buffered
filesystem AIO patches</a> which have not yet been merged?  Seeking to fend
off doubt about the future of that interface, Suparna Bhattacharya has <a
href="/Articles/220914/">argued that the buffered AIO patches should still
be merged</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Since this is going to be a new interface, not the existing linux
	AIO interface, I do not see any conflict between the two. Samba4
	already uses fsaio, and we now have the ability to do POSIX AIO
	over kernel AIO (which depends on fsaio). The more we delay real
	world usage the longer we take to learn about the application
	patterns that matter. And it is those patterns that are key.
</div>
<p>

Decision time will be soon, since the buffered AIO patches seem to be ready
for merging into 2.6.21.  Over the next couple of weeks, somebody will have
to decide whether to merge those patches - and maintain them indefinitely -
or hold off with the idea that fibrils will evolve into the preferred
solution.
<p>

Finally, Bert Hubert <a href="/Articles/220920/">noted</a> that DragonFly
BSD had an asynchronous system call interface - until last July, when the
developers pulled it out.  DragonFly had created two system calls -
<tt>sendsys2()</tt> and <tt>waitsys2()</tt> - which split up the tasks of
initiating a system call and waiting for its completion.  A <a
href="/Articles/220921/">followup</a> suggests that DragonFly BSD had taken
a different approach, requiring that every system call have asynchronous
support built into it.  In that sense, their asynchronous interface looked
like a more general version of Linux AIO.  
<p>

Pushing asynchronous support down into system calls, filesystems, and
device drivers brings a lot of complexity; the slow progress of Linux AIO
illustrates just how hard it can be.  One of the major advantages of the
fibril idea is that (with few exceptions) the system calls do not have to
be changed; they do not need to be aware of asynchronous operation at all.
The ability to pull asynchronous support into a relatively small chunk of
core kernel code may be the key idea that sells the entire fibril concept.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I find Evgeniy Polyakov's blog at <a href="http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/blog">http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/blog</a> a fascinating read even though I understand very little of it. It maybe that many other kernel hackers might not be reading it and understanding more about his point of view<br>

      Really sad that they all try to think up a new interface, while Kevent is being neglected all the time. Quite frustrating, especially for Evgeniy.<br>

<h1>Saying goodbye to set_fs()</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 24, 2020</br>
           </div>
The <tt>set_fs()</tt> function dates back to the earliest days of the Linux
kernel; it is a key part of the machinery that keeps user-space and
kernel-space memory separated from each other.  It is also easy to misuse
and has been the source of various security problems over the years; kernel
developers have long wanted to be rid of it.  They won't completely get their
wish in the 5.10 kernel but, as the result of work that has been quietly
progressing for several months, the end of <tt>set_fs()</tt> will be easily
visible at that point.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/722267/">This 2017 article</a> describes
<tt>set_fs()</tt> and its history in some detail.  The short version is
that <tt>set_fs()</tt> sets the location of the boundary between the
user-space portion of the address space and the kernel's part.  Any virtual
address that is below the boundary set by the last <tt>set_fs()</tt> call
on behalf of a given process is fair game for that process to access,
though the memory permissions stored in the page tables still apply.
Anything above that limit belongs to the kernel and is out of bounds.
<p>
Normally, that boundary should be firmly fixed in place.  When the need to
move it arises, the reason 
 is usually the same: some kernel subsystem needs to invoke a
function that is intended to access user-space data, but on a kernel-space
address.  Think, for example, of the simple task of reading the contents of
a file into a memory buffer; the <tt>read()</tt> system call will do that,
but it also performs all of the usual access checks, meaning that it will
refuse to read into a kernel-space buffer.  If a kernel subsystem must
perform such a read, it first calls <tt>set_fs()</tt> to disable those
checks; if all goes well, it remembers to restore the old boundary with
another <tt>set_fs()</tt> call when the work is done.
<p>
Naturally, history has proved that all does not always
go well.  It's thus not surprising that the development community has
wanted to rid itself of <tt>set_fs()</tt> for many years.  It's also
unsurprising that this hasn't happened, though.  The kernel project does
not lack for developers, but there is always a shortage of people who are
willing and able to do this sort of deep infrastructural work; it tends to
not feature highly in any company's marketing plan.  So the task of removing
<tt>set_fs()</tt> has languished for years.

<p>
Recently, though, Christoph Hellwig has stepped up to this task and the
kernel-wide cleaning-up that is required to get it done.
<p>
For example, one might be surprised to find <tt>set_fs()</tt> calls in the
core networking code, and even more surprised to learn that they were added
in 2019, during the 5.3 development cycle.  <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0d01da6afc54">The patch in question</a>
added the ability for BPF programs to invoke the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsockopt.2.html"><tt>setsockopt()</tt>
and <tt>getsockopt()</tt> system calls</a>.  Those calls are normally
invoked from user space, so they apply the usual access checks on any
parameters passed to them; calls originating from BPF programs, though,
will supply buffers in kernel space.  Putting in a call to
<tt>set_fs()</tt> in that case allowed those calls to work without further
modification.
<p>
Hellwig's plan for taking that <tt>set_fs()</tt> call back out involved the
creation of a new <tt>sockptr_t</tt> type that can hold an address
pointing into either kernel or user space:
<p>
<pre>
    typedef struct {
	union {
	    void	*kernel;
	    void __user	*user;
	};
	bool		is_kernel : 1;
    } sockptr_t;
</pre>
<p>
Code that initializes a <tt>sockptr_t</tt> variable must specify whether
the address is meant to refer to kernel or user space; a set of helper
functions can then be used to copy data to and from that address without
needing to worry further about where the destination buffer is — or to call
<tt>set_fs()</tt>.  As it turns out, <tt>setsockopt()</tt> and
<tt>getsockopt()</tt> offer a lot of different options, so <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200723060908.50081-1-hch@lst.de/">a long patch
series</a> was required to convert the relevant functions to
<tt>sockptr_t</tt> addresses.  At the end of the series, the
<tt>set_fs()</tt> calls were removed.  This series entered the mainline
during the 5.9 merge window.
<p>

Something that was <i>not</i> merged was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200624162901.1814136-1-hch@lst.de/">an earlier
version of this idea</a>, which was meant to be used throughout the kernel.
Hellwig proposed the creation of a "universal pointer" type (<tt>uptr</tt>)
that functioned like <tt>sockptr_t</tt>; it was accompanied by a pair of
new <tt>file_operations</tt> methods that would work with those pointers.
Then, any kernel subsystem that might need to perform I/O on both
kernel-space and user-space pointers could be converted to use these new
methods rather than calling <tt>set_fs()</tt>.

<p>
Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wit9enePELG=-HnLsr0nY5bucFNjqAqWoFTuYDGR1P4KA@mail.gmail.com/">vetoed
that idea</a>; he objected to the addition of the new type and
<tt>file_operations</tt> methods, which he saw as temporary and unnecessary workarounds for
the real problem.  If somebody was going to bother to
convert ordinary <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> calls to the new
<tt>read_uptr()</tt> and <tt>write_uptr()</tt>, he asked, why wouldn't they
just convert to the existing <tt>read_iter()</tt> and <tt>write_iter()</tt>
methods instead?  Those methods already handle the different address spaces
just fine (through yet another union in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.10/source/include/linux/uio.h#L30"><tt>struct
iov_iter</tt></a> that tracks which type of address is in use); indeed,
much of the work to remove <tt>set_fs()</tt> calls in various parts of the
kernel has involved switching to <tt>iov_iter</tt>.  So the <tt>uptr</tt>
type fell by the wayside, but the <tt>sockptr_t</tt> was able to overcome
Torvalds's opposition and was merged.

<p>
Then, there is the <tt>set_fs()</tt> call that isn't actually there.  In
current kernels, the boundary between kernel and user space is established
fairly late in the boot process (but before the <tt>init</tt> process is
started).  Before that happens, kernel functions that operate on user-space
pointers will happily use kernel-space pointers instead; parts of the
initialization code (dealing with the initial ramdisk, for example) depend
on this behavior.  Eliminating that implicit <tt>set_fs()</tt> call
required <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200728163416.556521-1-hch@lst.de/">another patch
series</a> creating a set of special helpers that is discarded once the
bootstrap process is complete.  This series, too, was merged for the 5.9
release. 

<p>
The final step, for the x86 and PowerPC architectures at least, is <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200903142242.925828-1-hch@lst.de/">this patch
series</a> removing <tt>set_fs()</tt> entirely.  Getting there requires
tidying up a number of loose ends.  It adds <tt>iov_iter</tt> support to
the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem, for example.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200903142242.925828-6-hch@lst.de/">This patch</a>
converts <tt>kernel_read()</tt> and <tt>kernel_write()</tt> (yet another
way to perform I/O on kernel-space buffers) to <tt>iov_iter</tt>, removing
the <tt>set_fs()</tt> calls previously used there.  The <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html"><tt>splice()</tt></a>
implementation is changed in a way that might break existing users: it
simply no longer works if the data source is a device that does not support the
<tt>splice_read()</tt> method.  Hellwig said that the affected users all
appear to have  working fallbacks in place, but that specific devices can
gain <tt>splice_read()</tt> methods if the need turns out to exist.
<p>
After a few more patches to remove the last uses of <tt>set_fs()</tt> from
the x86 and PowerPC architectures, support for <tt>set_fs()</tt> itself is
disabled and the task is complete.  These patches are currently in
linux-next, and thus should be merged for the 5.10 release.  Hellwig has
also posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200907055825.1917151-1-hch@lst.de/">a patch set
for RISC-V</a>, and Arnd Bergman has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200918124624.1469673-1-arnd@arndb.de/">a patch set
for Arm</a>, but those have not yet been applied.  Hellwig intends to
work through the remaining architectures, removing <tt>set_fs()</tt> from
each.
<p>
The patches described above are only a small portion of the effort that has
gone into making it possible to finally get rid of <tt>set_fs()</tt>.
The end result of all this work is the near elimination of a kernel
interface that has been deemed dangerous for almost as long as it has
existed — and it has been around for a long time.  It is an example of a
form of kernel development
that tends not to create headlines, but which quietly keeps
the kernel maintainable in the long term.  Tasks like this often suffer from a
lack of attention, but they do tend to get done in the long run, which is a
good thing; even after nearly 30 years, there is a lot of cleaning up still
to be done in the kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve written any kernel code, but I remember reading in the kernel coding style document (or some other list of &quot;dos and don&#x27;ts&quot;) that one shouldn&#x27;t use typedefs for structs. The reasoning being, if something is a struct, that fact should be clearly visible to all users instead of being hidden behind an opaque typedef, to avoid being bitten by e.g. a function parameter taking more than one register, the access not being atomic, and similar gotchas.<br>
<p>
So why use one for this new type? Has the general consensus changed, or is there an advantage in this specific situation? Is the idea that is_kernel will always be known at compile time and the compiler will optimize it away, leaving just the pointer? Or am I missing something?<br>

I guess in this case they want most code to treat it as an opaque type and not to mess with the internal struct fields.<br>
<p>
from the docs:<br>
<p>
Lots of people think that typedefs ``help readability``. Not so. They are<br>
useful only for:<br>
<p>
 (a) totally opaque objects (where the typedef is actively used to **hide**<br>
     what the object is).<br>
<p>
     Example: ``pte_t`` etc. opaque objects that you can only access using<br>

This one did create headlines, in the Register. Shame the article was terrible. If you believe El Reg&#x27;s article, set_fs is a &quot;defunct addressing artifact&quot; that has &quot;been made redundant by chipmakers&quot;, because apparently the author didn&#x27;t realise that this article isn&#x27;t talking about removing the %fs register, that set_fs is used on non-x86-compatible platforms, that it hasn&#x27;t used %fs even on x86 for absolutely ages, and that the %fs register is in the userspace ABI and is not going away. Apparently set_fs removal it also has to do with 286s, which is a neat trick given that Linux never ran on 286s and 286s don&#x27;t even have %fs and %gs registers.<br>

It&#x27;s fun to follow other trade press now and then: it reminds me of how privileged we are to have something of the sheer quality of LWN.<br>

Richard Guy Briggs works on the kernel's <a
href="https://github.com/linux-audit">audit subsystem</a> for Red Hat and
has run 
into some problems with the interaction between the audit daemon
(<tt>auditd</tt>) and namespaces.  He gave a report on those difficulties to
the <a 
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-security-summit">Linux
Security Summit</a> in Toronto.  In the talk, he also looked at
containers and what they might mean in the context of audit.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Audit was started in 2004, around the same time that the kernel started
using Git.  It is a "syslog on steroids", he said. Syslog is used a lot for
debugging, but audit is meant as a secure audit trail to log kernel and other
events in a 
way that could be used in court.  There are configurable filters in the
kernel for what events should be logged and it has the <tt>auditd</tt>
user-space daemon that 
can log 
to disk or the network.
</p>

<p>
Audit only reports on behavior; it does not actively interfere with what
is going on in the system.  There is one exception, though:  audit can
panic the system if it cannot log its data.
</p>

<p>
Briggs then went through a bit of an introduction to <a
href="/Articles/531114/">namespaces</a> in Linux, noting that
they are a kernel-enforced user-space view of the resource being
namespaced.  There are seven different namespaces in Linux; three are
hierarchical in nature (PID, user, and control groups), which means their
permissions and configuration are inherited from the parent namespace,
while the other four are made up of peer namespaces (mount, UTS, IPC, and
net). 
</p>

<p>
He is not sure that anyone actually uses IPC namespaces, he said, but the net
namespace is one of the easier ones to understand.  Network devices can be
assigned to a net namespace from the initial net namespace, so each
namespace can have its own firewall rules, routing, and so on.  If two
namespaces need to talk, a virtual ethernet pair can be set up between them.
</p>

<p>
The user namespace has been "the most contentious one so far", as there are
a number of "security traps" in allowing unprivileged users to be root
within the namespace.  Many distributions don't enable the feature by
default at this point.  The <a href="/Articles/621006/">control groups
(cgroups)  namespace</a>, which is 
the most recent 
namespace 
(added in 4.6), is meant to hide system-resource limits so that processes
only see 
what resources have been allocated to their cgroup.
</p>

<p>
Namespaces are one component of the concept of containers, but there really is
no hard definition of containers, Briggs said.  In fact, there are almost
as many definitions as there are users of containers.  There is some
general agreement that containers use a combination of namespaces, cgroups,
and seccomp to partition some portion of the system into its own world.
</p>

<p>
But the kernel has no concept of a container at all.  Managing containers
is left up to a user-space container-orchestration system of some kind.
From an audit 
perspective, though, there is interest in having some knowledge of
containers in the kernel.  That might be through some form of "container
ID" or simply by collecting up the namespace IDs that correspond to the
container. 
</p>

<h4>Problems</h4>

<p>
With that introductory material out of the way, he turned to the problems,
which boil down to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(franchise)">Highlander</a>
quote: "There can be only one."  The "one" in this case is <tt>auditd</tt>,
which 
runs in the initial namespace but must be reachable
from the other namespaces.  For the mount, UTS, and IPC namespaces, there
have been no problems, but others do have a variety of issues.
</p>

<p>
For example, the net namespace partitions netlink sockets (which processes
use to talk to the audit subsystem) so that only processes in the initial
network namespace can send their audit messages.  That broke various
container implementations because things like pluggable authentication
modules (PAM) would try to write an audit message and get an unexpected
error return.  Instead of the <tt>ECONNREFUSED</tt> error that it expected
when <tt>auditd</tt> cannot be reached, PAM-using programs
(e.g. the login process) would get <tt>EPERM</tt> and fail such that users
could not log in.  The short-term
solution for that was to simply "lie" in non-initial namespaces and return
the expected error message so that user-space programs do not break.
</p>

<p>
For PID namespaces, the problem cropped up with <a
href="https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html">vsftpd</a> authentication
that wanted to write a log message to <tt>auditd</tt>.  Until 3.15, that
could only be done from the initial PID namespace, where processes could
see the PID of 
<tt>auditd</tt>.  Some distributions put vsftpd in its own PID namespace,
however, which meant that vsftpd could not talk to auditd.  By adding the
<tt>CAP_AUDIT_WRITE</tt> capability to the program and adding some code in
3.15, though, that could be 
worked around. 
</p>

<p>
PID namespaces also present another problem for audit: the PIDs that get
reported are not the "real" PIDs in the system.  Processes within a PID
namespace get their own PID range that is separate from the PIDs
in the parent namespace (which might be the initial namespace where the
real system PIDs are used). So audit needed to do a translation of the PID
reported 
from non-initial PID namespaces.  Someday, when <tt>CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL</tt>
is allowed in PID namespaces (so that processes with that capability can
configure the audit filters), there will need to be more cleanup done on
the PID handling in the kernel, he said.
</p>

<p>
Allowing multiple <tt>auditd</tt> processes in the system would be
reasonable if they are tied to user namespaces.  There was an idea "thrown
around" about creating a new audit namespace, but it became clear that yet
another namespace was not a particularly popular idea. Having one
<tt>auditd</tt> per user namespace still requires some process having
<tt>CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL</tt> within the namespace.  He wondered if the
process creating the user namespace also needed that capability.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, the configuration of audit running in the initial namespace
cannot be changed from inside user namespaces even with the capability.  In
particular, only the initial namespace audit can panic the system; instead
of that, the audit in a user namespace might instead kill off the user
namespace and all its children if it cannot log (thus wants to panic).  So
each user namespace will 
get its own set of audit rules (a "rulespace") and its own event queue.
Originally it was thought that the event queue might be shared by all of the
<tt>auditd</tt> processes, but a single one that overflowed the queue would
affect the rest of the system, which is unacceptable, Briggs said.
</p>

<p>
There is interest in being able to track containers by some kind of ID.
There was a proposal in 2013 to use the <tt>/proc</tt> inode number that
uniquely identifies each namespace in the audit log messages.  He felt that
was harder to use, so he prototyped a simple incrementing serial number for
each namespace.  The checkpoint/restore in user space (CRIU) developers
were not happy with that, since those numbers would not easily translate
during a migration.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, Briggs reworked the inode-number-based scheme to work with the
namespace filesystem (nsfs).  Each event then has a set of namespace IDs
along with a device ID for the nsfs.  That allows container orchestration
systems to track the information, even across migrations, which allows them
to aggregate logs from multiple hosts.
</p>

<p>
An alternative would be to add a "container ID" that would be set by the
orchestration system and tracked in the task structure.  The container ID
would be inherited by children and audit events would contain the ID.
There is precedent for this kind of ID, he said; session IDs are not something
the kernel itself knows anything about, but it helps user space manage
those values.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, he said that namespace support for audit is largely working
at this point, though changes for net and PID namespaces will be needed
down the road.  There is work to be done to allow multiple <tt>auditd</tt>
processes anchored to the user namespace, as well.  As far as IDs go, there
is a decision to be made between the list of namespace IDs versus a single
kernel-managed container ID.  He favors the former, even though dealing
with eight separate numbers is harder to use.  Either solution will require
higher-level tools to map, track, and aggregate information about the
containers across multiple hosts.

<p>
Adding a "container ID" would also help to enable container-aware tracing support. <br>
<p>
We are working on filtering container specific events when perf tool is executed inside a container [1]. One of the challenges is that the kernel has no concept of a container. This makes it difficult to identify whether an event was triggered inside a container or not. We have attempted two solutions for this. The first solution adds a new perf namespace [1] and the second uses the existing cgroup namespace as the container identifier in the kernel [2]. However, we think setting the "container ID" by the orchestration system is a clean solution.<br>
<p>
+1 for the above suggestion of adding a "container ID". <br>

A quick-and-dirty trick would be to use the existing session ID as the container ID. That is, the container orchestration engine (Docker daemon, runC, rkt) uses setsid to become a new session leader. The session/container ID will then be inherited by all processes spawned inside the container. I think this will not bend the session concept too much: we will just add a new use for the session ID (container session) to the existing terminal and daemon session ID usages. Session IDs are already recorded in the audit log entries. <br>
<p>
Any process can easily become a new session leader, but these events should be being logged. Thus one analysing the audit log might need to backtrace a session ID's ancestry to link it to its respective container, if that is the case. Another solution would be to restrict setsid inside containers (using seccomp, for instance) so the ID would remain constant for all processes inside the same container.<br>

Hi Aravinda, Can you elaborate more on this? I am trying to separate audit/event logs of each docker container. But I do not see separate session ID for each separate container event logs. All logs have same session ID. <br>

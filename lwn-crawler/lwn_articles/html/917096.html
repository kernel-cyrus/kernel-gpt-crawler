           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 6, 2022</br>
           </div>
The kernel's page cache holds pages from files in RAM, allowing those
pages to be accessed without expensive trips to persistent storage.
Applications are normally entirely unaware of the page cache's operation;
it speeds things up and that is all that matters.  Some applications,
though, can benefit from knowledge about how much of a given file is
present in the page cache at any given time; the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221205175140.1543229-1-nphamcs@gmail.com/">proposed
<tt>cachestat()</tt> system call</a> from Nhat Pham is the latest in a long
series of attempts to make that information available.
<p>
In truth, even current kernels make it possible to learn which pages of a
file are present in the page cache.  The application just needs to map the
file into its address space with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>,
after which a call to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mincore.2.html"><tt>mincore()</tt></a>
will return a vector showing which pages in that file are resident.  This
is an expensive solution, though; it requires setting up a (possibly
unneeded otherwise) mapping and returns information that, for many
applications, has a higher resolution than is necessary.
<p>
The proposed <tt>cachestat()</tt> system call is rather simpler:
<p>
<pre>
    struct cachestat {
        __u64 nr_cache;
        __u64 nr_dirty;
        __u64 nr_writeback;
        __u64 nr_evicted;
        __u64 nr_recently_evicted;
    };

    int cachestat(unsigned int fd, off_t offset, size_t len, size_t cstat_size, 
		  struct cachestat *cstat);
</pre>
<p>

This call will check the pages of the file indicated by <tt>fd</tt>,
starting at the given <tt>offset</tt> and going for <tt>len</tt> bytes, and
count the number of pages that are in various states of residency.  The
<tt>offset</tt> must be page-aligned; <tt>len</tt> will be rounded up to a
multiple of the page size if needed.  The
counts will then be returned in the structure pointed to by <tt>cstat</tt>.
In that structure, <tt>nr_cache</tt> is the number of pages in the given
range that are present in the page cache, <tt>nr_dirty</tt> is the number
of those pages that are dirty (have been modified and not yet written back
to persistent storage), and <tt>nr_writeback</tt> is the number of pages
currently being written back.
<p>
The <tt>nr_evicted</tt> field provides the
count of how many pages were once resident in the cache but have since been
forced out, and <tt>nr_recently_evicted</tt> is the number of those that have been
forced out in the recent past.  In this case, the "recent past" is defined
by the number of pages that have been evicted since the page in question
was forced out; if that number is smaller than the process's working-set
size, the eviction is deemed to be recent.  These counts are obtained by
looking at the shadow page-table information that was <a
href="/Articles/495543/">added to the kernel</a> about ten years ago.
<p>
The size of the <tt>cachestat</tt> structure must be provided to
<tt>cachestat()</tt> as <tt>cstat_size</tt>.  This interface allows new
fields to be added to that structure in the future; if <tt>cstat_size</tt> is
smaller than the size as known within the kernel, data will only be
provided up to the provided size, preserving compatibility.  (If, instead,
<tt>cstat_size</tt> is larger than what the kernel expects, the call will
fail with an <tt>EINVAL</tt> error).
<p>
By not requiring the mapping and unmapping of the file(s) to be queried,
<tt>cachestat()</tt> avoids most of the overhead created by the
<tt>mincore()</tt> method.  The fact that this call returns simple counts
rather than detailed, by-page information is also helpful in the end; it
seems that applications wanting this kind of information are interested in
the number of cache-resident pages, but they don't really care about
<i>which</i> pages are resident.  So there is no point in returning the
more detailed data.
<p>
One open question that is not well answered in this patch set, though, is:
what kinds of applications will benefit from this information?  When LWN <a
href="/Articles/371538/">covered a similar effort</a> in 2010 (the system
call was called <tt>fincore()</tt> then), the use case involved
applications that call <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/posix_fadvise.2.html"><tt>posix_fadvise()</tt></a>
to bring data into the page 
cache prior to accessing it.  These applications (SQLite is evidently one
of them) know what their data-access patterns will be, but they have less
information about how much of their data will fit into the page cache at
any given time.  By calling <tt>cachestat()</tt>, such an application can
learn whether the pages it is prefetching into the cache are still there by
the time it gets around to using them.  If those pages are being evicted,
the prefetching is overloading the page cache and causing more work
overall; in such situations, the application can back off and get better
performance.
<p>
So <tt>cachestat()</tt> appears to be useful, but whether there is room in
the kernel for this new system call remains to be seen.  Attempts to add
this functionality have faltered for over a decade, perhaps due to the
highly specialized nature of the use case.  But, just maybe, the new interface
and renewed push for inclusion will get it over the bar this time.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It would be really great if there was a way to list system's page-cache contents: like which inodes are there and which of their offset ranges are covered.<br>
<p>
Same goes for files currently being read or written from a block device and their offsets - blktrace only shows raw block device operations, AFAIK there's no way to see which files they pertain to.<br>
<p>
This would really help debugging or fine tuning the page cache replacement algorithm.<br>

      That tracepoints' output look sensible, thanks.<br>
<br>
I've also looked at related tracepoints and <code>writeback:writeback_single_inode</code> and <code>writeback:writeback_written</code> seem to be the most useful ones for tracing inode writeback.<br>
<br>
Although an ability to list page-cache contents would still be useful for debugging cases which occur only infrequently, where it is not practical to have tracing enabled 24/7.

Some information is available, but the tooling for it is quite janky. The kernel's tools/vm/page-types can show the set pages that exist for a file, the pages for a process, etc. I don't think it can show the set of files that are cached though.<br>

This needs a minor tweak to handle large folios correctly -- ask each page that you retrieve how large it is instead of assuming it's PAGE_SIZE<br>

Ah, thanks. I seem to remember that at one point, we would put the head page of a huge page in i_pages multiple times, one for each PAGE_SIZE unit that it covered. Is that not the case anymore?<br>

We've had three representations of THPs in the page cache. Before I got to it, each page in a THP was inserted into the tree. I first changed that to inserting the head page N times. For a while now, we've used the sibling feature of the radix tree / XArray to insert the head page just once.<br>
<p>
There's two reasons for the latest change; the first is that it handles tags/marks correctly; if you mark any index as dirty, it marks the entire range as dirty. That's important for range writeback (which wasn't needed for shmem but is for XFS!). The second reason is that it saves memory once you have a page of order 6 or higher; a THP of order 9 saves 8 radix tree nodes, each of which occupies a seventh of a 4kB page, so about 4682 bytes.<br>

      That's an impressive script made on demand, thanks!<br>
<br>
I think it would be great if it was included as an example in the <code>contrib</code> directory of your <code>drgn</code> repo for posterity as it will get quickly lost buried deeply in comments here.<br>
<br>
There's even a related <code>fs_inodes.py</code> script already there.

I always wondered, how do you handle situations where you for example want to<br>
replace 1 int with 4 chars or something like that? The size stays the same (on<br>
some platforms). How do you handle that? Add some padding or something to make<br>
sure the size is different? Or is it that you basically never remove fields and<br>
just mark them unused/reserved, so the structure is always just growing?<br>

I think that's the sane thing, only adding to the structure and keeping older fields at some dummy default value.<br>
<p>
If you think about mismatch between kernel and userlevel, with potentially ancient userlevel tools inside containers or whatever, you don't want to confuse them by changing representation of fields.<br>

<p>The 13th <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kvm-forum-2019/">KVM
Forum</a> virtualization conference took place in Lyon, France in October
2019. One might think that development may have finished on the Kernel
Virtual Machine (KVM) module that was merged in Linux 2.6.20 in 2007, but
this year's conference underscored the amount of work still being done,
particularly on side-channel attack mitigation, I/O device assignment with
VFIO and mdev, footprint reduction with micro virtual machines (VMs), and
with the ability to 
run VMs nested within VMs. Many talks also involved the virtual machine
monitor (VMM) user-space programs that use the KVM kernel module—of which
<a href="https://qemu.org/">QEMU</a> is the most widely used.</p>

<h4>Side-channel attacks and memory isolation/encryption</h4>

<p>Side-channel attacks leak sensitive information by attackers using
mechanisms other than the 
intended input and output methods. They have become more problematic,
recently, by being coupled  with speculative
execution.  The KVM project is looking at ways to mitigate these attacks.</p>

<p>Dario Faggioli presented "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmwB/core-scheduling-for-virtualization-where-are-we-if-we-want-it-dario-faggioli-suse">Core-Scheduling
for Virtualization: Where are We?</a>" for a scheduler-centric way of
mitigating side-channel attacks.</p>

<a href="/Articles/805113/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/kvmf-group-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
alt="[Group photo]" title="Group photo" width=300 height=200>
</a>

<p>With simultaneous multi-threading ("hyperthreading" or SMT), cores are
shared by threads; 
some of the CPU resources are shared and the threads share cache (even L1),
which boosts performance with SMT-aware scheduling. Core scheduling tags
tasks that can be scheduled together on a core. The scheduler will only
place tasks with the same tag onto a core at any given time.
Tasks in different security domains can be given different tag values to
ensure they do not share the same core, thus thwarting some side-channel attacks.
Core scheduling also helps
achieve fairness of accounting in cloud environments where a busy thread
may consume more CPU resources than a less busy thread sharing the same
core.</p>

<p>
Core scheduling can also be used to align guest virtual CPUs (vCPUs)
with the host 
SMT topology so that intelligent scheduling decisions are
made. Furthermore, <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/l1tf.html">L1
Terminal Fault</a> (L1TF) and <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html">Microarchitectural 
Data Sampling (MDS)</a> are the two prominent side-channel attacks that
core scheduling addresses.</p>

<p>The goal of core scheduling as a side-channel-attack mitigation is to
achieve higher performance than by disabling SMT altogether.
Hyper-V and Xen
already support core scheduling. Patches for Linux are not yet upstream and a
set of benchmark results shows that performance still varies wildly between
workloads. More work is needed to handle pathological cases where workloads
run much slower with core scheduling.</p>

<p>
 L1TF is a hardware vulnerability that allows
unprivileged speculative access to data which is available in the level-1
data (L1D) cache when the page-table entry (PTE) for a virtual address has the
"present" bit cleared or other reserved bits set. If an instruction accesses
a virtual address mapped by a non-present PTE, a page fault is raised only
when the faulting instruction retires. Until then, the speculative value
from the L1D cache is computed. This can result in unauthorized
access through the faulting instruction and can leak a secret key from
another guest or from the host system.</p>

<p>This problem can be mitigated by flushing the L1D cache on entry to the
VM and by using 
a shadow memory-management unit (MMU). Flushing the L1D cache is not
sufficient to mitigate L1TF 
attacks when hyperthreading is enabled because the L1D cache is shared between
hyperthreads on same core. Guest vCPUs can leak L1D cache
data populated
either by sibling hyperthreads running vCPUs of another VM or by sibling
hyperthreads running vCPU threads that are currently running the VM-exit
handler (where the VM is exited to give control to the kernel or user space to handle a
request).</p>

<p>Liran Alon and Alexandre Chartre gave a talk on "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmvY/kvm-address-space-isolation-alexandre-chartre-liran-alon-oracle">KVM
Address Space Isolation (ASI)</a>", which is a feature that introduces a separate
virtual address space for VM-exit handlers.  Previous mitigations
excluded data from the virtual address space, but it is difficult to
identify all of the
sensitive data.  KVM ASI is a whitelist approach that builds a virtual
address space
with only the data actually required by KVM's VM-exit handlers.</p>

<p>Thomas Lendacky covered the status of the AMD Secure Encrypted
Virtualization (SEV) CPU feature in "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/Tmwl/improving-and-expanding-sev-support-thomas-lendacky-amd">Improving
and Expanding SEV Support</a>".  SEV protects VMs from an untrusted
hypervisor such as when deploying a VM on a public cloud. Guest memory is
encrypted so that the hypervisor cannot inspect or modify its contents.  Lendacky
discussed current developments with SEV such as eliminating memory
pinning, live migration, and SEV with encrypted state (SEV-ES).</p>

<p>SEV live migration uses separate encryption keys for the source and
destination VM and the keys are not migrated. The firmware requires a copy
of encrypted memory and special transport keys are used for moving pages
between hosts.</p>

<p>For SEV performance reasons, guest memory is currently pinned. Pinning
memory is 
undesirable because it prevents swapping and overcommitting. Options to eliminate
guest-memory pinning by preventing page movement (migration/swapping) and
SEV firmware-related work to copy encrypted pages are being
investigated. Future work also includes support for SEV-ES for encryption of VM
registers and SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging).</p>

<p>Recently, s390 joined the list of architectures implementing encryption
or protection of virtual 
machines. In "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/Tmve/protected-virtual-machines-for-s390x-claudio-imbrenda-ibm">Protected
Virtual Machines for s390x</a>", Claudio Imbrenda gave an overview of
this architecture. The hypervisor is considered untrusted, so the only
trusted entity in the system is the "ultravisor" that is implemented in
hardware and firmware. It decrypts and verifies the boot image for
"protected guests", and proxies interactions between the hypervisor
and guests. The hypervisor may not access any of the protected guest's
memory other than what that guest shared with it for I/O. The s390
code was able to reuse a lot of the infrastructure that had already been
introduced for AMD SEV.</p>

<h4>VFIO and mdev</h4>

<p>The <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/vfio.html">VFIO
driver</a> in Linux exposes physical PCI adapters and other devices to
applications. VFIO is used by user-space device drivers in software-defined
networking applications and in VMMs such as QEMU to pass physical PCI
adapters through to guests. Now an ecosystem of additional drivers built
on top of VFIO is enabling additional use cases.</p>

<p>In "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmvP/toward-a-virtualization-world-built-on-mediated-pass-through-kevin-tian-intel">Toward
a Virtualization World Built on Mediated Pass-Through</a>", Kevin Tian
presented an overview of this growing ecosystem that builds on the VFIO and
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/vfio-mediated-device.html">mediated device framework</a> (mdev) drivers in Linux. While VFIO exposes
physical devices to user space, the mdev framework makes it possible to
write pure software devices or to combine hardware and software
functionality. This can be used to add software logic on top of hardware,
for example, to work around hardware limitations or to present a subset of the
functionality embodied in the hardware.</p>

<p>One of these new VFIO/mdev applications was presented in more detail by
Xin Zeng and Yi Liu in their talk "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/Tmwu/bring-a-scalable-iov-capable-device-into-linux-world-xin-zeng-yi-liu-intel">Bring
a Scalable IOV Capable Device into Linux World</a>". Data-center PCI
adapters sometimes support PCI <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization">single-root
I/O virtualization</a> (SR-IOV), a feature that splits the adapter
into virtual function (VF) child devices that can be individually passed
through to guests. This allows multiple virtual machines to safely share
access to a PCI adapter, although only a subset of resources is available
through each VF. The newer scalable I/O virtualization approach replaces
the hardware SR-IOV feature with an mdev software driver that decides which
hardware resources to pass through directly and which ones to emulate in
software.</p>

<p>Another aspect of mediated devices was presented by Thanos Makatos and
Swapnil Ingle in their "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmvV/muser-mediated-user-space-device-thanos-makatos-swapnil-ingle-nutanix">muser:
Mediated User Space Device</a>" presentation. Muser is an mdev kernel
driver and associated libmuser user-space library for implementing device
emulation programs in user space. A program using the libmuser API can
implement a VFIO-capable PCI device in software. QEMU and other VMMs can
then pass this device through to a guest. Both C and Python bindings were
presented for writing software PCI devices in user space. The API revolves
around registering a PCI device description and then handling device
accesses either through callbacks or by polling <tt>mmap()</tt>-ed register space
when performance is critical. The device emulation program can define the
PCI Base Address Registers (BARs), configuration space, and other standard
PCI functionality in order to emulate existing or custom PCI devices.</p>

<h4>Micro VMs and new VMMs</h4>

<p>In the last few years, containers and micro-services have become more
and more popular.  Cloud users and providers are looking at virtual
machines to increase the security and isolation of these workloads, and
several sessions presented KVM-based solutions.</p>

<p>In "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmwZ/firecracker-lessons-from-the-trenches-andreea-florescu-alexandra-iordache-amazon">Firecracker:
Lessons from the Trenches</a>", Andreea Florescu and Alexandra Iordache
presented a lightweight VMM written in Rust: <a
href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">Firecracker</a>. It is
designed for multi-tenant cloud workloads like containers and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service">functions as
a service</a> (FaaS). Its key features are minimal boot time, low memory footprint,
and over-subscription of CPUs and memory. Each Firecracker process handles
a single micro-VM and uses <tt>chroot()</tt>, control groups, and seccomp
to delimit security 
boundaries.  Rust allowed them to write more reliable code, but Florescu
and Iordache described a few bugs that crept through, including an integer 
overflow that caused Firecracker to potentially run afoul of undefined
behavior.</p>

<p>Continuing on the Rust theme, Alibaba, AWS, CloudBase, Google, Intel, and Red
Hat have collaborated on <a
href="https://github.com/rust-vmm/community">rust-vmm</a>, which is a collection of
Rust crates for virtualization software. Florescu and Samuel Ortiz
talked about that in "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/Tmvq/playing-lego-with-virtualization-components-andreea-florescu-amazon-samuel-ortiz-intel">Playing
Lego with Virtualization Components</a>". They explained that Rust's key
features (memory safety, safe concurrency, and great performance) fit
well with the VMM requirements.  Some examples of components provided by
rust-vmm are API bindings (KVM, VirtIO, VFIO), a memory model, a kernel
loader, and several utility libraries.</p>

<p>In "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/Tmx9/bring-qemu-to-micro-service-world-xiao-guangrong-zhang-yulei-tencent-cloud">Bring
QEMU to Micro Service World</a>", Xiao Guangrong and Zhang Yulei described
how they used QEMU to launch micro-services extremely quickly. Their
solution, called QEMU basepoint, bypasses QEMU and guest 
initialization.  Using the existing QEMU migration feature, it saves the
state of the VM into a template file just after it starts. Then 
it uses this basepoint to launch new VMs.  To save QEMU initialization
time as well, the new VMs are handled by a fork of the base QEMU process.
This solution allows them to reduce the boot time, but it still has
limitations, such as the lack of kernel address-space layout randomization,
that will be addressed in the future.</p>

<h4>Nested virtualization</h4>

<p>Nested virtualization is the idea of running virtual machines inside other
virtual machines via the same or a different hypervisor. With the
popularity of cloud infrastructure, which typically uses virtualization,
the kernel is frequently already running on top of another hypervisor, so
nested virtualization is needed to run KVM. Nested
virtualization has therefore become important for development, continuous
integration (CI), and
production environments running in the cloud. Two talks at KVM Forum looked
at testing these setups from different 
perspectives.

<p>In "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmxC/managing-matryoshkas-testing-nested-guests-marc-hartmayer-ibm">Managing
Matryoshkas: Testing Nested Guests</a>", Marc Hartmayer presented an
approach for testing deeply nested setups (up to seven levels) using
existing Python test infrastructure via the <a
href="https://avocado-framework.github.io/">Avocado testing
framework</a>. He used the <a
href="https://mitogen.networkgenomics.com/">Mitogen</a> library
to run Python code remotely on the guest, reusing existing
virtualization tests on nested guests. A short demo showed that this
setup is easy to extend and information on test results is easy to
obtain even for more deeply nested guests. Hartmayer used the
Avocado-vt plugin for his implementation, but integration with
the simpler Avocado-QEMU infrastructure (already in use in QEMU's
acceptance test suite) should be doable once the needed Mitogen changes
have hit upstream.</p>

<p>In "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmwW/nestingtesting-vitaly-kuznetsov-red-hat">Nesting&amp;testing</a>"
Vitaly Kuznetsov looked in some detail at how nested virtualization on x86
is tested today. Two testing frameworks complement each other:
kvm-unit-tests, which makes use of QEMU to run tests, and
kvm-selftests, which uses custom user-space tooling to allow testing
corner cases at the price of making the tests more complicated to
write. Furthermore, testing can use tests specifically written to test
nested functionality, or it can run preexisting virtualization tests
under a hypervisor; the latter is for example how KVM under Hyper-V is
tested.</p>

<p>Looking at the tests currently available, VMX for Intel CPUs has a lot of tests
in what Kuznetsov labeled the "correctness", "functional", and "regression"
test categories in kvm-unit-tests; SVM for AMD CPUs, however, has very few
tests, mostly in the "functional" category. For kvm-selftests, the situation for AMD
CPUs looks even more dire, as there is currently no support for SVM at all;
SVM certainly can do with some more love.</p>

<p>Other than adding more tests, integrating running the tests already available
into some kind of CI is obviously a good idea; especially as this enables
running them in more nested environments, including Hyper-V/Azure, which not
everybody may have easy access to.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>This covers the main themes at KVM Forum 2019. A number of interesting
talks explored other areas and are <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3ep1uCIRfwwtvUS1Pco6Y0X-5tykpyG">available
for watching online</a> (along with all the presentations). It is a safe bet
that side-channel attack mitigations will remain a topic at <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kvm-forum/">KVM Forum 2020</a> in
Dublin, Ireland next year and that the VFIO/mdev ecosystem will grow as
both hardware vendors and software takes advantage of its capabilities. The
presence of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Tencent, and Huawei underscored how
pervasive KVM has become in cloud hosting and that its use will continue to
grow in the foreseeable future.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The exact same feature has been around for years in hyperhq's [runv](<a href="https://github.com/hyperhq/runv">https://github.com/hyperhq/runv</a>) and kata-containers(<a href="https://github.com/kata-containers/runtime">https://github.com/kata-containers/runtime</a>).

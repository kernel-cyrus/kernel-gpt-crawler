           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 26, 2014</br>
           </div>
<a href="/Articles/586838/">Last week's article on C11 atomic variables</a>
covered the discussion on the apparent mismatch between what the C11
standard defines and the kernel needs.  This discussion did not
conveniently end with the publication of the article, though.  So this
followup looks at the ground that was covered since then, with a particular
focus on the "consume" memory order.  It is possible, though far from
guaranteed, that the outcome of this discussion could lead to changes in
the standard to make it more applicable to kernel use.
<p>
<h4>An introduction to consume</h4>
<p>
Much of the work around memory ordering relates to two modes of operation called
"acquire" and "release".  <a
href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order">This page</a>
describes the meaning of these models within the standard.  In short: a
read from memory with "acquire" semantics is guaranteed to happen before
any subsequent reads or writes in the same thread.  A write with "release"
semantics will happen (become globally visible) after any preceding reads
or writes.  The two are typically used together.  Code that modifies a data
structure will perform the final write (the one that makes any other data it
wrote 
accessible globally) with a "release" operation, while code consuming that
data will read the pointer to the data with an "acquire" operation.
<p>
Acquire and release are useful concepts when trying to figure out how to
work with shared data in a lockless manner.  But in many cases an acquire
operation 
provides stronger ordering than is really necessary.  Reading with acquire
semantics imposes ordering on <i>all</i> subsequent reads and stores, even
if many of those operations do not depend on the value that was read and
could be 
more freely reordered by either the compiler or the processor.  There is
one case 
in particular in the kernel where it would be nice to have weaker (and
cheaper) ordering guarantees than acquire provides.
<p>
That case has to do with the read-copy-update (RCU) operation.  The <a
href="/Kernel/Index/#Read-copy-update">LWN kernel index</a> includes many
articles on the details of RCU; to simplify
things greatly here, for the purposes of this article it is hopefully
enough to say that RCU works by putting potentially
volatile data into
structures that are accessed via pointers.  Changing the data involves
allocating a 
new structure, copying the new data into it, then updating the pointer to
point to the new structure.  Code consuming that data will see either the
older or the newer pointer, depending on the relative timing of things, but
either will be valid at the time.  It is important, though, that the data
written to the new structure all be globally visible before the pointer to
that structure becomes visible; otherwise a consuming thread could end up
reading the wrong information.
<p>
This requirement can be met by assigning the pointer with release ordering,
and reading the pointer (usually done with <tt>rcu_dereference()</tt>) with
acquire ordering.  But the only ordering that really matters is that
between obtaining the pointer and accessing the contents of the structure
it points to.  On many
processors, that ordering comes for free, with no expensive memory barriers
required at all.
<p>
Providing this weaker ordering is the role of the "consume" ordering, which
only ensures that writes that are "dependent" on the read value must be
visible.  So in code that looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    p = rcu_dereference(pointer);
    q = p-&gt;something;
    *a = something_else;
</pre>
<p>
With acquire ordering, the assignment to <tt>*a</tt> could not be reordered
to happen before the <tt>rcu_dereference()</tt> call; with consume
ordering, instead, that reordering could be done, and, on some
architectures at least, the run-time cost of ensuring that ordering would
be lower (or zero).  Given that techniques like RCU are used in places
where performance matters greatly, the extra performance obtained through
the use of consume semantics seems worth having.

<p>
<h4>Fixing consume</h4>
<p>
The problem with consume ordering as defined by the standard is that it
requires extensive tracking of dependencies between data accesses.  That
tracking, it seems, is hard to understand and hard to do.  The result is a
standard text that is not entirely approachable to developers.  There are
also <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59448">reported
bugs</a> in GCC indicating that the handling of consume ordering is not
always done correctly.  With some compilers, it seems, consume is just
implemented as acquire, leading to correct results but losing the
performance advantages that consume is supposed to provide.
<p>
These problems make consume ordering sufficiently difficult to use
in the kernel that, chances are, the kernel will continue to use its
current mix of architecture-dependent macros and barriers.  But what if
the definition of consume ordering could be tweaked in the standard itself?
There are (probably) few users of consume now, and many implementations
likely just implement it as if it were acquire, so there may be scope for
changes.
<p>
Linus has <a href="/Articles/588312/">an idea</a> for a change that, he
thinks, would solve most of the problems.  He would like to get rid of the
extensive language describing dependencies and their tracking and replace
it with something simpler.  His suggested wording is:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The consume ordering guarantees the ordering between that atomic
	read and the accesses to the object that the pointer points to
	directly or indirectly through a chain of pointers.
</div>
<p>
The idea here is simple and, in theory, it provides just the ordering that RCU
needs.  There are some interesting subtleties, though.  The "chain of
pointers" concept, for example, refers to assignments and simple
modifications.  So with an assignment like:
<p>
<pre>
    p = rcu_dereference(something);
</pre>
<p>
These assignments would create pointers in the chain:
<p>
<pre>
    q = p;
    r = p + 1;
</pre>
<p>
What the "chain" idea explicitly does not cover is aliases.  If some other
pointer in the function happens to point to the object that <tt>p</tt>
points to, accesses to that object via the second pointer will not be
ordered in any way.
That makes Linus's idea of consume semantics different from
that found in the standard; the latter requires the compiler to try to
catch and handle that kind of aliasing.
<p>
But what really makes up a "chain of pointers"?  Paul McKenney, who would
be the person who would have to try to sell any such concept to the
standard committee, posted <a href="/Articles/588314/">a set of twelve
rules</a> describing how these chains would be formed.  There is an attempt
to distinguish between pairs of operations like this (for example):
<p>
<pre>
    q = p &amp; ~0x1;
    r = p &amp; 0x1;
</pre>
<p>
This kind of logical AND operation is often found in the kernel; the lowest
bits of pointers are sometimes used as flags to carry additional
information about the pointer.  The assignment of <tt>q</tt> above should
preserve the dependency chain, while the assignment of <tt>r</tt> would
not.  Compilers can often detect assignments like that second one, which
produces an integer value, not a pointer, and reorder them in surprising
ways.
<p>
It turns out that there are a lot of ways that one can destroy the
essential "pointerness" of a pointer and break the dependency chain.  In
fact, there are so many that Linus <a href="/Articles/588315/">advised</a>
(to put it politely) Paul to give up on trying to describe them:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So *accept* the fact that some operations (and I guarantee that
	there are more of those than you can think of, and you can create
	them with various tricks using pretty much *any* feature in the C
	language) essentially take the data information away. And just
	accept the fact that then the ordering goes away too.
</div>
<p>
An example he gave was:
<p>
<pre>
    p = atomic_read(pp, consume);
    if (p == &amp;variable)
        return p-&gt;val;
</pre>
<p>
In this case, he said, the compiler could reasonably turn
<tt>p-&gt;val</tt> into <tt>variable.val</tt>.  At that point, there is no
chain of pointers and no ordering; the read of <tt>variable.val</tt> could
conceivably happen before the atomic read.  If, instead, the <tt>==</tt>
were to be changed to <tt>!=</tt>, the chain (and the ordering of the
operations) would be preserved because there is no way for the compiler to
know where <tt>p</tt> might point.
<p>
<h4>Toward the standard?</h4>
<p>
After reading Linus's description, Paul <a href="/Articles/588429/">tried
to write down the requirements</a> again, and came up with this summary:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Therefore, the only operations that can be counted on to
	maintain the needed RCU orderings are those where the compiler
	really doesn't have any choice, in other words, where any
	reasonable way of computing the result will necessarily maintain
	the needed ordering.
</div>
<p>
Linus more-or-less <a href="/Articles/588430/">agreed</a> that this is the
case:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So I think the C semantics should mirror what the hardware gives us
	- and do so even in the face of reasonable optimizations - not try
	to do something else that requires compilers to treat "consume"
	very differently.
</div>
<p>
He did go on to confess, though, that what he really wants is something
like what Intel hardware provides.  If he were the king of the
world, he said, he would outlaw the weaker ordering provided by
architectures like ARM and PowerPC.  
<p>
And that ties into <a href="/Articles/588432/">one of Paul's biggest
concerns</a>: will we be able to count on hardware providing the relatively
strong Intel-style ordering in the future?  Optimization techniques have
advanced considerably over the years and will likely continue to do so.
Paul wondered: "<q>Are ARM and Power really the bad boys here?  Or are
they instead playing the role of the canary in the coal mine?</q>"  If
the latter is true, then building a memory ordering regime around Intel's
rules might prove hard to sustain over the long term.
<p>
Responses so far suggest that others do not expect weaker ordering to hold
in the long term; as <a href="/Articles/588434/">George Spelvin put it</a>,
once a processor adds the cache-coherency hardware to support other types
of advanced optimization, it has the capability to provide stronger
ordering anyway.  Programming on systems with weaker memory ordering is
harder, and thus more costly; there will come a time, some think, when
those costs clearly are not justified if the ability to provide stronger
ordering is available.
<p>
Predicting the long-term future of computing hardware is hard, of course,
and, meanwhile, systems with weaker ordering are around and must be
supported.  If Linus's model of consume semantics were to prevail, it could
be supported on such hardware now with the use of appropriate memory
barriers.  But predicting whether Linus's vision might ever make it into a
standard revision is just as hard.  It might just have a persuasive
champion who could present it to the committee in the proper language, but
standard committees move in strange, mysterious, and slow ways.  So this
could be a story that plays out over years; in the meantime, the kernel
will almost certainly not switch to C11 atomic variables for anything
that benefits from consume-style semantics.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The cache coherence messaging costs of strong Intel ordering surely will become ever harder to bear as the number of cores continues to increase? In addition to the costs of strong ordering on per-core performance through speculative execution, which Paul seemed to worry about. The latter is possibly less of a concern, as speculative execution no longer is how CPU designers try to eek out performance this way.<br>

"q" is still a pointer, "r" is no more a pointer...<br>
This week, I just tried (p pointing to a very big memory block):<br>
extern void *p;<br>
void *P = (p &amp; 0xFFFFFC3F) | ((p &amp; 0x300) &gt;&gt; 2)  | ((p &amp; 0xC0) &lt;&lt; 2);<br>
and use *P instead of *p to see if the memory cache (64 bytes line) had<br>
influence on the speed of the code...<br>
Complex operations on an address may result in an address.<br>

Assuming p is actually a pointer (e.g. void *) because it is something we want to derefererence later like an RCU structure, I think the type system already takes care of this as neither of the above compile... <br>
<p>
$ cat | gcc -c -x c -<br>
void func(void *p)<br>
{<br>
        void *r, *q;<br>
<p>
        r = p &amp; 1;<br>
        q = p &amp; ~1;<br>
}<br>
&lt;stdin&gt;: In function â€˜funcâ€™:<br>
&lt;stdin&gt;:5:15: error: invalid operands to binary &amp; (have â€˜void *â€™ and â€˜intâ€™)<br>
&lt;stdin&gt;:6:15: error: invalid operands to binary &amp; (have â€˜void *â€™ and â€˜intâ€™)<br>
<p>
For the first form you probably want something along the lines of:<br>
<p>
r = (unsigned long)p &amp; 1;<br>
<p>
It seems that applying the required casting to get a numeric value should naturally change the type and any dependency chain end there.<br>
<p>
This could catch out code which converts a pointer into a value and back again, but that could be re-written as pointer arithmetic or perhaps punned through a union without changing the type of the expression and dropping the chain.<br>

<h1>NAPI polling in kernel threads</h1>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 9, 2020</br>
           </div>
Systems that manage large amounts of network traffic end up dedicating a
significant part of their available CPU time to the network stack itself.
Much of this work is done in software-interrupt context, which can be
problematic in a number of ways.  That may be about to change, though,
once <a href="/ml/netdev/20201002222514.1159492-1-weiwan@google.com/">this
patch series</a> posted by Wei Wang is merged into the mainline.
<p>
Once a packet arrives on a network interface, the kernel must usually
perform a fair amount of protocol-processing work before the data in that
packet can be delivered to the user-space application that is waiting for
it.  Once upon a time, the network interface would interrupt the CPU when a
packet arrived; the kernel would acknowledge the interrupt, then trigger a
software interrupt to perform this processing work.  The problem with this
approach is that, on busy systems, thousands of packets can arrive every
second; handling the corresponding thousands of hardware interrupts can run
the system into the ground.
<p>
The solution to this problem <a href="/Articles/30107/">was merged in
2003</a> in the form of a mechanism that was called, at the time, "new
API" or "NAPI".  Drivers that support NAPI can disable the packet-reception
interrupt most of the time and rely on the network stack to poll for new
packets at a frequent interval.  Polling may seem inefficient, but on busy
systems there will always be new packets by the time the kernel polls for
them; the driver can then process all of the waiting packets at once.  In
this way, one poll can replace dozens of hardware interrupts.
<p>
NAPI has evolved considerably since 2003, but one aspect remains the same:
it still runs in software-interrupt mode.  These interrupts, once queued by
the kernel, will be processed at either the next return from a hardware
interrupt or the next return from kernel to user mode.  They thus run in an
essentially random context, stealing time from whatever unrelated process
happens to be running at the time.  Software interrupts are hard for system
administrators to manage and can create surprising latencies if they run
for a long time.  For this reason, kernel developers have wanted to reduce
or eliminate their use for years; they are an old mechanism that is deeply
wired into core parts of the kernel, though, and are hard to get rid of.

</blockquote>
<p>
Wang's patch set (which contains work from Paolo Abeni, Felix Fietkau, and
Jakub Kicinski) doesn't eliminate software interrupts, but it is a possible
step in that direction.  With these patches applied, the kernel can
optionally (under administrator control) create a separate kernel thread
for each NAPI-enabled network interface.  After that, NAPI polling will be
done in the context of that thread, rather than in a software interrupt.
<p>
The amount of work that needs to be done is essentially unchanged with this
patch set, but the change in the way that work is done is significant.
Once NAPI polling moves to its own kernel thread, it becomes much more
visible and subject to administrator control.  A kernel thread can have its
priority changed, and it can be bound to a specific set of CPUs; that
allows the administrator to adjust how that work is done in relation to the
system's user-space workload.  Meanwhile, the CPU scheduler will have a better
understanding of how much CPU time NAPI polling requires and can avoid
overloading the CPUs where it is running.  Time spent handling software
interrupts, instead, is nearly invisible to the scheduler.
<p>
There aren't a lot of benchmark results posted with the patch set; those
that are available indicate a possible slight increase in overhead when the
threaded mode is used.  Users who process packets at high rates tend to
fret over every nanosecond, but even they might find little to quibble
about if these results hold.  Meanwhile, those users should also see more
deterministic scheduling for their user-space code, which is also
important.
<p>
The networking developers seem to be generally in favor of this work; Eric
Dumazet <a
href="/ml/netdev/CANn89iJDM97U15Znrx4k4bOFKunQp7dwJ9mtPwvMmB4S+rSSbA@mail.gmail.com/">indicated</a>
a desire to merge it quickly.  This feeling is not unanimous, though;
Kicinski, in particular, <a
href="/ml/netdev/20200930130839.427eafa9@kicinski-fedora-pc1c0hjn.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">dislikes
the kernel-thread implementation</a>.  He believes that better performance
can be had by using the kernel's workqueue mechanism for the polling rather
than threads.  Dumazet <a
href="/ml/netdev/CANn89iK2-Wu8HMkWiD8U3pdRbwj2tjng-4-fJ81zVw_a3R6OqQ@mail.gmail.com/">answered</a>
that workqueues would not perform well on "<q>server class
platforms</q>" and indicated a lack of desire to wait to see a new
workqueue-based implementation at some point in the future.
<p>
So it appears that this work will be merged soon; it's late for 5.10, so
landing in the 5.11 kernel seems likely.  It's worth noting that the
threaded mode will remain off by default.  Making the best use of it will
almost certainly require system tuning to ensure that the NAPI threads are
able to run without interfering with the workload; for now, administrators
who are unwilling or unable to do that tuning are probably well advised to
stick with the default, software-interrupt mode.  Software interrupts
themselves are still not going away anytime soon, but this work may help in
the long-term project of moving away from them.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

IMHO, this would also be very helpful in making !RT and RT kernels closer...<br>
<p>
PREEMPT_RT already runs softirqs in their own kernel threads, so that they can be prioritized and not affect random victims and real-time threads. Maybe, soon, all mainline kernels will be like RT in that regard ;-)<br>

Yes of course. My point was that RT runs almost all softirqs at kthread/task context, not just NAPI. Thus, RT handles the generic case (almost all softirqs), while the patch set mentioned in the article only handles one of its special cases (NAPI).<br>

I may even be able to find my slides somewhere. There was a lot of skepticism about this approach (even from Eric Dumazet), but like threaded interrupts in general, I was confident that this would sooner or later be something that non RT folks would want.<br>

Those of us who care most about performance and minimizing overhead are using &quot;kernel-bypass&quot; libraries with NICs that dump incoming packets into a ring buffer mapped into user-space memory. The kernel driver for such a NIC sets up filter criteria programmed into registers in an ASIC or FPGA on the NIC, and then leaves it to run freely DMAing incoming packets sequentially into the ring buffer interspersed with annotations like length, timestamp, and checksum, and updates an atomic shared index/pointer when the packet is ready.<br>
<p>
The user program just needs to poll for updates to this index, and then finish all its work on the packet before it gets overwritten, as little as a few ms later. That work might be just to copy the packet to a bigger ring buffer for other processes to look at under more-relaxed time constraints.<br>
<p>
The kernel driver watches its own mapping of such a ring buffer, and copies out packets that processes have expressed interest in to regular buffers to be delivered, or to be processed according to TCP protocol, e.g. to acknowledge, or to run them past the firewall first.<br>

You mean like DPDK?<br>
<p>
Any reason not to mention any specific example(s)?<br>

I don&#x27;t think they are referring to DPDK. It&#x27;s rather about solutions such as SolarFlare NICs and kernel bypass with OpenOnload.<br>
It&#x27;s extremely popular in fintech and other latency sensitive fields.<br>
<p>
I can&#x27;t wait to get rid of softirqs from my critical CPUs. Those and tasklets are a nightmare when you&#x27;re trying to reduce platform jitter to the minimum.<br>

Agreed, I don&#x27;t have any direct experience with DPDK. I have used Onload/Ef_vi for Solarflare hardware (sold by Xilinx, maybe soon AMD), libexanic for Exablaze hardware (sold by Cisco now), and Napatech. I have studied Netronome, which enables running eBPF on the packet before it hits host memory, that can drop the packet at that stage.<br>
<p>
Each has its own idiosyncratic filtering configuration and ring buffer layout. ExaNIC is unusual in delivering packets 120 bytes at a time, enabling partial processing while the rest of the packet is still coming in.<br>
<p>
There are various accommodations to use in VMs, which I have not experimented with.<br>
<p>
Keeping the kernel&#x27;s greedy fingers off of my cores is one of the harder parts of the job. It means lots of custom boot parameter incantations, making deployment to somebody else&#x27;s equipment a chore. It would be much, much better if the process could simply tell the kernel, &quot;I will not be doing any more system calls, please leave my core completely alone from this point&quot;, and have that stick. Such a process does all its subsequent work entirely via mapped memory. <br>

It sounds like it can be toggled through sysfs. So much better than having to (re)compile the kernel. :)<br>

About time. Having packets processed in high priority software IRQs is a gift to those who want to carry out denial of service attacks against CPU limited embedded processors.<br>

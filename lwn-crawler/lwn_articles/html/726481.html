           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 26, 2017</br>
           </div>
Persistent memory promises high-speed, byte-addressable access to storage,
with consequent benefits for all kinds of applications.  But realizing those
benefits has turned out to present a number of challenges for the Linux
kernel community.  Persistent memory is neither ordinary memory nor
ordinary storage, 
so traditional approaches to memory and storage are not always well suited
to this new world.  A proposal for a new <tt>daxctl()</tt> system call,
along with the ensuing discussion, shows how hard it can be to get the most
out of persistent memory.
<p>
The "DAX" mechanism allows an application to map a file in
persistent-memory storage directly into its address space, bypassing the
kernel's page cache.  Thereafter, data in the file can be had via a
pointer, with no need for I/O operations or copying the data through
RAM.  So far, so good, but there is a catch: this mode really only works
for applications that are reading data from persistent memory.  As soon as
the time comes to do a write, things get more complicated.  Writes can
involve the allocation of blocks on the underlying storage device; they
also create metadata updates that must be managed by the filesystem.  If
those metadata updates are not properly flushed out, the data cannot be
considered properly written.
<p>
The end result is that applications performing writes to persistent memory
must call <tt>fsync()</tt> to be sure that those writes will not be lost.
Even if the developer remembers to make those calls in all the right
places, <tt>fsync()</tt> can create an arbitrary amount of I/O and, thus,
impose arbitrary latencies on the calling application.  Developers who go
to the trouble of using DAX are doing so for performance reasons; such
developers tend to respond to ideas like "arbitrary latencies" with poor
humor at best.  So they have been asking for a better solution.
<p>
<h4>daxctl()</h4>
<p>
That is why Dan Williams wrote in the introduction to <a
href="/Articles/725699/">this patch series</a> that "<q>the full promise
of byte-addressable access to persistent memory has only been half realized
via the filesystem-dax interface</q>".  Realizing the other half
requires getting the filesystem out of the loop when it comes to write
access.  If, say, a file could be set up so that no metadata changes would
be needed in response to writes, the problem would simply go away.
Applications would be able to write to DAX-mapped memory and, as long as
they ensured that their own writes were flushed to persistent store (which
can be done in user space with a couple of special instructions), there
should be no concerns about lost metadata.
<p>
Williams's proposal to implement this approach requires a couple of steps.
The first is that the application needs to call <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html"><tt>fallocate()</tt></a>
to ensure that the file of interest actually has blocks allocated in
persistent memory.  Then it has to tell the kernel that the file is to be
accessed via DAX and that the existing block allocations cannot be changed
under any circumstances.  That is done with a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int daxctl(char *path, int flags, int align);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>path</tt> indicates the file of interest, <tt>flags</tt>
indicates the desired action, and <tt>align</tt> is a hint regarding the
size of pages that the application would like to use.  The
<tt>DAXFILE_F_STATIC</tt> flag, if present, will put the file into the "no
changes allowed mode"; if the flag is absent, the file becomes an ordinary
file once again.  While the static mode is active, any operation on the
file that would force metadata changes (changing its length with
<tt>truncate()</tt>, for example) will fail with an error code.
<p>
The implementation of this new mode would seem to require significant
changes at the filesystem level, but it turns out that this functionality
already exists.  It is used by the swap subsystem which, when swapping to
an ordinary file, needs to know where the blocks allocated to the file
reside on disk.  There are two pieces to this mechanism, the first of which
is this <tt>address_space_operations</tt> method:
<p>
<pre>
    /* Unfortunately this kludge is needed for FIBMAP. Don't use it */
    sector_t (*bmap)(struct address_space *s, sector_t sector);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>bmap()</tt> will return the physical block number on which
the given <tt>sector</tt> is located; the swap subsystem uses this
information to swap pages directly to the underlying device without
involving the filesystem.  To ensure that the list of physical blocks
corresponding to the swap file does not change, the swap subsystem sets the
<tt>S_SWAPFILE</tt> inode flag on the file.  Tests sprinkled throughout the
virtual filesystem layer (and the filesystems themselves) will block any
operation that would change the layout of a file marked with this flag.
<p>
This functionality is a close match to what DAX needs to make direct writes
to persistent memory safe.  So the <tt>daxctl()</tt> system call has simply
repurposed this mechanism, putting the file into the no-metadata-changes
mode while not actually swapping to it.
<p>
<h4>MAP_SYNC</h4>
<p>
Christoph Hellwig was not slow to register his opposition to this idea.  He
would rather not see the <tt>bmap()</tt> method used anywhere else in the
kernel; it is, in his opinion, <a href="/Articles/726489/">broken in a
number of ways</a>.  Its use in swapping is also broken, he said, though
"<q>we manage to paper over the fact</q>".  He <a
href="/Articles/726490/">suggested</a> that development should be focused
instead on making DAX more stable before adding new features.
<p>
An alternative approach, <a href="/Articles/726492/">proposed</a> by Andy
Lutomirski, has been seen before: it was raised (under the name
<tt>MAP_SYNC</tt>) during the <a href="/Articles/678011/">"I know what I'm
doing" flag discussion</a> in early 2016.  The core idea here
is to get the filesystem to transparently ensure that any needed metadata
changes are always in place before an application is allowed to write to a page
affected by those changes.  That would be done by write-protecting the
affected pages, then flushing any needed changes as part of the process of
handling a 
write fault on one of those pages.  In theory, this approach would allow
for a lot of use cases blocked by the <tt>daxctl()</tt> technique,
including changing the length of files, copy-on-write semantics, concurrent
access, and more.  It's a seemingly simple idea that hides a lot of 
complexity; implementing it would not be trivial. 
<p>
Beyond implementation complexity, <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt> has another problem: it
runs counter to the original low-latency goal.  Flushing out the metadata
changes to a filesystem can be a lengthy and complex task, requiring
substantial amounts of CPU time and I/O.  Putting that work into the
page-fault handler means that page faults can take an arbitrarily long
amount of time.  As Dave Chinner <a href="/Articles/726494/">put it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Prediction for the MAP_SYNC future: frequent bug reports about
	huge, unpredictable page fault latencies on DAX files because every
	so often a page fault is required to sync tens of thousands of
	unrelated dirty objects because of filesystem journal ordering
	constraints.
</div>
<p>
There was some discussion about how the impact of doing metadata updates in
the page-fault handler could be reduced, but nobody has come forth with an
idea that would reduce it to zero.  Those (<a href="/Articles/726495/">such
as Hellwig</a>) who support the <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt> approach acknowledge that
cost, but see it 
as being preferable to adding a special-purpose interface that brings its
own management difficulties.
<p>
On the other hand, this work could lead to improvements to the swap
subsystem as well, making it more robust and more compatible with
filesystems (like Btrfs) whose copy-on-write semantics work poorly with the
"no metadata changes" idea.  There is another use case for this
functionality: high-speed DMA directly to persistent memory also
requires that the filesystem not make any unexpected changes to how the
file is mapped.  That, and the relative simplicity of Williams's patch, may
help to push the <tt>daxctl()</tt> mechanism through, even though it is not
universally popular.
<p>
Arguably, the real lesson from this discussion is that persistent memory is
not a perfect match to the semantics provided by the Unix API and current
filesystems.  It may eventually become clear that a different type of
interface is needed, at least for applications that want to get maximum
performance from this technology.  Nobody really knows what that interface
should look like yet, though, so the current approach of trying to retrofit
new mechanisms onto what we have now would appear to be the best way
forward.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      People are working on such things; <a href="https://github.com/Andiry/nova">NOVA</a> was mentioned in the discussion, for example.  But new filesystems take a long time even when the problem domain is fully understood, and some of the problems are likely to be hard to work around even when starting from scratch.  I expect people will get there, but it will take a fair while yet.

It looks like there are at least a couple of years to make a polished FS. And it should be easier than usual, since you literally have non-volatile memory for all the important structures: simple atomic operations instead of barriers, no mucking with block devices, etc.<br>

Alternatively why not work within the MTD subsystem, that has already support for Non-volatile addressable memories (NOR flash).  And already has a bunch of filesystems designed for them too...<br>

      NOR flash also has large-to-huge erase blocks. It is only byte addressable for reads, not for writes.
<br>Note also that NOR flash appears to be mostly dead outside the deeply-embedded market: the largest NOR-flash device you can purchase right now from Micron is 1&nbsp;Gb (that is 1&nbsp;giga-bit, or 128&nbsp;megabytes) while NAND-flash devices are now at 6&nbsp;Tb (6&nbsp;tera-bits, or 750&nbsp;gigabytes).

      Because the underlying need is broader than just DAX.
<p>
The underlying need is the ability to access a file using the storage address, without reference to the inode.
<br>
- swap-to-file uses this (though as we proved with NFS, it can be done differently)
<br>
- DMA-to-storage could use this. (The article mentions "high-speed DMA directly to persistent memory" but the email thread says
<p>
<pre>
         "I have this
	 high speed data aquisition hardware and we'd like to DMA data direct
	 to the storage because it's far too slow pushing it through memory
	 and then the OS to get it to storage. How do I map the storage
	 blocks and guarantee the mapping won't change while we are
	 transferring data direct from the hardware?".
</pre>
which isn't necessarily about persistent memory.
<p>
And DAX could benefit from this.
<p>
It really makes sense for the functionality to be included in existing filesystems where possible.

Sure. But it looks like the current attempt to shoehorn existing filesystems is not a good fit for it.<br>
<p>
After all, they were designed to ship data back and forth between memory and persistent block storage. So a lot of functionality is simply superfluous when you can directly access your storage. And some functionality of filesystems is clearly incompatible with direct access: encryption and data compression, for example. Journals and snapshots have to be designed differently and so on.<br>
<p>
With the current DAX efforts if looks like the case of leaking abstractions all the way. And use-cases like DMA to NVRAM only underscores it - you really need guarantees from the filesystem that don't exist right now. <br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; you really need guarantees from the filesystem that don't exist right now. </font><br>
<p>
True, but they are guarantees that once could have been assumed.  It is only these new-fangled filesystems, which try to be clever, that the requirement isn't trivial for.  Even for them it is just a case of not being too clever for those files, and carefully identifying all the places where cleverness might be a problem.  So no relocation of blocks, no sharing of blocks, no compression, etc.<br>
<p>
From my quick glance at the email thread, I felt that filesystem developers were generally happy to provide the functionality, but needed to agree on details of interface and specific functionality.  I particularly liked an idea from Dace Chinner to add a new flag to fallocate().  With this flag the space would be allocated and initialized, the metadata would be persisted, and the inode would be marked so that the storage allocations were immutable.  Then the file could be safely used with DAX or swap or whatever.  This requires metadata changes to the filesystem which the original patch from Dan appeared to try and avoid, but it is probably a change worth making.  If we defined the immutability as only until the file was truncated, then old filesystems could support the new fallocate() flag with no metadata change (I think Dave wanted the flag to imply that truncation was not allowed, which is probably the better choice if you don't care about old filesystems).<br>

I meant to also say: having to have multiple different filesystems for different uses is a royal pain.<br>
Being able to have multiple different filesystems is liberating.<br>
Being required to have them is quite the reverse.<br>
It is bad enough that we have /proc and /sys and /dev/pts and /dev/mqueue and /dev/hugepages and /sys/kernel/debug and /sys/fs/cgroup and .... instead of just one virtual filesystem exporting kernel stuff.  Don't make us have to have multiple different filesystems for storing different sorts of data too.<br>

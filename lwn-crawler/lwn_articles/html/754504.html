<p>
In a filesystem track session at the 2018 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM), Darrick Wong talked about the online
scrubbing and repair features he has been working on.  His target has mostly been
XFS, but he has concurrently been working on scrubbing for ext4.
Part of what he wanted to discuss was the possibility of standardizing some
of these interfaces across different filesystem types.
</p>

<p>
Filesystem scrubbing is typically an ongoing activity to try to find
corrupted data by periodically reading the data on the disk.  Online repair
attempts to fix the

problems found by using redundant information (or metadata that can be
calculated from other information) stored elsewhere in the filesystem.  As
described in <a href="/Articles/752182/">Wong's patch series</a>, both
scrubbing and repair are largely concerned with filesystem metadata, though
scrubbing data extents (and repairing them if possible) is also supported.
Wong said that XFS now has online scrubbing 
support, but 
does not quite have the online repair piece yet.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Btrfs has support for online scrubbing and ext4 will eventually as well.  Wong
wondered if there was an opportunity to create a common wrapper for user
space.  Ted Ts'o said that it would help if there was some clarity about the
goals and requirements of a scrubber tool.  He asked, is it a cron job that
scrubs 
all the filesystems or might there be individual crontab entries for ext4
and XFS?  Clearly the goal should be to make the system administrator's
life better.
</p>

<p>
Chris Mason brought up the CRC checks that the filesystems currently do.
When those CRC checks fail, each filesystem logs its own message to dmesg.
There is no consistency between the filesystems for that message.  Wong
recommended that Btrfs return a "filesystem corrupt" error status to user
space as ext4 
and XFS do, but Mason pointed out that CRC errors are not only found
during a filesystem scrubbing.
</p>

<p>
Kent Overstreet said that he had a framework that could be used for
long-running jobs in the kernel.  It returns a file descriptor that can be
used to monitor the job.  Wong said that the XFS scrubbing consists of many
<tt>ioctl()</tt> commands that are called from user space.  Overstreet said
that sounded harder to deal with.  Josef Bacik said that Btrfs is similar
to XFS, but that having a single file descriptor might be better.
</p>

<p>
Dave Chinner wondered if there was a way to have a single scrubbing command
that handled any kind of filesystem, so that users do not have to remember
how to do it for each type.  No one seemed opposed to the idea but getting
there may take some time.
</p>

<p>
When data errors are found, some users may not really want to have the
filesystem try to repair things, Ric Wheeler said.  Instead they will just
want the name of the file containing the error so that they can simply get
a copy from another server.  That 
requires mapping the blocks back to a path.  He also said that a recent
paper showed that, while SSDs will last a lot longer than rotating storage,
they will generate 
many more errors (on the order of 10-15 times more) than rotating storage over
that time.  So these kinds of problems will become more prevalent.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that needs to be standardized is the I/O priority that these
scanners will run with, Mason said. 

<p>
Wong suggested starting
with a simple common scrubbing wrapper that would do the right thing for each
filesystem type.  It would just report whether the metadata had errors and
whether the data had errors.  From that, administrators could then decide
how to fix the errors.  Chinner said that there needs to be some standard
on what 
errors get returned, but Wong suggested starting with something simple: 0
for OK, 1 to 
indicate a problem and that the administrator should check the logs for
more information.  It was generally agreed that would be a reasonable place
to start, though Ts'o cautioned there would be a need to eventually
standardize more pieces at multiple levels.

Also, of course, scrubbing is *online*, unlike fsck. It's not really quite the same thing. (But dispatching from a fscrub utility to individual fscrub.* tools seems like a good idea to me too.)<br>

It seems most systems have difficulty passing an error back up the chain when there's a problem short of an out-and-out failure.<br>
<p>
Raid, for example, could check majority voting if there's a mirror, or parity for raids 5 and 6. But at present, on a read, it just assumes everything is hunky-dory if the data blocks read okay. There is no mechanism for checking and indicating a problem. Okay, with a two-disk mirror or raid 5, there's nothing that can be done to fix an integrity error, but it would be nice to know it's happened. And if you know a disk is flaky it would be nice to be able to tell any fix utility to assume that's the problem. At present, the fix utilities assume by default it's the parity that's dud, so even with raid-6 an ill-informed "fix" will simply trash your data if that assumption isn't true.<br>

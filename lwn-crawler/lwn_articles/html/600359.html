<p>Recently things have pretty quiet for the interactive kernel debugging
tools, with kgdb and kdb combined receiving only four patches in the
last year. However, activity has started to pick up as new work inspired
by Android's out-of-tree fiq_debugger has been posted for
consideration. One of the key features proposed increases the robustness
of kdb and kgdb by making it much harder for bugs in the system under
test to prevent the user from invoking the debugger.</p>

<p>Both kgdb and kdb have been included in the kernel for a long time.
<a
href="http://landley.net/kdocs/Documentation/DocBook/xhtml-nochunks/kgdb.html#EnableKGDB">Kgdb</a>,
which is
a debug stub that allows another machine to connect a source-level
debugger over a serial link, was merged in 2.6.26, while <a href="http://landley.net/kdocs/Documentation/DocBook/xhtml-nochunks/kgdb.html#usingKDB">kdb</a>,
after a significant rewrite, was merged into 2.6.37. The rewrite
allowed kdb to reuse kgdb's breakpoint and polled I/O infrastructure in 
order to implement a machine-level kernel debugger that runs entirely 
on the machine being debugged.</p>

<p>On a PC, the main distinction between kdb and kgdb is that kdb can be
operated from the PC's own keyboard and display. This difference is less
obvious on embedded systems that seldom have their own keyboard.
However the property is retained; kdb is self hosting, requiring only a
terminal emulator, while kgdb requires a machine loaded up with the
developer tools and the corresponding <tt>vmlinux</tt> file.</p>

<p>Both of these debug tools share common infrastructure and they also
share a limitation: there are circumstances where other parts of the
kernel can mask interrupts, including the one from the serial port,
making it impossible for the user to manually stop the machine to debug
it. When that happens, the request to stop the system never makes it from
the serial port to the processor. A good example of this occurs if
<tt>spin_lock_irq()</tt> is used incorrectly by a faulty driver causing
a deadlock that cannot be studied with the debugger.</p>

<h4>ARM's fast interrupt (FIQ) support</h4>

<p>The ARM architecture includes two ways to interrupt the processor,
the normal interrupt (IRQ) and the fast interrupt (FIQ). The two forms
of interrupt have separate mask bits within the ARM processor status
register and Linux code seldom, if ever, sets the FIQ mask bit. The
processor also implements special features to reduce the overhead of FIQ
handling. For example, it has a separate bank of seven registers, five of
which can be used by the
FIQ handler without interfering with any normal CPU registers.  In addition, the FIQ vector is carefully placed within the exception
vector table so that its handler can be directly executed (all other ARM
exceptions must jump due to lack of space in the vector table). This
means an FIQ handler, if specially crafted to use only a few registers,
need not save or restore any state.  The combination of seldomly being
masked, reduced demultiplexing overhead (because few drivers employ FIQ), and
additional hardware features give fast interrupts their
name.</p>

<p>At the CPU level, the ARM FIQ signal is technically very similar to
the x86 non-maskable interrupt (NMI), but its role within the system
architecture has different historical roots. ARM FIQs were, as the name
suggests, designed to rapidly service demanding peripherals or even to
allow software to replace hardware (for example in synchronous serial
communication). This contrasts strongly with the PC world, where the NMI has
long been associated with diagnostics and other troubleshooting
techniques.  NMI was originally used in the IBM PC to report hardware
faults such as memory parity errors. Today, watchdogs built into PC
chipsets signal failure using NMI; server systems may even include a
physical NMI button that can be used to invoke diagnostic features.</p>

<p>Most ARM systems have interrupt controllers that allow any interrupt
source to be routed as either an IRQ or an FIQ. Occasionally, in embedded
ARM/Linux systems, this facility it used for its original purpose of
supporting a single peripheral with aggressive latency
requirements. For example, the Raspberry Pi kernel uses fast interrupts to
improve 
USB performance. However, it is much more common for the FIQ signal to never be
used at all. This makes it possible to route the UART (serial port)
interrupt to the FIQ signal, 
improving the robustness of communication between the UART and the
debugger. Since the FIQ is never masked, a faulty driver would no longer
be able to prevent the debugger operating normally simply by disabling
interrupts.</ p>

<h4>Android's fiq_debugger</h4>

<p>Google's Android team have already implemented an interactive
debugger that can, optionally, take advantage of FIQ interrupts.
<a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git/+/android-3.4/arch/arm/common/fiq_debugger.c">Fiq_debugger</a>
has a long history that dates back several years before kdb 
was merged into the kernel. Recently it was used in the  development of many of
Google's Nexus phones and tablets. On
these devices, the UART is connected either to the
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1461986">USB</a>
or
<a href="http://blog.accuvant.com/jduckandryan/building-a-nexus-4-uart-debug-cable/">headphone</a>
sockets. These UARTs are disabled during normal use but become active
when presence-detect resistors indicate that something is
listening to the UART.</p>

<p>On devices whose application processors can support it, fiq_debugger
receives and processes all user input and executes the majority of
commands from the FIQ handler. This makes it extremely robust against
driver bugs that leave the system unresponsive, although there are some
drawbacks. In particular, an FIQ can interrupt the kernel at more or less 
any point during kernel execution, including during critical sections. 
That means that certain debug commands cannot execute safely from the 
FIQ handler because they might conflict with the interrupted activity.
When running in the FIQ handler, even taking a spin lock can lead to a lock up
if the spin lock is held by an interrupted critical section.</p>

<p>To solve this, fiq_debugger can drop into normal interrupt handling using
ARM's software interrupt feature. This allows robust basic
commands (such as single CPU stack trace) to use the 
FIQ signal but also to be implemented alongside
richer, but slightly less robust, status-reporting features in the
same debugger.</p>

<p>Some ARM systems do not permit routing of the UART interrupt
from IRQ to FIQ. On these systems, the Android debugger remains useful 
to study a variety of system failures, but it does not retain the 
robustness of FIQ-based systems.</p>

<p>In addition to FIQ support, fiq_debugger contains some other
unusual features that distinguish it from the existing in-kernel debug
technologies. These features are motivated by the relatively hostile
environment the debugger might be deployed in.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>

    <li><p>The UART (and the associated presence-detect circuit) might
    be presented with
    <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1323496/focus=1323516">significant noise</a>
    due to the serial port being multiplexed with other activity. Noise must
    not cause the device to spuriously stop the world.</p></li>

    <li><p>The debugger may be deployed on devices with one or more external
    hardware watchdogs standing by ready to reset the system should it
    become stalled for any reason.</p></li>

    <li><p>The debugger may be deployed on production devices and cannot
    be used as a means to compromise user privacy. For example a hostile
    charging station or airline headphone service must not be able to
    access private user data.</p></li>
    
</ul>

<p>Fiq_debugger has two features to counter these issues.</p>

<p>First, fiq_debugger's command interpreter is asynchronous. All CPUs
continue to run while commands are received from the user and, on SMP
systems, all of the other CPUs continue to run as usual even during command
execution.  This contrasts with kdb, which
is a stop-the-world debugger. As soon as kdb is invoked, all CPUs in the
system are brought to a halt and the system will not resume normal
processing until the user issues a "go" command. 

<p>
Stop-the-world has many
advantages, in particular the system cannot change state while the user
is reasoning about it, however if the world were stopped accidentally
due to noise (for example when inserting headphones) then this looks to
the user as though the phone has crashed. In this situation, the
watchdog will come to the rescue of the normal user but at a terrible
cost. If a developer actually wants to stop the world, they will
find that the device resets ten seconds after they started debugging it 
because the watchdog fired. An asynchronous implementation keeps both 
users happy.</p>

<p>Second, fiq_debugger supports only a fairly limited set of built-in
commands. There are no general memory inspection commands and, apart
from magic-SysRq and reboot, there is no means to divert the device
from normal processing. The idea is that the passive inspection commands
that do exist (stack trace, process list, irq status, dmesg, and register
dump) give a reasonable chance of performing successful post-mortem
analysis without much risk of leaking the user's private data.</p>

<p>Fiq_debugger, like kdb, offers a command that switches to kgdb
mode and enables both arbitrary memory access and traditional
stop-the-world step/breakpoint debugging. This command is disabled by
default and can only be enabled by the root user.
Despite its interesting and unique features, it seems unlikely that
fiq_debugger will be merged into the kernel because its functionality
overlaps so significantly with that of kdb.</p>

<h4>Improving kgdb and kdb</h4>

<p>Inspired by the Android team's work on fiq_debugger, Anton Vorontsov of
Linaro developed a series of patches to implement some of the best ideas
from that debugger in kdb. This includes the NMI/FIQ patchset and 
the reduced capability series.</p>

<p>The NMI/FIQ patchset introduced a generic framework to support NMI-based
debuggers together with a concrete implementation for ARM that is based on FIQ.
The framework allows both kgdb and kdb to be triggered from non-maskable
interrupts, which brings the robustness of non-maskable debuggers to all
in-kernel debug technologies.</p>

<p>The
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1363754">generic framework</a>
provides a means for the NMI handler to deliver
characters to a special TTY driver that interacts with a real serial
port driver using its polled I/O interfaces. The TTY driver allows the
user to invoke kdb (or kgdb), but takes steps to avoid spuriously 
stopping the world due to noise by requiring a special "knock" to stop 
the system.</p>

<p>The framework was
<a href="/Articles/520001/">merged into 3.7</a> but,
unfortunately, the ARM-specific patches to take advantage of it never
were able to get reviewer or maintainer attention despite multiple
submissions. Anton moved on to other things and it falls to me
to
<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg334349.html">update them with support for multi-platform kernels</a>
and to
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1703588">fix bitrot since 3.7</a>.

<p>My work brings NMI/FIQ support to STMicroelectronics STiH415 and 
STiH416 devices, as well as support for the ARM Versatile platform. It
works well with multi-platform kernels, although Russell King has
<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg334390.html">identified some potential issues</a>
that require spin locks to be avoided within one of the 
interrupt controller callbacks. In the device tree portion of the patch, 
Srinivas Kandagatla
<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg334383.html">asked for better documentation</a>
of the new device tree bindings and King has
<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg334391.html">serious concerns</a>
about how FIQ-capable interrupt signals are described within device 
tree interrupt maps. Finally Colin Cross, one of the developers of
Android's fiq_debugger, has
<a
href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1676608/focus=1692875">previously noted</a>
the need for additional changes to kgdb to fully benefit from fast interrupts on SMP
platforms. In particular, the current code to stop the world uses an 
inter-processor IRQ to stop the other processors. That should be made
to use fast interrupts to fully benefit from the robustness improvements.</p>

<p>Supplementing the NMI/FIQ patchset is the
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1697818">reduced capability patchset</a>,
which is a means to restrict which classes of kdb commands can be used 
during a debug session. The permitted commands are set at boot and can be
modified by the root user while the system is running. This allows kdb 
to be set up with a similar range of commands as fiq_debugger has, although 
other combinations are also possible and can be used to target 
different use-cases.</p>

<h4>The impact of TrustZone on FIQ</h4>

<p>So far, we have assumed that the interrupt controller
provides a means to route the UART interrupt to the processor's FIQ signal
and that this signal is observable by the kernel. Unfortunately, for
modern ARM systems that implement TrustZone, this is not always the
case.</p>

<p><a
href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.prd29-genc-009492c/index.html">TrustZone</a>
is a security technology for ARM. It works by dividing the processor into
two virtual processors, each of which is considered to occupy a different
"world". Peripherals, including processor-intimate peripherals such as
the interrupt controller, can determine which world a memory access
originates from. This is used to implement hardware-based controls that
prevent the "normal world" virtual processor from interfering with the
operation of the "secure world".</p>

<p>ARM systems with TrustZone do not introduce new interrupt signals 
between the interrupt controller and the processor. Instead, the
processor will switch automatically from normal world to trusted world
in response to the FIQ signal, meaning only the IRQ signal can be used by
an operating system running in the normal world. The interrupt controller
supports this division by ignoring writes to the FIQ routing 
registers from the normal world and returning zero for all reads.</p>

<p>In typical systems that employ TrustZone, the secure monitor is booted
from a tamper-resistant bootloader and the kernel is later booted in normal
world. The kernel can interact with the secure monitor by using a special
Secure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction that operates in a similar manner
to a system call.</p>

<p>This means that a developer working on a kernel running in normal
world must rely on cooperation from the secure monitor to help pass FIQ
signals to the kernel. Unfortunately, features to support this are not
yet standardized and implemented in currently available secure monitors.
Thankfully. there are projects like
<a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware">ARM trusted firmware</a>
from ARM itself and the
<a href="http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-forms-security-working-group/">work on trusted execution environments</a>
by Linaro, STMicroelectronics, and NVIDIA to provide us with open-source 
infrastructure to prototype and develop interfaces between the kernel 
and the secure monitor. This should eventually open up the opportunity 
for developers to employ NMI-like debug techniques on almost all modern 
ARM systems.</p>

<h4>What's next?</h4>

<p>The NMI/FIQ patchset is relatively small, but conceals within it some
fairly significant behavioral changes. Not content with proposing big
changes to the default configuration of one of ARM's most common
interrupt controllers, it also causes all of the debugger code to run
from a non-maskable interrupt handler, thus imposing new restrictions on the
use of spin locks within the debugger implementation. This means a good 
bit of testing will be required in order to gain sufficient confidence 
for the patches to be merged.</p>

<p>Many types of testing are needed, from simple does-it-still-boot
regression testing right through to deliberately breaking the kernel and
checking that the debugger can still be invoked. For example, running 
these tests on SMP systems will reveal the limitations of the kgdb code 
to stop the world, which will allow it to get fixed.</p>

<p>To encourage wider testing, a port to the BeagleBone Black is planned,
although progress here has been frustrated slightly by the
<a href="http://beagleboard.org/blog/2014-04-13-dude-wheres-my-beaglebone-black/">worldwide shortage of boards</a>.
In the meantime, be aware that porting to a new board can be as little
as 31 lines of code if the interrupt controller is already supported.
That makes porting to other development boards a terrific way for an 
interested developer to get involved with this work.</p>

<p>It is too late for anything to
happen in the 3.16 merge window, but we can hope to see at least some of 
these patches making their way into 3.17.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; that hijack the phone they are plugged in ?</font><br>
<p>
Not really.<br>
<p>
fiq_debugger deliberately does not implement commands that could be used to hijack the phone and, within kgdb/kdb, the purpose of the reduced capability patchset is to achieve the same thing by disabling commands that could be to hijack the phone.<br>
<p>
For example, arbitrary memory reads can be banned to prevent fishing for cryptographic keys. Similarly breakpoints and single stepping can also be banned, which is an interesting case. Breakpointing might initially appear to be "passive observation" it can, in fact, be used to single step decryption routines such that the control flow might reveal the key.<br>
<p>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I wonder why they did not make the UART listen to the touchscreen</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; instead. Just swipe with the right fingerprint and you are set.</font><br>
<p>
Managing the touchscreen requires too much of the phone to be working correctly. The purpose of both fiq_debugger and kgdb/kdb+FIQ is to provide debug mechanisms that still function when significant portions of the kernel are not working correctly. For this reason they need to use very simple hardware.<br>

AFAIK, the BeagleBone (like other TI Cortex-A SoCs) does not support FIQs. They seems to be reserved for the ROM-code.<br>

Yes, on my Element14's BBB the boot ROM in the TI chip apparently switches the ARM CPU to "non-trusted" mode before jumping into the first bootloader code. Setting the FIQ bit (to disable FIQs) always fails silently.<br>

Thanks for this information (even if it is rather disappointing).<br>
<p>
I picked the BBB after checking the technical reference manual's section on the interrupt controller... sadly I neglected to check out how the boot ROM works.<br>
<p>
The real goal here is to find a widely available (and cheap) board that can be used as an example. I will have to take another look around.<br>

You could use the raspi, but they seem to (ab)use the FIQ for their USB host driver.<br>
<p>
Another alternative would be one of the dozens of i.MX6 boards. Freescale doesn't lock you out of secure mode, so you can use FIQs.<br>

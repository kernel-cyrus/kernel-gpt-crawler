<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 20, 2011</br>
           </div>
Control groups remain a controversial topic in kernel circles; some
developers like them, others hate them.  The latter group would like to see
the feature removed altogether, but that seems unlikely to happen; there
are too many users for control groups already, with more to come.  The 2011
Linux Plumbers Conference featured a discussion among those users that gave
some insights into why control groups are useful and what could be done to
make them more so.
<p>
The session started with a brief talk by Kir Kolyshkin of Parallels; for
him, control groups are all about implementing containers.  Containers can
be seen as a sort of poor user's virtualization; it enables the running of
multiple, isolated user-space systems all on the same kernel.  Containers
tend to be more efficient than pure virtualization; they are also, he said,
the only form of virtualization available for the ARM architecture at the
moment.  Control groups help in the implementation of containers by
isolating groups of processes from each other and by allowing the
imposition of resource limits on each group.
<p>
The bulk of the session, though, centered around a presentation by 
Tim Hockin on Google's isolation and resource limitation needs.  Google's
cluster runs all kinds of jobs which, internally, are divided into
"tier&nbsp;1" and "tier&nbsp;2" tasks.  The general problem Google has is
that tasks normally do not use 100% of the resources they request; that

<a href="/Articles/459606/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2011/lpc/TimHockin-sm.jpg" width=125 height=142 alt="[Tim
Hockin]" border=0 align="right" hspace=3></a>

means that systems in the cluster tend to be underutilized.  Google would
like to be able to pack more jobs onto each box, but they have to be very
careful about overcommitting resources.  If that is not done carefully,
resource-intensive jobs can get in the way of urgent tasks like responding
to search queries.
<p>
Google uses its own form of containers to be able to overcommit systems
safely.  Containers let Google place limits on the CPU usage, memory usage,
I/O bandwidth consumption, etc. of each group of processes on the system.
The goal, when all goes well, is to isolate each group from the others,
provide predictable resources to each, and to lose very little time on the
container implementation itself.  Control groups are used when they are
available and suitable to the task; in other places, a lot of user-space
control code is used instead.  The user-space code is complex and racy, Tim
said; they would like to be rid of it.
<p>
There is a special daemon running on each system that wakes up about every
100ms to have a look at what is going on.  Should it detect a load spike
originating from the system's tier-1 work, it will stop or kill any tier-2
tasks needed to make room.  This all works, but it could work better; more
support from the kernel would be helpful.
<p>
For example, memory use needs to be tightly controlled on these systems.
At the moment, Google is using the "fake NUMA" feature to partition system
memory and parcel it out as needed (see <a href="/Articles/436871/">this
article</a> for a bit more information on how that works).  Fake NUMA is a
hack, though, with resource costs of its own.  They are moving to the kernel's
memory controller, but it is not yet suitable for their needs because it
cannot work with nested control groups.  They had similar problems with the
disk bandwidth controller, but that problem <a href="/Articles/427961/">has
been resolved</a> recently.  In general, Tim said, anybody who is designing
a controller for Linux should think about how it will nest from the
beginning. 
<p>
One other problem with the memory controller is its handling of shared
memory.  Currently shared pages are billed to the control group that
touches it first.  That makes deterministic resource control hard,
especially in situations where the limits are set tightly.  Tim didn't like
the idea of proportional billing (dividing the charge for each page across
each group that has it mapped) any better.  That, he said, takes memory
billing out of the control of each group; if one control group exits, the
others will suddenly find themselves over their limits as their portion of
the shared pages grows.  What he would like would be the ability to manually
arrange for pages backed by certain files to be billed to specific groups.
Then he could set up a system group to be billed for, say, the C library.
<p>
There are some other problems as well.  The memory overhead of the memory
controller is painfully high, for example.  Google would really like a way
to query the size of the working set for each control group, but that
capability is not currently there.  They also really want per-control-group
reclaim to focus the memory management code on the control groups that are
currently exceeding their limits.  And, if a container goes so far over its
limits that the out-of-memory killer gets involved, it would be really nice
to have a way to kill a whole control group at once instead of having to do
it one process at a time.  (It's worth noting that patches for many
of these features exist; many of them come from Google).
<p>
Beyond that, there is a lot of interest in the I/O bandwidth controller.  A
lot of Google jobs, he said, are "seek locked"; controlling how much I/O
bandwidth they use is important.  Controllers for other types of resources
(number of threads, number of open file descriptors, network ports, etc.)
would be useful.  And so on.
<p>
The session spent some time on other topics - primarily <a
href="/Articles/452184/">user-space checkpoint/restart</a>.  It was agreed
that everybody in the room was interested in better isolation, and that the
memory controller was the area in need of the most work at the moment.
The session was dominated by users of control groups, though; there were
not a lot of implementers present.  Even more notable in their absence were
those developers who are opposed to control groups in their current form;
it would have been interesting to hear their ideas about how the needs
expressed there should really be met.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Seriously - has he tried using google?  A quick google for "ARM virtualization" shows several virtualization solutions available from Open Kernel Labs, VirtualLogix, and Xen! All on the first page of hits.<br>

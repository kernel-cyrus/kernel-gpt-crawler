<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 23, 2014</br>
           </div>
Regular LWN readers will be, by now, well aware of the fact that the
kernel's Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) virtual machine is in the middle of a
rapid development phase, moving beyond packet filtering into a number of
other roles.  "<a href="/Articles/603983/">Extending extended BPF</a>,"
published at the beginning of July, covered many of the changes that are in
the works for an upcoming kernel release.  The patch set covered there has
evolved considerably since the article was written; the basic functionality
is the same, but the API is not.  So another look seems warranted.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/605907/">version 2 patch set</a> posted by Alexei
Starovoitov retains many of the features of the first version.  It still
adds a single <tt>bpf()</tt> system call providing a number of new
functions.  Among those are the ability to load BPF programs, of course,
though there is still no way to directly run these programs from user
space.  In the old patch set, though, BPF programs were represented by
numeric IDs in a global namespace.  That feature is now gone.  Instead, the
new interface to load a program looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    int bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD, enum bpf_prog_type prog_type, struct nlattr *attr,
            int attr_len);
</pre>
<p>
As before, there is only one "program type" defined:
<tt>BPF_PROG_TYPE_UNSPEC</tt>, and the actual program is to be found in the
<tt>attr</tt> array.  That array, as before, must also contain an attribute
describing the license that applies to the loaded program.  Unlike the
previous version, version&nbsp;2 does not prohibit the loading of
non-GPL-compatible programs.  It does, however, allow functions "exported"
to BPF programs from the kernel to be marked GPL-only; non-GPL-compatible
programs that attempt to call such a function will fail to load.
<p>
The <tt>attr</tt> array can also contain a special "fixup" section; this
feature will be discussed momentarily.
<p>
What's missing from the above call, relative to the first version, is the
<tt>prog_id</tt> parameter specifying the global ID number to use.
There is no longer any need for an application to specify such an ID;
instead, the kernel tracks programs internally and, whenever a program is
loaded, an associated file descriptor is allocated and returned to user
space.  The application can then use that descriptor to refer to the loaded
BPF program, which will remain in the kernel for as long as
the file descriptor is held open.  There is, thus, no longer any need for
an explicit "unload program" operation; instead, the application need only
close the file descriptor.
<p>
The "maps" feature from version 1 has also been retained, but, again, the
global ID numbers are gone.  When a map is created (using the
<tt>BPF_MAP_CREATE</tt> command to the <tt>bpf()</tt> system call), a file
descriptor is once again returned to the calling process.   That descriptor
can be used to store values in the map, query values, iterate through the
map, and so on.  Once again, the map will continue to exist for as long as
the file descriptor remains open.
<p>
The removal of the global program and map ID namespaces eliminates a whole
set of potential 
problems, including excessive resource usage if programs leave loaded BPF
resources lying around after they exit and possible ID number conflicts.
In the end, global IDs are reminiscent of the System V IPC API, and that is
not something that everybody wants to be reminded of.  But it does raise an
interesting question: how do loaded BPF programs refer to maps?
<p>
In the previous version of the patch set, using a map to communicate
between a BPF program and user space was straightforward; the two sides
just had to agree on the proper ID number(s).  In the absence of a global
ID, an application can refer to a BPF map using the file descriptor passed
back from the kernel.  But file descriptors only have a meaning in the
context of a specific process, and BPF programs do not run in any sort of
process context.  So the file descriptor cannot be used on the BPF side.
<p>
Alexei's solution is to add a "fixup array" to the process of loading a BPF
program.  This array contains one or more instances of this structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct bpf_map_fixup {
	int insn_idx;
	int fd;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The array is passed to the <tt>BPF_PROG_LOAD</tt> operation in the
<tt>attr</tt> argument.  As part of the loading process, the kernel will
iterate through the array.  For each entry, <tt>insn_idx</tt> is expected
to be the offset within the program of a function call instruction that
makes use of a BPF map; the actual map to be passed to that function is
represented by <tt>fd</tt>.  The program loader will convert <tt>fd</tt>
into an internal representation that is available to BPF programs, then
modify the indicated instruction accordingly.  In this way, the
process-specific file descriptor numbers are removed from the program,
replaced by internal IDs.
<p>
This solution may strike some readers as being a bit inelegant.  For the
most part, the BPF virtual machine knows nothing about maps; they are
implemented using the "external function" mechanism.  Indeed, for the map
functionality to be available in any specific context (when running socket
filter programs, for example), the kernel code setting up that context must
include a fair amount of boilerplate code exporting the map functions to
BPF programs.  This design allows maps to be implemented with no direct
support from the virtual machine; there are no map-specific BPF
instructions, for example.
<p>
The addition of the fixup array wrecks that separation, pushing an
awareness of maps (and how they are represented) into the core of the BPF
program loader.  This solution works, but one can't help but wonder if it
might not be better just to implement map operations directly as BPF
instructions.  Then the program loader could recognize those instructions
and replace the file-descriptor numbers automatically; user-space programs
would not have to track the index of every operation that uses maps and set
up a proper fixup array operation.
<p>
As of this writing, though, nobody else has raised such an objection;
commentary on this version of the patch set has been quiet in general.
That silence suggests that, as a whole, reviewers are relatively happy with
what is 
there.  Unless something changes in the near future, it seems likely that a
version of this patch set will be put forward for the 3.17 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

That "fixup" mechanism seems vaguely reminiscent of something that "binder" does.<br>
binder doesn't use fds, but it has similar numeric handles not unlike the "watch descriptors" that inotify uses.<br>
<p>
A "binder_buffer" (which holds a message) contains some data and then some "offsets".<br>
The "offsets" are references into the data part of the buffer where "flat_binder_object"s are stored, which contain a type, some flags and an object identifier.<br>
Based on the the type, some transformation is performed on the object identifier to convert between "remote" and "local" references. (see switch (fp-&gt;type) in binder_transaction()).<br>
<p>
This is much the same as converting between kernel-internal pointers and user-space fd numbers.<br>

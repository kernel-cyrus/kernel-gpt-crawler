<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 25, 2022</br>
           </div>
The kernel <a href="/Articles/666509/">gained support for the TLS
protocol</a> in the 4.13 release, which came out in September 2017.  That
support is incomplete, though, in that it does not provide the kernel with
a way to initiate a TLS connection on its own.  Instead, user space creates
a socket and performs the TLS handshake before handing the socket to the
kernel, which can then transfer data using TLS.  The situation may be about
to change as a result of <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/165030059051.5073.16723746870370826608.stgit@oracle-102.nfsv4.dev/">this
patch series</a> from Chuck Lever — though user space will still need to
remain in the picture.
<p>
TLS, of course, allows for the transfer of encrypted data over the
network; it is the protocol that lurks behind HTTPS links, among other
things.  At this point, a significant fraction of the data transferred over
the net is encrypted in this fashion.  Once a connection has been
established, encrypting data to send to the other end is relatively
straightforward, as is decrypting received data.  Establishing the
connection, though, is a more complex affair, involving, among other
things, algorithm negotiation and the provision and verification of public
keys for one or both ends.
<p>
There are a few advantages to supporting TLS in the kernel, including a
small performance boost and the ability to apply <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/filter.html">socket
filters</a>.  TLS 
session establishment, though, is less performance-critical and, due to its
complexity, potentially a bigger source of bugs and security problems.  So,
when TLS support was added to the kernel, it focused on the
data-transmission problem, leaving the difficulties of session setup to
user space.  That is how kernel TLS support has worked in the intervening
years.
<p>
This solution works, but there are times when it could be useful for the kernel
to have the ability to initiate TLS sessions on it own; thus Lever's patch.
That said, this patch set still does not bring the TLS handshake into the
kernel, even though that is the desired goal eventually:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	In the long run, our preference is to have a TLS handshake
	implementation in the kernel. However, it appears that would take a
	long time and there is some desire to avoid adding to the Linux
	kernel's "attack surface" without good reasons. So in the meantime
	we've created a prototype handshake implementation that calls out
	to user space where the actual handshake can be done by an existing
	library implementation of TLS.
</blockquote>
<p>
This design requires that a special user-space process be running in any
context (specifically, any network namespace) where there may be a need for
the kernel to initiate TLS connections.  That process will create a 
socket using the new <tt>AF_TLSH</tt> ("TLS helper") address-family type,
then listen on that socket.  When the kernel needs to have a TLS session
established, the <tt>listen()</tt> call will return with a connected TCP
socket; the process can then talk with the remote peer to get the session
established.  If that negotiation is successful, a <tt>setsockopt()</tt>
call with the new <tt>SOL_TLS</tt> option can be used to describe the newly
established session.  Closing the socket will then return it to the kernel.
<p>
On the kernel side, instead, there is a new function to be called after the
initial TCP connection has been made:
<p>
<pre>
    int tls_client_hello_x509(struct socket *sock, void (*done)(void *data, int status),
			      void *data, const char *priorities, key_serial_t peerid,
			      key_serial_t cert);
</pre>
<p>
This call will attempt to pass <tt>sock</tt> to the helper process; if that
works, it will return zero; the negotiation will still be ongoing at that
time.  Once session setup succeeds (or fails), the
<tt>done()</tt> callback will be called with the result of the operation;
if a successful status is reported there, the kernel should be able to
communicate over the socket using TLS.
There is also <tt>tls_client_hello_psk()</tt>, which can be shared in
situations where a pre-shared key exists.
<p>
Why, one might ask, is this capability needed?  One answer comes in the
form of <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/165030062272.5246.16956092606399079004.stgit@oracle-102.nfsv4.dev/">a
followup patch set</a> implementing <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-nfsv4-rpc-tls/">the
remote procedure call (RPC) protocol over TLS</a>.  That, in turn, can be
used to implement the NFS filesystem protocol over encrypted
connections. In the future, Lever said, there may also be interest in using
this feature to support the SMB filesystem protocol over <a
href="/Articles/745590/">QUIC</a> connections, 
assuming, of course, that the kernel actually gets QUIC support one of
these years.
<p>
The reaction to the TLS patches has been relatively muted, consisting
solely of a set of Reviewed-by tags from Hannes Reinecke, who was also the
author of one of the patches.  The RPC-over-TLS patches, instead, have run
into some <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/962bbdf09f6f446f26ea9b418ddfec60a23aed8d.camel@hammerspace.com/">disagreement</a>
from Trond Myklebust, the maintainer of the kernel's NFS client.  He argued
that the setup work could be done entirely in user space by the
<tt>mount.nfs</tt> utility.  Lever <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/06AB6768-AA74-43AF-9B9A-D6580EA0AE86@oracle.com/">responded</a>
that there are situations where, it is felt, the kernel needs to make the
decision on whether TLS should be used.  The conversation wound down
without arriving at a conclusion, so chances are good that this is a topic
that will come up at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">Linux Storage, Filesystem,
and Memory-Management Summit</a> in early May.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The biggest kTLS win is really that you can use sendfile() on TLS sockets. That&#x27;s not only a performance boost from fewer syscalls, it allows the kernel to manage the buffers much nicer.<br>

I really wish we still had the option to use strong-HMAC+null-cipher setups on the open internet, for sendfile() and other efficiency reasons. An outsourced CDN serving up common JS/CSS libraries, for example, doesn&#x27;t really benefit from anything beyond a tamper-proof signature on the contents.<br>

One could argue HTTP headers are sensitive but I&#x27;d contend they should stop stuffing all that personally-identifying data in them in the first place; you only *need* the GET line.<br>

You can infer all that with just the tuple of (client-addr, server-addr-that-maps-to-known-cdn, response-size-of-known-js-file). This was e.g. why Debian was resistant to slapping HTTPS security theatre on its mirror network when it already has GPG signatures.<br>

I just noticed some guy&#x27;s BPF/eBPF joke lasts more than a year. Come on! This is totally irrelevant. <br>
<p>
TLS in kernel itself is a very useful feature, which makes passing TLS connection between processes possible: <br>

To be fair, you can move TLS connections between userspace processes without kTLS, as long as the library allows serializing its contents (like TLSe can).<br>

<p>
Yes. However, it&#x27;s almost impossible in production to switch to any other TLS implementation from major implementations like OpenSSL.<br>
kTLS in theory makes adding such support to OpenSSL easier, since the kernel takes charge of most of the TLS context.<br>

Moving complicated, security-sensitive kernel functionality out into a userspace helper makes a lot of sense.<br>

Why haven&#x27;t we moved the NFS client out of the kernel into userspace?<br>

There are userland NFS clients that use FUSE, but they are quite slow. Shlepping data back and forth across the kernel/userland barrier is not particularly good for performance. There&#x27;s also the problem of having to deal with upcall/downcall issues -- unresponsive userland processes, big problems when memory gets low etc...<br>
<p>
FWIW, the old smbfs filesystem used to establish sockets in userland and hand them off to the kernel, much like the TLS implementation described here. Hopefully the TLS patches will be significantly more robust...<br>

There is also libnfs¹ which allows any application to access NFS shares (without needing FUSE or other kernel support). This is used by Gvfs &amp; Kodi for example.<br>

I wonder how possible it would be to have something that&#x27;s like a kernel thread but runs in user mode with an address space. I think there are a bunch of aspects of user space helpers that are unnecessarily annoying (like having to find the code via a filesystem, for something that only the kernel needs to run) and potential benefits that aren&#x27;t too expensive otherwise (like having the protocol implementation not in an address space with key material or user data).<br>

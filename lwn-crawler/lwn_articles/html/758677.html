<h1>The final step for huge-page swapping</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 2, 2018</br>
           </div>
For many years, Linux system administrators have gone out of their way to
avoid swapping.  The advent of nonvolatile memory is changing the equation,
though, and swapping is starting to look interesting again — if it can
perform well enough.  That is not the case in current kernels, but a
longstanding project to allow the swapping of transparent huge pages
promises to improve that situation considerably.  That work is reaching its
final stage and might just enter the mainline soon.
<p>
The use of huge pages can improve the performance of the system
significantly, so the kernel works hard to make them available.  The
transparent huge pages mechanism collects application data into huge pages
behind the scenes, and the memory-management subsystem as a whole works
hard to ensure that appropriately sized pages are available.  When it comes
time to swap out a process's pages, though, all of that work is discarded,
and a huge page is split back into hundreds of normal pages to be written
out.  When swapping was slow and generally avoided, that didn't matter much,
but it is a bigger problem if one wants to swap to a fast device and
maintain performance.
<p>
The work so far, which has been underway since 2016, has focused on keeping
huge pages together for as long as possible in the swapout process.  Before
this work began, the splitting of huge pages was one of the first things
that was done in the swap-out process.  The <a
href="/Articles/702159/">first step</a> (merged in 4.13) was 
to delay 
splitting huge pages until after the swap entries had been allocated.  That
work alone improved performance considerably, mostly by reducing the number
of times the associated locks had to be acquired and released.  <a
href="/Articles/728627/">Step two</a>, merged in 4.14, further delayed the
splitting until the huge page had actually been written to the swap device,
again improving performance through better batching and by writing the
entire huge page as a unit.  Progress slowed down
for a while after those pieces went upstream.
<p>
Things have picked up again with <a href="/Articles/758107/">the final
installment</a> of 21 patches, posted by Ying Huang.  Swapping out an
entire huge page as a unit has 
already been mostly solved by the previous work, so it requires little
effort here.  What is a bit trickier, though, is keeping track of swapped
huge pages.  A whole set of swap entries is required to track both the huge
page and its component pages, and they must all be kept in sync.  Any event
that might result in the splitting of a resident huge page, such as
unmapping part of the page, an <tt>madvise()</tt> call, etc., must be
caught so that the corresponding swap entries can be updated accordingly.
Memory-use accounting for control groups must be updated to take huge-page
swapping into account.
The bulk of the patch set is dedicated to taking care of this kind of
bookkeeping.

<p>
Once this work is done, the other side of the problem is relatively easy to
solve.  The page-fault handler can recognize a fault in a
swapped huge page and try to swap the entire huge page back in as a unit.  Such
attempts can always fail if a free huge page is not available, of course, in
which case the page will be split before being swapped back in.  When it
works, the operation will again 
benefit from the batching involved; the total overhead of bringing the
entire huge page back into memory will be significantly reduced.
<p>
It turns out, though, that this may not be the biggest performance benefit
from this work.  As noted above, the kernel works hard to maximize the use
of huge pages in the current workload; that includes coalescing individual
pages into huge pages whenever possible.  The current swap system undoes
that work; if a huge page is swapped out, it will be swapped back in as
individual pages.  At that point, the kernel will have to restart the process
of joining them into a huge page from the beginning.  That is a fair amount
of extra work for the kernel to do.  More to the point, though, there is a
limit to the rate at which pages can be coalesced in this way, and the
operation may not always succeed.  So, often, those small pages will remain
separate and system performance will suffer accordingly.
<p>
If, instead, huge pages are swapped back in as huge pages, that work need
not be done and the total number of huge pages in the running workload can
be expected to increase significantly.  Actually, "significantly"
understates the impact of this work.  In
benchmark results posted with the patch, Huang notes that a system with an
unmodified kernel ran the test with only 4.5% of the anonymous data being
kept in huge pages by the end;  with the patch set applied, that number rose to
96.6%.  Inter-processor interrupts fell by 96%, and spinlock wait time
dropped from 13.9% to 0.1%.  The I/O throughput of swapping itself
increased over 1000%.  Kernel developers will often work long and hard for a
1% performance increase; improvements on this scale are nearly unheard of.
<p>
Given that, one might conclude that merging this patch set would be
worthwhile.  But getting memory-management changes merged is always hard,
especially when the patch set is large, as this one is.  As Andrew Morton
<a href="/Articles/758700/">remarked</a>: "<q>It's a tremendously good
performance improvement.  It's also a tremendously large patchset</q>".
Morton plans to put it into the -mm tree as soon as some conflicts with the
<a href="/Articles/757342/">XArray patches</a> can be worked out.  But what is
really needed is some extensive review by other memory-management
developers.  Until that happens, the world will be stuck with slow
huge-page swapping.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

We have huge page cache support, technically.  tmpfs works, for instance.  What we don't have is support for real filesystems (ext4, xfs, etc...).  Kirill Shutemov had some patches for that, two or so years ago that need to get dusted off and pushed again.<br>

      I would expect significant performance advantages from huge-page swapping on HDDs.  With sequential bandwidths of ~200MB/s on fast HDDs, a 2MB page can be transferred in 10ms.  The random access latency on a HDD is also about 10ms.  So a randomly located 2MB page can be swapped in or out in about the same time as two 4KB pages that are randomly located.

I'd say gradually, but probably a noticeable change was commit e4a49efe4e7e ("mm: thp: set THP defrag by default to madvise and add a stall-free defrag option") in 4.6. Since then page faults do not try to allocate THP's aggressively.<br>

<h1>Module unloading in a reference counted world</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 27, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Increasingly, the kernel uses reference counts to know when data structures
are no longer needed and can be reclaimed.  This reference counting tends
to be managed by the <a href="/Articles/51437/">kobject</a> type, though
other mechanisms are used as well.  When properly used, this mechanism
works well.

Interesting issues can come up, however, when reference-counted objects are
maintained by code in loadable modules.  In many situations, the module
cannot be unloaded until all objects it has created have seen their
reference counts go to zero and have been returned to the system.
Otherwise, the system can be left with objects containing invalid references
to module code which no longer exists.  Bad things usually result from that
situation.
<p>
Alan Stern recently ran into this sort of situation; his module registers
various structures with the device model, and must be sure not to allow
itself to be unloaded until those structures have been released.  To that
end, he wrote <a href="/Articles/68153/">a patch</a> adding two functions
(<tt>class_device_unregister_wait()</tt> and
<tt>platform_device_unregister_wait()</tt>) which unregister those
structures and explicitly wait until they have been released.  This patch
did not get very far, however; it was quickly pointed out that, with this
code, it is relatively easy to deadlock the kernel.  If the process trying
to remove the module also has an open file descriptor to one of that
module's sysfs entries, everything comes to a halt.  The suggested solution,
instead, is to simply not allow the module to be unloaded if it still has
unreclaimed objects outstanding.
<p>
That approach is taken in some other contexts.  The <tt>cdev</tt> structure
used to represent char devices uses a kobject for its reference count.  The
<tt>cdev_get()</tt> function does more than just increment the count in the
kobject, however; it also increments the reference count for the module
which drives that device.  If any <tt>cdev</tt> structure owned by a module
has references, the module, too, will have a non-zero reference count and
will not be unloadable.
<p>
Another approach has been taken in the network subsystem.  The
<tt>net_device</tt> structure represents a network device; its rules say
that it must be allocated dynamically, with <tt>alloc_netdev()</tt>.  When
the network driver is done with the structure, it calls
<tt>free_netdev()</tt> to get rid of it.  The <tt>net_device</tt> structure
has its own reference count, but it is not tied to the underlying module's
reference count.  Instead, the networking system guarantees that, once
<tt>free_netdev()</tt> has been called, it will not call into the module
again for that device.  The release function for the <tt>net_device</tt>
structure, which returns its memory to the system, lives in the networking
code, rather than in any loadable module.  As a result, the module can be
removed even while some of its <tt>net_device</tt> structures continue to
exist, and all will be well.  Those structures have been detached from the
module which created them, and will be freed by core kernel code.
<p>
The real lesson from all this, perhaps, is that the kernel developers are
still figuring out the implications of the lifetime rules of the objects
they create.  The addition of sysfs in 2.5 has tended to force this issue;
sysfs exposes a great many internal kernel objects to user space, which can
keep references to those objects for an indeterminate period of time.
Making everything work safely in this environment has proved to be a
challenge at times.
<p>
And module unloading, of course, will always be a challenge.  There will
likely always be issues involved with removing code from a live kernel.  <a

<div class="BigQuote">
	The proper thing to do (and what we _have_ done) is to say
	"unloading of modules is not supported". It's a debugging feature,
	and you literally shouldn't do it unless you are actively
	developing that module.
</div>
<p>
Experience shows that many users are not happy with a kernel which cannot
unload modules, however.  So the kernel developers are likely to be
wrestling with these issues for some time yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Refcounting?  Come on.  Why not a kernel-level garbage collector?  Besides being better from a performance standpoint (refcounts are expensive to update all the time), this would also help resolve a lot of these circularity problems.  And it'd make the Lispers happy, too.  :-)<br>

      Of course, there *is* a kernel-level garbage collector, but it's for AF_UNIX sockets. :)

      Yes, just what I was going to post :-)<p>All of these problems that the kernel developers keep reporting were solved back in the 60s and 70s by garbage collectors which are *more efficient* than hand allocation.<p>Rich.

      Any garbage collecting scheme has to be implementable on all architectures (like ref counting is), not too punishing on the cache (like ref counting is), and fairly small and simple (like ref counting).<p>Despite its disadvantages, ref counting still has (and will perhaps always have) its place.  In particular, the number of counts for modules is probably quite low, and fairly static, so that inc/decref performance issues aren't much concern (but cache issues are).  Circular dependencies may be the bigger problem, but even then, in the limited domain of kernel modules, one that might be addressed in a straightforward way.<p>However, I welcome comments about what specific advantages other garbage collecting schemes might offer.<br>

      <p>As I have already told Linus in person on at least two occasions, there are unfortunately several other important reasons to unload modules, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>To reinitialise hardware without rebooting (rescanning SCSI busses!)</li>
<li>Hot-pluggable hardware (including PCMCIA and USB), especially on laptops that are suspended rather than being rebooted and that sometimes use a vast number of different hot-pluggable devices between reboots</li>
<li>Rarely used filesystems on removable media (e.g. accessing an HFS CD-ROM)</li>
</ul>

      <p>I did not understand your arguments. Modules can be shutdown/reinitialized without unloading. So, let's see:</p><p>
<ul>
<li><i>To reinitialise hardware without rebooting</i>... shutdown module, reinitialize module, no need to unload.
<li><i>Hot-pluggable hardware (including PCMCIA and USB), especially on laptops that are suspended rather than being rebooted and that sometimes use a vast number of different hot-pluggable devices between reboots</i>... vast number? let's see... I have two different 802.11b usb adapters + mp3 player + camera + webcam + mouse + keyboard + palmtop + flash disk + smart media reader. All of them take, like, 100KiB of the kernel memory? the hotplug routine is (at boot): verify all hotplugable stuff if they are still there, if not send hotplug-unplug event to the driver, it sits there until you want to plug the thing on again.
<li><i>Rarely used filesystems on removable media (e.g. accessing an HFS CD-ROM)</i>... why not just leave it there?
</ul>
<p>Ok, before you start hating me, I will give the only real good argumento pro-module-unloading: so you can upgrade a buggy or insecure module without (possibly expensive in terms of time) rebooting the machine.</p>

      I guess it depends upon what you mean by shutdown.<p>However, the examples given are just cases where traditional modules do something only at load time, so the only way to do it over is to unload and load again.  But there's no reason those modules couldn't do the same thing (tearing down, rebuilding) while loaded and running.<br>

      People are never going to accept a world where module loading is one way, and it has nothing to do with practical arguments.  It's simply unclean.<p>Linus is usually pretty sensitive to the difference between clean designs and unclean ones; I'm surprised he favors one-way module loading.<br>

      --I'll give you an AMEN, and a real-world example: Knoppix live-cd's.<p>--Live-cds can load a bunch of things by default (like NTFS module) that I simply **do not have** on my system.  The module is sitting there taking up memory, and with 2.4 and ALL PREVIOUS kernels -- all the way back to 2.0 -- I can unload the module if it's not needed.<p>--To do away with that functionality leads to madness and despair, and (l)user revolt. ;-)<br>

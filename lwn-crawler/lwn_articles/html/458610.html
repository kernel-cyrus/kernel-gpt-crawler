           </div>
Almost every service offered by Google is delivered over the Internet, so
it makes sense that the company would have an interest in improving how the
net performs.  The networking session at the 2011 Linux Plumbers Conference
featured presentations from three Google developers, each of whom had a
proposal for a significant implementation change.  Between the three, it
seems, there is still a lot of room for improvement in how we do
networking. 

<p>
<h4>Proportional rate reduction</h4>
<p>
The "congestion window" is a TCP sender's idea of how much data it can have
in flight to the other end before it starts to overload a link in the middle.
Dropped packets are often a sign that the congestion window is too large,
so TCP implementations normally reduce the window significantly when loss
happens.  Cutting the congestion window will reduce performance, though; if
the packet loss was a one-time event, that slowdown will be entirely
unnecessary.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3517">RFC 3517</a>
describes an algorithm for bringing the connection up to speed quickly
after a lost packet, but, Nandita Dukkipati says, we can do better.
<p>
According to Nandita, a large portion of the network sessions involving
Google's servers
experience losses at some point; the ones that do can take 7-10 times
longer to complete.  RFC 3517 is part of the problem.  This algorithm
responds to a packet loss by immediately cutting the congestion window in
half; that means that the sending system must, if the congestion window had
been full at the time of the loss, wait for ACKs for half of the in-transit
packets before transmitting again.  That causes the sender to go silent for
an extended period of time.  It works well enough in simple cases (a single
packet lost in a long-lasting flow), but it tends to clog up the works when
dealing with short flows or extended packet losses.

</blockquote>
<p>
Linux does not use strict RFC 3517 now; it uses, instead, an enhancement
called "rate halving."  With this algorithm, the congestion window is not
halved immediately.  Once the connection goes into loss recovery, each
incoming ACK (which will typically acknowledge the receipt of two packets
at the other end) will cause the congestion window to be reduced by a
single packet.  Over the course of one full set of in-flight packets, the
window will be cut in half, but the sending system will continue to
transmit (at a lower rate) while that reduction is happening.  The result
is a smoother flow and reduced latency.
<p>
But rate halving can be improved upon.  The ACKs it depends on are
themselves subject to loss; an extended loss can cause significant
reduction of the congestion window and slow recovery.  This algorithm also
does not even begin the process of raising the congestion window back to
the highest workable value until the recovery process is complete.  So it
can take quite a while to get back up to full speed.
<p>
The proportional rate reduction algorithm takes a different approach.  The
first step is to calculate an estimate for the amount of data still in
flight, followed by a calculation of what, according to the congestion
control algorithm in use, the  congestion window should now be.  If the
amount of data in the pipeline is less than the target congestion window,
the system just goes directly into the TCP slow start algorithm to bring
the congestion window back up.  Thus, when the connection experiences a
burst of losses, it will start trying to rebuild the congestion window
right away instead of creeping along with a small window for an extended
period.
<p>

If, instead, the amount of data in flight is at least as large as the new
congestion window, an algorithm
similar to rate halving is used.  The actual reduction is calculated
relative to the new congestion window, though, rather than being a strict
one-half cut.  For both large and small losses, the emphasis on using
estimates of the 
amount of in-flight data instead of counting ACKs is said to make recovery
go more smoothly and to avoid needless reductions in the congestion window.
<p>
How much more better is it?  Nandita said that Google has been running
experiments on some of its systems; the result has been a 3-10% reduction
in average latency.  Recovery timeouts have been reduced by&nbsp;5%.  This
code is being deployed more widely on Google's servers; it also has been
accepted for merging during the 3.2 development cycle.  More information
can be found in <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mathis-tcpm-proportional-rate-reduction-01">this
draft RFC</a>.

<p>
<h4>TCP fast open</h4>
<p>
Opening a TCP connection requires a three-packet handshake: a SYN packet
sent by the client, a SYN-ACK response from the server, and a final ACK
from the client.  Until the handshake is complete, the link can carry no
data, so the handshake imposes an unavoidable startup latency on every
connection.  But what would happen, asked Yuchung Cheng, if one were to
send data with the handshake packets?  For simple transactions - an HTTP
GET request followed by the contents of a web page, for example - sending
the relevant data with the handshake packets would eliminate that latency.
The result of this thought is the "TCP fast open" proposal.
<p>
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">RFC 793</a> (describing TCP)
does allow data to be passed with the handshake packets, with the proviso
that the data not be passed to applications until the handshake completes.
One can consider fudging that last requirement to speed the process of
transmitting data through a TCP connection, but there are some hazards to
be dealt with.  An obvious problem is the amplification of SYN flood
attacks, which are bad enough when they only involve the kernel; if each
received SYN packet were to take up application resources as well, the
denial of service possibilities would be significantly worse.
<p>
Yuchung described an approach to fast open which is intended to get
around most of the problems.  The first step is the creation of a
per-server secret which is hashed with information from each client to
create a per-client cookie.  That cookie is sent to the client as a special
option on an ordinary SYN-ACK packet; the client can keep it and use it for
fast opens in the future.  The requirement to get a cookie first is a low
bar for the prevention of SYN flood attacks, but it does make things a
little harder.  In addition, the server's secret is changed relatively
often, and, 
if the server starts to see too many connections, fast open will simply be
disabled until things calm down.
<p>
One remaining problem is that about 5% of the systems on the net will drop
SYN packets containing unknown options or data.  There is little to be done
in this situation; TCP fast open simply will not work.  The client must
thus remember cases where the fast-open SYN packet did not get through and
just use ordinary opens in the future.
<p>
Fast open will not happen by default; applications on both ends of the
connection must specifically request it.  On the client side, the
<tt>sendto()</tt> system call is used to request a fast-open connection;
with the new <tt>MSG_FAST_OPEN</tt> flag, it functions like the combination
of <tt>connect()</tt> and <tt>sendmsg()</tt>.  On the server side, a
<tt>setsockopt()</tt> call with the <tt>TCP_FAST_OPEN</tt> option will
enable fast opens.  Either way, applications need not worry about dealing
with the fast-open cookies and such.
<p>
In Google's testing, TCP fast open has been seen to improve page load times
by anything between 4% and 40%.  This technique works best in situations
where the round trip time is high, naturally; the bigger the latency, the
more value there is in removing it.  A patch implementing this feature will
be submitted for inclusion sometime soon.
<p>
<h4>Briefly: user-space network queues</h4>
<p>
While the previous two talks were concerned with improving the efficiency
of data transfer over the net, Willem de Bruijn is concerned with network
processing on the local host.  In particular, he is working with high-end
hardware: high-speed links, numerous processors, and, importantly, smart
network adapters that can recognize specific flows and direct packets to
connection-specific queues.  By the time the kernel gets around to thinking
about a given packet at all, it will already be sorted into the proper
place, waiting for the application to ask for the data.
<p>
Actual processing of the packets will happen in the context of the
receiving process as needed.  So it all happens in the right context and on
the right CPU; intermediate processing at the software IRQ level will be
avoided.  Willem even described a new interface whereby the application
would receive packets directly from the kernel via a shared memory
segment.
<p>
In other words, this talk described a variant of the network channels
concept, where packet processing is pushed as close to the application as
possible.  There are numerous details to be dealt with, including the usual
hangups for the channels idea: firewall processing and such.  The proposed
use of a file in sysfs to pass packets to user space also seems unlikely to
pass review.  But this work may eventually reach a point where it is
generally useful; those who are interested can find the patches on <a

I am a networking ignoramus, so please excuse the following if necessary.  I thought though that firewalling normally involves taking a decision about whether to allow or forbid a particular connection as a whole.  Can't the packet sequence for a particular connection simply be assigned to a particular user-space buffer after (if) that connection has been allowed?<br>

      <p>The idea behind network channels is to push (packet) processing out of the kernel towards the application. Over simplified: a direct pipe between incoming packets at the hardware level and the application. Packet processing won't be done by the kernel (again, oversimplified), hence no firewall checks.<br/>
Firewalls would have to be implemented in user space, in e.g. a library, every application connecting tot a network channel would need to link to that library and explicitly do it's own firewalling.</p>

<p>
I agree, that sort of firewall cannot be implemented by just allowing or disallowing connections when they are first made.  If you don't want an additional data copy it might work if the card is writing to a shared memory buffer which is only made available to the application once the firewall has given the green light.  That would slow things down quite a bit, but I think if you want to inspect data that closely you have to live with that anyway (or use an external firewall).  Having the receiver process itself doing the inspection as suggested by appie above [1] is probably not really an option here, as this sort of firewall is most likely there to stop the user doing things they may want to do but you (for some value of you) don't.<br>

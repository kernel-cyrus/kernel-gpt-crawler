<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2015/">2015 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
Greg Kroah-Hartman started off a 2015 Kernel Summit session on developer
recruitment by noting that the kernel's rate of change hasn't increased
much recently.  We might have hit a plateau, he said, but still nobody else can
possibly keep up with us; "we won."  The only thing that can stop us
now is ourselves.  To avoid that, we need to keep bringing in lots of new
developers.  That, in turn, means that we need to be nice to our developers.
The future of the project, he said, depends on them.
<p>
He took a minute to talk about the widespread hostility toward cleanup
patches.  The best way to avoid getting such patches, he suggested, was for
maintainers to just clean up the code themselves; it shouldn't take that
much time for them to do.  Failing that, maintainers should point
contributors who want to do 
cleanup patches toward the staging tree.  Christoph Hellwig complained that
a lot of time has been wasted on "horrible" white-space patches, but Greg
responded that getting started in kernel development is hard.  We should
be nice to developers and let them start with an easy patch.  Christoph
protested that encouraging developers to do the "wrong thing" was not
actually nice, but others disagreed.  A quick straw poll of the room
verified that a number of maintainers have seen developers who start with
cleanup patches move on to more substantive work.
<p>
The real recruitment problem, Greg said, has to do with finding
intermediate-level tasks for developers.  When the kernel got started, the
holes in functionality were big, there was lots of stuff to work on, and
just about anybody could find a useful task to do.  Now the holes are small

and it's not always obvious what work should be done.  To that end, Greg asked
maintainers to send their to-do lists to him so that he can make a combined
list available to interested developers.
<p>
Greg also suggested participating in programs like Outreachy and the Google
Summer of Code (GSoC).  We all should be looking to replace ourselves, he
said.  There is a particular need for more Outreachy mentors.  Outreachy,
he said, has brought in people with good skills, a number of whom are now
doing Linux development work at companies.  Keith Packard said
that the X.org community has worked with both Outreachy and GSoC.  The
amount of work required to mentor Outreachy interns was too much, Keith
said, but GSoC has been 
great.  There was general agreement among those who have done this work
that GSoC is an easier place for mentors to start.
Ben Herrenschmidt said that a lot of developers are doing this sort of work
within their companies.
<p>
Linus said that the request for intermediate tasks was ironic, given what
he has seen in the community.  He is not against white-space patches,
though he is not excited by them either.  But he gets annoyed when
developers accept the white-space patches, then argue against patches that
are real improvements.  He mentioned <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2039243">one
first-time patch posting</a> from a developer who was trying to improve the
code that resulted in a frightening email thread.  We need to be
nicer to developers who are sending real code improvements, he said, and
encourage developers doing white-space work to look at the code instead.
Ben noted that this was a classic example of the bikeshed problem: there is
no shortage of people who will comment on simple patches.
<p>
Christoph said that he prefers to see self-driven people coming into our
community.  They need to have enthusiasm or they won't stick with it.  Dan
Williams said that we, as a community, are good at killing enthusiasm, be
it by not responding to patches or arguing over little details.  We should
remember, he said, that maintainership is a service role and act
accordingly.
<p>
The session wound down with a final suggestion that writing tests might be
a good task for beginning kernel developers.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
I cannot speak for the kernel, but in the project I work on (NumPy), I find writing good tests harder and more time consuming than writing the code to be tested.<br>

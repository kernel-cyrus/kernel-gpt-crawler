<h1>Is hyperthreading dangerous?</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
Hyperthreading (or symmetric multi-threading) is a hardware technique used
to squeeze more performance out of modern processors.  A hyperthreaded
processor appears, in many ways, to be a set of two independent
processors.  These two processors share the same hardware, however,
with only the processor registers and other state-dependent information
being kept separate.  Only one of the two CPUs can actually be executing at one
time.  Hyperthreading helps performance because processors often stall,
waiting for memory accesses.  When one processor in a hyperthreaded set
must wait, the other can be executing.  Hyperthreading thus enables greater
utilization of the processor hardware; the resulting performance gains are
said to be anywhere from 5% to 30%, depending on the workload.
<p>

One of the resources shared by hyperthreaded processor sets is the memory
cache.  This sharing has its advantages: if processes running on the two
processors are sharing memory, that memory need only be fetched into the
cache once.  That kind of sharing happens often; shared libraries are one
obvious example.  The shared cache also makes moving processes between
hyperthreaded processors an inexpensive operation, so keeping loads
balanced across the system is easier.
<p>

The sharing of caches between hyperthreaded processors is also, however,
the cause of a vulnerability identified in a heavily trailered <a
href="http://www.daemonology.net/hyperthreading-considered-harmful/">report</a>
by Colin Percival.  The core of the problem is that, by measuring the
latency of specific memory accesses, a process can tell whether a given
memory location was represented in the processor cache or not.  A hostile
process can load the cache with its own memory, wait a bit, then run tests
to see which locations have been evicted from the cache.  From that
information, it can make inferences about which memory locations were
accessed by the sibling processor in the hyperthreaded set.
<p>

Two cooperating processes, running at different privilege levels, could
make use of the cache to set up a covert channel for communication.  In a
highly secured system, these two processes might not be able to talk to
each other at all normally.  With a covert channel in place, information
can be leaked from a privileged level to one less privileged, leading to
all kinds of dreadful consequences - for somebody.  Most systems, however,
are not overly concerned about this sort of covert channel; there are
easier ways to deliberately leak information.

<p>
Mr. Percival, however, also shows how the vulnerability can be exploited to
obtain information from processes which are not cooperating.  In
particular, he claims that it can be used to steal keys from cryptographic
applications.  A number of crypto algorithms have data-dependent memory
access patterns; an attacker who can watch memory accesses can, for some
algorithms, derive the key which was being used.  The exploit discussed in
the report attacks the OpenSSL key signing algorithm in this way.

<p>
The paper makes a number of recommendations on steps which can be taken to
mitigate this problem.  The simplest is to simply disable hyperthreading;
on Linux systems, it is a simple matter of configuring out hyperthreading
support or booting with the <tt>noht</tt> option.  Alternatively, the
kernel could take care not to schedule potentially unfriendly processes on
the same hyperthreaded set.  Removing access to a high-resolution clock
would make the necessary timing information unavailable, thus defeating
such attacks.  Cryptographic algorithms could be rewritten to avoid
data-dependent memory access patterns.  Processors could be redesigned
to not share caches between hyperthreaded siblings, or to use a cache
eviction algorithm which makes it harder to determine which cache lines
have been removed.

<p>
The Linux scheduler could certainly be changed to defeat attempted cache-based
attacks on hyperthreaded processors, but the chances of that happening are
small.  There are numerous obstacles to any sort of real-world exploit of
this vulnerability.  The attacker must be able to run a CPU-intensive program on
the target system - without being noticed - and ensure that it remains on
the same hyperthreaded processor as the cryptographic process.  The data
channel is noisy at best, and it will be made much more so by any other
processes running on the system.  Timing the attack (knowing when the
target process is performing cryptographic calculations, rather than doing
something else) is tricky.  Getting past all these roadblocks is
likely to keep a would-be key thief busy for some time.
<p>

In other words, there are almost certainly more effective ways of attacking
cryptographic applications.  Closing this particular hole is unlikely to be
worth the trouble, extra complexity in the kernel, and performance impact
it would require.  So this vulnerability, despite all the press it has
obtained, will probably not lead to any changes to the kernel in the near
future.  Anybody who is truly worried about this problem will be best off
simply turning off hyperthreading for now.  In the longer term, authors of
cryptographic code may find that they need to add avoidance of
data-dependent memory access patterns to their arsenal of techniques.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Does this very theoretical exploit affect multicore systems too? I'm not sure I have this right, but I think they sharing cache too. Or is the (still very theorietical) exploit dependent on the feature that the hostile thread and the cryptographic one do not run at the same time?<br>
<p>
In any case, I have the answer:<br>
&lt;TIC&gt;This is the perfect exploit to close with security thorugh obscurity. We have to lessen the risque that the two processes happen to be in the same processor cache at the same time. This is best (depending on wether you share my definition of 'best') done by getting an 8-way SMP system, preferably dualcore. (Well, at least _I_ would prefer that, wouldn't you?) Thus the chance would be slim, at best, that the two processes would schedule to the same processor at the same time. (Now, all I need is to persuade my wife that this is necessary in the name of security.)&lt;/TIC&gt;<br>

<p>Yes and no. Yes - it's possible to use the same technique for dual-core systems. But in reality it'll require <b>way</b> too much brute force. The problem with Hyper-Threading is size of L1 cache - it's too small. Multicore systems only share L2 cache (if even that) and it's much bigger so problem becomes pure theory.</p>

      IIRC, the initial dual-cores from AMD and Intel will not share any cache.   <br>
Intel's (initial) implementation in particular is basically two  <br>
independent CPUs on the same die.  Even when shared L2 caches are <br>
implemented, it seems that sharing an L2 cache will provide lower <br>
bandwidth to this kind of exploit, which benefits hugely from the shared <br>
L1 cache of the two hyperthreads. <br>
  <br>
Note that IBM's POWER4 shares caches across multiple cores and the POWER5 <br>
also has SMT...  <br>

      I would question whether it is even possible to make cryptographic computations optimally secure on a highly complex system shared with potentially hostile processes. This kind of attack highlights the kind of difficulties involved. If cryptography is only one of very many things done on a highly complex system, it seems to me unlikely that the security of this cryptography will be done very well. I think a simpler and likely to be more effective approach, once appropriate hardware becomes more generally available, is for the cryptography to occur on dedicated processors, designed to make obtaining access to embedded private keys very difficult and expensive.<br>

      <i>... is for the cryptography to occur on dedicated processors, designed to make obtaining access to embedded private keys very difficult and expensive. </i><p>
If the cryptographic keys are mission critical, they must be backed up.  The backups also have to be protected, even when stored off site.   
I think that the most significant benefit of a dedicated processor is that you can have a very different scheme for backing up the crypto hardware than for your other servers.<p>

      Albeit I may pay for it later, this is a great place where TPM (Trusted Computing) could be used. Within the TPM system, the chip responsible for key management is the only one that can ever "see" the keys being used.<br>
<p>
Any time a key goes out, it's encrypted. So, you can send in an encrypted key, a datastream, and an encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify instruction... the chip does the magic required, and spits out whichever data was asked for.<br>
<p>
Note: While Palladium is evil. I actually like TPM. (My ThinkPad has it, but I havn't had the opportunity to set it up yet).<br>
<p>
<p>
To make a desparate attempt for on-topic-ness: I disliked HTT from the beginning. It didn't seem worth paying for... It makes more sense (to me) to fine-tune cache performance.<br>

      Interestingly, when the mergemem pacth (<a href="http://mergemem.ist.org/">http://mergemem.ist.org/</a>) was proposed in 1998, it was accompanied by a note stating a similar security concern. (Hostile programs could generate pages and see whether memory usage go up or not, and deduce they were merged).<br>
<p>
Avoidance of data-dependent memory access patterns is already in use in smartcard devices (it is much easier to exploit once you have stolen the smartcard, though).<br>

      If one could only check whether full pages are merged, that would be<br>
pretty hard to exploit (one would have to guess all of the page<br>
correctly, i.e., usually the complete key or password).<br>
<p>
Another potential attack path was using a timing attack based on how<br>
long the merge attempt takes, or how much of the merge-attempted pages<br>
is in the cache afterwards.  That would bring the granularity down to<br>
a word or a cache line, which makes guessing much more practical.<br>
<p>
IMO, even that attack path could be blocked relatively easily (e.g.,<br>
allow only merging corresponding pages from processes that run the<br>
same binary, and were not tainted with ptrace or somesuch).<br>
<p>
My impression was that too much emphasis was given to the<br>
vulnerabilities in the mergemem announcements, and that may be one<br>
reason why there was not much interest in it.<br>

      If what I've read is correct, hyperthreading increases processor efficiency in the event of a stalled pipeline (such as for a mispredicted branch, or a subroutine entry/exit), but doesn't provide any extra execution units for parallelism.  A 30% upper end to speed improvement is about right, but the bottom end is more like -5%.  For two CPU bound tasks both of which are contending for cache-lines and each with relatively long spans of instructions between function calls (typically C code instead of C++) Hyperthreading can cause thrashing in the L1 and L2 cache for a net drop in performance.<br>

      HT doesn't provide extra functional units but it may enable better use of <br>
the functional units available, as well as allowing the CPU to continue <br>
working in the event one thread stalls. <br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, with cache contention (and the different mix of functional <br>
units required by different threads), the performance benefits can be <br>
highly variable - scheduling-wise it's a whole new can of worms!!! <br>

At least one affected cryptographic library has been evaluating ways to mitigate this issue.  OpenSSL is adding contsant-time exponentiation:<br>

      A little quibble about the first paragraph: hyperthreads actually do run <br>
truly simultaneously, which is what distinguishes Simultaneous <br>
MultiThreading from Fine Grained MultiThreading.  This gives the <br>
additional benefit of being able to use issue slots in a superscalar CPU <br>
that would otherwise be wasted.  Of course, if one stalls, you still get <br>
the benefit that the other thread carries on keeping the processor busy. <br>
 <br>
Since modern x86 CPUs internally use register renaming and figure out <br>
instruction dependencies dynamically, I've always suspected that adding HT <br>
didn't require many (or perhaps any) changes to the middle part of the <br>
pipeline. <br>

<h1>Unreviewed code in 3.11</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 7, 2013</br>
           </div>
Kernel development, like development in most free software projects, is
built around the concept of peer review.  All patches should be reviewed by
at least one other developer; that, it is hoped, will catch bugs before
they are merged and lead to a higher-quality end result.  While a lot of
code review does take place in the kernel project, it is also clearly the
case that a certain amount of code goes in without ever having been looked
at by anybody other than the original developer.  A couple of recent
episodes bear a closer look; they show why the community values code review
and the hazards of skipping it.
<p>
<h4>O_TMPFILE</h4>
<p>
The <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> option to the <tt>open()</tt> system call was pulled
into the mainline during the 3.11 merge window; prior to that pull, it had
not been posted in any public location.  There is no doubt that it provides
a useful feature; it allows an application to open a file in a given
filesystem with no visible name.  In one stroke, it does away with a whole
range of temporary file vulnerabilities, most of which are based on
guessing which name will be used.  <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> can also be used with
the <tt>linkat()</tt> system call to create a file and make it visible in
the filesystem, with the right permissions, in a single atomic step.  There
can be no doubt that application developers will want to make good use of
this functionality once it becomes widely available.
<p>
That said, <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> has been going through a bit of a rough
start.  It did not take long for Linus to express <a
href="/Articles/558949/">concerns</a> about the new API; in short, there
was no way for applications to determine that they were running on a system
where <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> was <i>not</i> supported.  A couple of patches
later, those issues had been addressed.  Since then, a couple of bugs have
been found in the implementation; one, <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/e94bd3490f4ef342801cfc76b33d8baf9ccc9437">fixed</a>
by Zheng Liu, would oops the kernel.  Another, <a
href="/Articles/562296/">reported</a> by Andy Lutomirski, corrupts the
underlying filesystem through the creation 
of a bogus inode.  Finally, few filesystems actually support this
new option at this point, so it is not something that developers can count
on having available, even on Linux systems.

</blockquote>
<p>
Meanwhile, Christoph Hellwig has <a href="/Articles/562297/">questioned the
API</a> chosen for this feature:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Why is the useful tmpfile functionality multiplexed over open when
	it has very different semantics from a normal open?

	In addition to the flag problems already discussed to death it also
	just leads to splattering of the code in the implementation [...]
</div>
<p>
Christoph suggests that it would have been better to create a new
<tt>tmpfile()</tt> system call rather than adding this feature to
<tt>open()</tt>.  In the end, he has <a href="/Articles/562298/">said</a>,
<tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> needs some more time:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Given all the problems and very limited fs support I'd much prefer
	disabling O_TMPFILE for this release.  That'd give it the needed
	exposure it was missing by being merged without any previous public
	review.
</div>
<p>
Neither Al Viro (the author of this feature) nor Linus has responded to
Christoph's suggestions, leading one to believe that the current plan is to
go ahead with the current implementation.  Once the <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> ABI
is exposed in the 3.11 release, it will need to be supported indefinitely.
It certainly is supportable in its current form, but it may well have come
out better with a bit more discussion prior to merging.
<p>
<a name="security"></a>
<h4>Secret security fixes</h4>
<p>
Russell King's pre-3.11-rc4 pull request does not appear to have been
sent to any public list.  Based on <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/6d039f8f037fda35da8124f09c4d2bbe55c9a575">the
merge commit</a> in the mainline, what Russell said about this request was:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I've thought long and hard about what to say for this pull request,
  	and I really can't work out anything sane to say to summarise much
  	of these commits.  The problem is, for most of these are, yet
  	again, lots of small bits scattered around the place without any
  	real overall theme to them.
</div>
<p>

Evidently, the fact that eight out of the 22 commits in that request were
security fixes does not constitute a "real overall theme."  The patches
seem like worthwhile hardening for the ARM architecture, <a
href="/Articles/562443/">evidently</a> written in response to disclosures
made at the recently concluded <a
href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-13/">Black Hat USA 2013</a> event.  While
most of the patches carry an Acked-by from Nicolas Pitre, none of them saw
any kind of public review before heading into the mainline.

<p>
It was not long before Olof Johansson <a
href="/Articles/562301/">encountered a number of problems</a> with the
changes, leading to several systems that were unable to boot.  LWN reader
kalvdans pointed out <a href="/Articles/562134/">a different obvious bug</a>
in the code.  Olof
suggested that, perhaps, the patches might have benefited from some time in
the linux-next repository, but Russell <a
href="/Articles/562302/">responded:</a>
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Tell me how I can put this stuff into -next _and_ keep it secret
	because it's security related.  The two things are totally
	incompatible with each other.  Sorry.
</div>
<p>
In this case, it is far from clear that much was gained by taking these
patches out of the normal review process.  The list of distributors rushing
to deploy these fixes to users prior to their public disclosure is likely
to be quite short, and, in any case, the cure, as was merged for 3.11-rc4,
was worse than the disease.  As of this writing, neither bug has been fixed
in the mainline, though patches exist for both.  
<p>
That said, one can certainly imagine scenarios where it might make sense to
develop and merge a fix outside of public view.  If a security
vulnerability is known to be widely exploitable, one wants to get the fix
as widely distributed as possible before the attackers are able to develop
their exploits.  In many cases, though, the vulnerabilities are not readily
exploitable, or, as is the case for the bulk of deployed ARM systems, there
is no way to quickly distribute an update in any case.  In numerous other
cases, the vulnerability in question has been known to the attacker
community for a long time before it comes to the attention of a kernel
developer.
<p>
For all of those cases, chances are high that the practice of developing
fixes in secret does more harm than good.  As has been seen here, such
fixes can introduce bugs of their own; sometimes, those new bugs can be new
security problems as well.  In other situations, as in the
<tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> case, unreviewed code also runs the risk of introducing
suboptimal APIs that must then be maintained for many years.  The code
review practices we have developed over the years exist for a reason;
bypassing those practices introduces a whole new set of risks to the kernel
development process.  The 3.11 development cycle has demonstrated just how
real those risks can be.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

That reminds me of Spender's crusade against kernel maintainers lying about security impact of patches. This "secrecy" is really off-putting (and a nice attack vector for someone wanting to slip in a backdoor, or something).<br>

<p>
There is an ongoing effort to "modernize" the kernel-development process;
so far, the focus has been on <a href="/Articles/811528/">providing better
tools</a> that can streamline the usual email-based workflow.  But that
"email-based" part has proven to be problematic for some potential
contributors, especially those who might want to simply submit a small bug
fix and are not interested in getting set up with that workflow.  The
project-hosting "forge" sites, like GitHub and GitLab, provide a nearly
frictionless path for these kinds of one-off contributions, but they do
not mesh well—at all, really—with most of mainline kernel development.
There is some ongoing work that may change all of that, however.
</p>

<p>
Konstantin Ryabitsev at the Linux Foundation has been spearheading much of this
work going back at least as far as his <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20190912120602.GC29277@pure.paranoia.local/">September&nbsp;2019
draft proposal</a> for better kernel tooling.  Those ideas were discussed at the <a
href="/Articles/799134/">2019 Kernel Maintainers Summit</a> and at a <a
href="/Articles/803619/">meeting at Open Source Summit Europe&nbsp;2019</a>
in October.  Throughout, Ryabitsev has been looking at ways to make it easier for
non-email patch submitters; along the way, he has also released the <a
href="https://people.kernel.org/monsieuricon/introducing-b4-and-patch-attestation"><tt>b4</tt>
tool for collecting up patches</a> and worked on <a
href="/Articles/813646/">patch attestation</a>.  
</p>

<p>
A recent <a
href="/ml/workflows/20210616171813.bwvu6mtl4ltotf7p@nitro.local/">post</a>
to the kernel workflows mailing list shows some progress toward a bot that can turn
a GitHub pull request (PR) into a well-formed patch series to send to the
proper reviewers and mailing lists. "<q>This would be a one-way
operation, effectively turning Github into a 
fancy 'git-send-email' replacement.</q>"  He also laid out some of the
benefits that this bot could provide both for maintainers and patch
submitters:
<blockquote class="bq">
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> submitters would no longer need to navigate their way around
  git-format-patch, get_maintainer.pl, and git-send-email -- nor would need to
  have a patch-friendly outgoing mail gateway to properly contribute patches
<li> subsystem maintainers can configure whatever CI pre-checks they want before
  the series is sent to them for review (and we can work on a library of
  Github actions, so nobody needs to reimplement checkpatch.pl multiple times)
<li> the bot should (eventually) be clever enough to automatically track v1..vX
  on pull request updates, assuming the API makes it straightforward
</ul>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
He had some questions about whether the bot should be centralized in a
single repository (per forge platform) that would serve as the single
submission point, or whether subsystem maintainers would want to configure their own
repositories.  The latter would give maintainers the opportunity to set their own
criteria for checks that would need to pass (e.g. <tt>checkpatch.pl</tt>)
before the PR was considered valid, but would mean that they might have to ride
herd on the repository as well.
</p>

<p>
In addition, Ryabitsev wondered when and how PRs would get closed.  The bot
could potentially monitor the mainline and auto-close PRs once the patch set
gets merged, but that won't be perfect, of course.  An easier approach for
him would be "<q>to auto-close the pull request right after it's sent to the list with
  a message like 'thank you, please monitor your email for the rest of the
  process'</q>", but he was unsure if that would be best.
</p>

<p>
As might be guessed, reactions from those participating in the thread were
all over the map.  While there is a lack of many kinds of diversity within
the kernel community, opinions on development workflow—opinions, in
general, in truth—do not have that problem.  Some maintainers have zero
interest in this kind of effort at all.  As Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/ml/workflows/YMsGoI0UdbmUebhX@infradead.org/">put it</a>:
"<q>Please opt all subsystems I maintain out of this crap.  The last
thing 
I need is patches from people that can't deal with a sane workflow.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Hellwig's complaint, which Jiri Kosina <a
href="/ml/workflows/nycvar.YFH.7.76.2106171031220.18969@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">agreed
with</a>, may be more about the expectations of those who use GitHub (and
the like), and less about the possibility of having a web-based interface to
kernel development.  Dmitry Vyukov <a
href="/ml/workflows/CACT4Y+YoHYCKaLdZFSLqKsMz1j72i=k12FVpmSo-OyB7rCorsw@mail.gmail.com/">asked</a>
why Hellwig and Kosina would be unwilling to accept patches from the system
if they cannot really distinguish them from a regular submission.  Vyukov
said that he is currently experiencing a Git email submission problem that he
is uninterested in working around, so he can see why others might be
similarly inclined.  Meanwhile, though, he sees benefits from this
kind of bot:
<blockquote class="bq">
On the other hand this workflow has the potential to ensure that you
never need to remind to run checkpatch.pl, nor spend time on writing
code formatting comments and re-reviewing v2 because code formatting
will be enforced, etc. So I see how this is actually beneficial for
maintainers.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Hellwig is <a href="/ml/workflows/YMsfXuykH6z0ZbpM@infradead.org/">not
opposed</a> to a web-based solution, though he wants nothing to do with
GitHub.  But Ryabitsev <a 
href="/ml/workflows/20210617145728.nahkvtxapozccm6c@nitro.local/">seems
uninterested</a> in "<q>reimplementing a lot of stuff that we already get 'for
free' from Github and other forges</q>".  Both <a
href="/ml/workflows/20210617151659.GF5067@sirena.org.uk/">Mark Brown</a>
and <a
href="/ml/workflows/YMtpHPaJzMxmhslt@pendragon.ideasonboard.com/">Laurent
Pinchart</a> suggested that there are mismatches between GitHub-normal practices
and those of the kernel community.  Pinchart mentioned the inability to
comment on a patch's commit message on GitHub as something that generally leads
to poor messages; the platform is training these developers to a certain
extent:
<blockquote class="bq">
Developers who have only been exposed to those platforms are very likely
to never have learnt the importance of commit messages, and of proper
split of changes across commits. Those are issues that are inherent to
those platforms and that we will likely need to handle in an automated
way (at least to some extent) or maintainers will become crazy [...]
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
But Miguel Ojeda <a
href="/ml/workflows/CANiq72n-L=aroXFfnoF96Edk6F7+hqHu_BTaKuKAeA0MgOcSbw@mail.gmail.com/">thinks</a>
that it is really no different from new developers showing up on the
mailing list with patches. "<q>The same happens in the LKML -- some
people have sent bad messages, 
but we correct them and they learn.</q>"  He also <a
href="/ml/workflows/CANiq72kW+xsCWyhaT20a2=PUjUB59ujomaarnBrTDuYo1KEuJA@mail.gmail.com/">noted</a>
that automated checking of patches can help both developers and
maintainers:
<blockquote class="bq">
[...]  it is particularly useful to teach newcomers and to
save time for maintainers having to explain things. Even if a
maintainer has a set of email templates for the usual things, it takes
time vs. not even having to read the email.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Ojeda is <a href="/Articles/860160/">working</a> on the <a
href="https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux">Rust for 
Linux project</a>, which we <a href="/Articles/853423/">looked at</a> back
in April; he <a
href="/ml/workflows/CANiq72=qmGRTUYzXs_FP0Y2_pJOm=5O7bSTBwXawH29oTApuuw@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that he has also been working on a bot:
<blockquote class="bq">
For Rust for Linux, I have a GitHub bot that reviews PRs and spots the
usual mistakes in commit messages (tags, formatting, lkml vs. lore
links, that sort of thing). It has been very effective so far to teach
newcomers how to follow the kernel development process.
<p>
I am also extending it to take Acks, Reviewed-by's, Tested-by's, etc.,
and then performing the merge only if the CI passes (which includes
running tests under QEMU, code formatting, lints, etc.) after applying
each patch.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
But Ojeda is taking things in a rather different direction than what Ryabitsev is
envisioning.  Ojeda wants to move the main place for patch review and the
like from the mailing lists to GitHub.  He is also considering having his
bot pick up patches from the mailing list and turning them into GitHub
PRs—the reverse of what Ryabitsev is doing.
</p>

<p>
For his part, Ryabitsev <a
href="/ml/workflows/20210616182252.flsdrkjuw2etwcud@nitro.local/">said</a>:
"<q>That's pretty cool, but I'm opposed to this on theological
grounds. :)</q>"  In particular, he is concerned about the "single point
of failure" problem for the kernel-development infrastructure.  If his bot
is unavailable for any reason, it may be inconvenient for those who use it,
but that will not hobble development.  He sees GitHub as simply a
"<q>developer frontend tool</q>". 
</p>

<p>
Somewhat similar to Ojeda's intentions, Brendan Higgins <a
href="/ml/workflows/CAFd5g44cerCLF6yd_voFAEr9B+G4bLPve-ARVv8N30pHj9Zdzg@mail.gmail.com/">has
a tool</a> to pick up patches from a mailing
list (kselftest in this case) and upload them to a <a
href="https://linux-review.googlesource.com/">Gerrit instance</a>.  He sees
some potential synergies between his bot and the one Ryabitsev is working on.
Similarly, Drew DeVault <a
href="/ml/workflows/CC57UCW5H2NE.3A6404HP4WC2Z@taiga/">has been working
on</a> the reverse direction, from a mailing list to a project forge, as
well.
<a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/">Patchwork</a> is a
longstanding code-review project that also collects up patches from mailing lists to
populate a web application.
It would seem that much of the focus is on getting patches
<i>out</i> of mailing lists, though, which is not where Ryabitsev is headed.
</p>

<p>
While some maintainers want no part of this "GitHub Future", others are
enthusiastic about the possibilities it could bring.  Vyukov <a
href="/ml/workflows/CACT4Y+ZYG5EB3re0Lby920Atkmb7e_FthN_5XO881XOhF_iJzg@mail.gmail.com/">thinks</a>
that having a single GitHub repository with multiple branches will help
consolidate the kernel-development landscape, which is currently fragmented
on subsystem lines.  He sees it as an opportunity to apply consistent
coding-style standards; it does not matter which, he said, "<q>as long as it's
consistent across the project</q>".   It would also allow testing
consistency throughout the tree and the same for the development process:
<blockquote class="bq">
For once: it will be possible to have proper documentation on the
process (as compared to current per-subsystem rules, which are usually
not documented again because of low RoI [return on investment] for anything related to a
single subsystem only).
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
It is not at all clear that Vyukov's interest in consistency throughout the
tree is shared widely, but there have certainly been complaints along the
way about the difficulty of navigating between the different subsystem
processes and requirements for submissions.  There is also interest in
making things easier for quick, one-off contributions; as Ryabitsev <a
href="/ml/workflows/20210616180543.wevddhlzq4ow22f5@nitro.local/">put
it</a>:
<blockquote class="bq">
Our code review process must also
allow for what is effectively a "report a typo" link. Currently, this is
extremely onerous for anyone, as a 15-minute affair suddenly becomes a
herculean effort. The goal of this work is to make drive-by patches easier
without also burying maintainers under a pile of junk submissions.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Clearly keeping "junk submissions" to a bare minimum is going to be
important. Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/workflows/CAHk-=whEZ23h_Gvg3aOuQgXbUjxn6gwvcS2dHawkPgpDwKmssw@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that he has had to turn off email from GitHub because it is too noisy;
people have apparently signed him up as a project member without any kind
of opt-in check.  Beyond that, any kind of patch submission from PRs would
need to have some sanity checks, including size limits, so that PRs like <a
href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/779">one pointed out by Ryabitsev</a>
do not end up on the mailing list.
</p>

<p>
That kind of PR highlights another problem: repository maintenance.  Greg
Kroah-Hartman <a href="/ml/workflows/YMr5+ibXI5huLy7h@kroah.com/">said</a>
that there will be a need to monitor whatever repositories are being used
for this purpose.  It is not a small task:
<blockquote class="bq">
What ever repo you put this on, it's going to take constant maintenance
to keep it up to date and prune out the PRs that are going to accumulate
there, as well as deal with the obvious spam and abuse issues that
popular trees always accumulate.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Torvalds does not want his GitHub tree used for this purpose and
Kroah-Hartman said the same.  However it plays out, someone will have to be
tasked with keeping the repository tidy, which is "<q>a thankless task
that will take constant work</q>".  But Ryabitsev is <a
href="/ml/workflows/20210617145934.jsbapuf65b5t54q4@nitro.local/">hopeful</a>
that the Linux Foundation could fund that kind of work if it becomes
necessary. 
</p>

<p>
In the end, it will likely come down to how seamlessly the GitHub bot fits
in.  If maintainers truly cannot really tell the difference in any
substantive way, it is hard to see many of them rejecting well-formed
patches that fix real problems in their subsystems.  That ideal may not be
reached right away, however, which might lead to a premature end to the
experiment.   It will be interesting to see it all play out over the coming
months and years.

Not necessarily. Not knowing Github, but if interacting via Github introduces friction, especially if it&#x27;s painful friction, then that statement is both understandable and excusable.<br>

I could understand if it were &quot;I don&#x27;t want to interact with anyone via GitHub&quot;, but that&#x27;s not what was said. It&#x27;s like if I said &quot;I don&#x27;t want to interact with anyone who uses public transport&quot; versus &quot;I don&#x27;t want to use public transport&quot; (purely hypothetical, I personally have loved public transport where I have successfully used it).<br>

As long as GitHub doesn&#x27;t support PRs from git repositories not hosted on GitHub servers and requires an account to even send a PR or small patch, fuck GitHub. This vendor lock-in and Ojeda approach (&quot;Ojeda wants to move the main place for patch review and the like from the mailing lists to GitHub.&quot;) shouldn&#x27;t be acceptable for kernel development.<br>
<p>
Any solution to kernel-development problems, should be at least as decentralized as email and git are. I don&#x27;t mind being subscribed to the kernel mailing lists with email address hosted on my server (still subscription is not necessary to contribute to the kernel), I do mind if I&#x27;m forced to have an account on microsoft-owned platform to contribute even the smallest patch.<br>

Neither was Bitkeeper. With luck the lessons from there will still be strong enough to avoid any vendor lockin in terms of the primary approaches to contributing to the kernel, but there are already people who use proprietary software to contribute to Linux and there are already people who use Github who would like to contribute to Linux, and I think there&#x27;s a meaningful benefit in enabling that.<br>

We are not putting ourselves in the hands of a single corporation.<br>
<p>
GitHub offers a service which is useful to us. If tomorrow GitHub stops being useful or a new, better service appears, we will migrate. Migrating is easy enough.<br>

And, to be clear, the usual ML-based workflow still works and GitHub is not stopping us from using it.<br>

Migration is not easy. All issues and pull requests are tied to GitHub user accounts. All &#x27;stars&#x27; are tied to GitHub user accounts. These cannot be moved.<br>
<p>
GitHub has a lock-in by login.<br>
<p>
Using email for development removes the information intermediary.<br>
<p>
Any web based front-end that uses cryptographically signed issues, PRs, &#x27;stars&#x27; and other contributions where the private keys are not part of the website would be fine.<br>

Stars are pretty meaningless to workflows, so that doesn&#x27;t seem all that important. Yes, issues and PRs being attributed to user accounts makes it harder to find out who to contact about it once moving, but that&#x27;s the case if someone changes their email address (say, employment change, de-Googlification, or whatever).<br>
<p>
In any case, the important bits are still retrievable just as easily in an email workflow. Using that information can be easier or harder depending on circumstances, but there&#x27;s no guarantee that any of that works in an arbitrary future anyways.<br>

The issue I see with the negativity directed at &quot;github-first&quot; developers is that most young devs started programming using github (including myself). I understand the comments about bad commit messages, also one of my pet peeves for devs, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an insurmountable issue to direct people to the appropriate places, I learnt a lot from the git commit message guide on one of the &quot;become a linux contributor&quot; pages, and continue to use it in my day-to-day programming, but have never contributed to Linux. I would say that again, as a newer, younger dev, that the processes and gigantic list of things to do before contributing is off putting. I get why that amount of pre-work exists for such a large project, but I understand both sides of the argument.<br>

Last month, as part of Google Summer of Code I worked with my student on her first submissions to QEMU. She had never seen any of &quot;git rebase -i&quot;, &quot;git add -p&quot;, &quot;git format-patch&quot;, &quot;git send-email&quot; but she was able to learn everything in a matter of hours. The &quot;send patches as email&quot; part, which really is the &quot;gigantic list of things to do before contributing&quot; that you mention, was the least of her worries compared to actually getting the code in good shape for submission.<br>

Of course but not true for correcting a typo. Even github does not come easy some doc writers BTW.<br>

Um, I&#x27;ve sent one-off patches via email as a nobody.  They either were late to the party or superseded by better fixes (except for one trivial patch), but there was no friction.  And this was before many of the layers of porcelain.<br>
<p>
Because of my current work, I have to deal with one of the &quot;forges.&quot;  Not really useful to me, and in general we do better with email / teleconf for issues anyways.  I wish I could redirect us to jit.si for the teleconf bits, but whatever.<br>
<p>
Email sits on my laptop.  I can search and process it in a zillion ways not yet imagined by the servers.  But that&#x27;s *my* workflow.  Plus: git was designed to be distributed, learning from some other centralized systems that fell down and went boom.  Cross-system pull requests have yet to reach any consensus and likely never will (commercialization requirements, just like how IETF ical doesn&#x27;t support exceptions).  But git format-patch provides a consensus and cross-platform format for some projects.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; but there was no friction.</font><br>
<p>
Developers who have been doing the &quot;email a patch&quot; workflow for years tend to underestimate the amount of friction involved, because most of it is &quot;obvious stuff.&quot; Of course you have to format your patches correctly, send email as plain text, CC the mailing list for the right subsystem, etc. Those things are all &quot;obvious,&quot; and once you know how they are done, they are genuinely easy to do, so they don&#x27;t get counted towards the total amount of friction in the system. But for new contributors, they are indeed friction and should be considered, assuming you actually want to attract new developers.<br>
<p>
The main advantage that GitHub and other forges offer is discoverability. If you want to make a fork of someone&#x27;s repository, there&#x27;s a button for that. If you want to send a pull request, there&#x27;s a button for that. If you want to file a bug, there&#x27;s a button for that. You don&#x27;t have to read some FAQ that tells you which mailing list to email and in what format, you just click around the interface until you find the button that does what you want.<br>
<p>
Sure, this makes things easier for the developer. That doesn&#x27;t mean the developer is dumber, just that they are expending fewer cognitive resources on meaningless administrivia, and more on actually programming. It used to be, if you made a syntax error, you&#x27;d find out about it the next day, when you got back the output of your code from the sysadmins. I&#x27;m sure the programmers of that era were better at spotting trivial syntax errors than we are today, but I&#x27;m skeptical that &quot;spotting syntax errors&quot; has anything to do with actual programming skills.<br>

<p>
In GH there&#x27;s no real revision method, I constantly click on links only to get &quot;did not find what you&#x27;re looking for&quot; (paraphrased) as the branch got force pushed, or a pull requested abandoned/closed and the new one was not linked in the old, as that is really only happening if a user comments &quot;replaces #12345&quot; or the like.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; - Fine-grained notifications to anything - from nothing to everything. The recipient is in control.</font><br>
<p>
x-sieve (I&#x27;m not maintaining those directly, open-xchange has a nice web-gui for it) and mailing list subscriptions are way more flexible though, GH got a bit better recently, the recipient may even be in control, but what use if the choices are &quot;scalding hot&quot; or &quot;freezing cold&quot;.<br>
<p>
So I&#x27;m really not sold that *those* are the main advantages.<br>

Yes, Github&#x27;s institutional denial of rebase being useful is…not nice. GitLab has been better AFAIK. And to plug ghostflow again, it keeps refs to every update it sees[1] if folks want archival information). Any commits that are checked get their own specific ref (the `refs/check/mr/X/Y` is the Yth update to MR X) so they stick around.<br>
<p>
[1]Of course you can race and push twice before ghostflow fetches the middle one, but if you&#x27;re winning that race, what are you really gaining?<br>

When I search the nets for ghostflow, then there&#x27;s almost nothing. The first result is www.ghostflow.com. When I go there the only thing I can do there is to log in. Is there a place in the electric sphere that would actually tell me what ghostflow can offer me (as opposed to me offering my email address to ghostflow)?<br>

The Repo <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-ghostflow">https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-ghostflow</a> doesn&#x27;t have a README.md and it&#x27;s description is: &quot;Routines which implement various parts of &quot;ghostflow&quot;, or the git-hosted workflow.&quot;, which basically says &quot;foo implements foo&quot;, which isn&#x27;t helpful to the reader&#x27;s understanding of what *actually* the purpose of that software is.<br>
<p>
So I suggest to link from the description of <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-ghostflow">https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-ghostflow</a> to <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/ghostflow-director/">https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/ghostflow-director/</a>, which has minimal info on what ghostflow is, or even better to add a README.md to <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-ghostflow">https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-ghostflow</a> with minimal info that at least contains that link.<br>

It&#x27;s still not great, but nowadays you can click on the &quot;force-pushed&quot; line in a PR when a force-push happens, and you see the diff before/after the push. I believe this is relatively new, or at least I wasn&#x27;t fully aware of it until this year.<br>

It&#x27;s pretty old and is one of the very few things that works when you force push to github. However it still does not perform a &quot;git range-diff&quot;[*] so the output has all the rebase noise and is unusable in case of a &quot;real&quot; rebase with an actual base change.<br>
<p>
[*] range-diff was implemented by Gerrit in 2018, before git itself <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24096">https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24096</a><br>

Just a point of note that what was upstreamed to Git came from Gerrit, but ReviewBoard was &quot;diffing the diffs&quot; way back in 2012 or so to extract out the useful update diff for rebases. I&#x27;m sure there is prior art elsewhere as well, but I&#x27;m not aware of it.<br>
<p>
And yes, I&#x27;ve been poking GitLab occasionally to finally implement that, but they always seem to have higher priority things :/ . If you plan ahead, you can rebase the diff as-is, push, then edit the topic to make useful inter-push diffs. Conflicts obvious get lost in the noise, but it&#x27;s about the best one can do on the web interfaces these days.<br>

Since you&#x27;re in the know, any chance for the git range-diff CLI to some day have a side by side mode like Gerrit does? Diffing diffs adds another dimension so using another axis is basically necessary, the display with two columns of pluses and minuses is unreadable for everything but the simplest changes. Has this been discussed already?<br>

Not sure I&#x27;d consider myself &quot;in the know&quot; :) . Just that I have wishes for things in Git that eventually get addressed (`git range-diff` and `git bisect --first-parent` being the latest two) by other kind souls who actually have time and ability to get them done. I&#x27;ve scratched my own itch (`git remote get-url` is my contribution), but some of my wishes are just to big to work on in the background. I think ReviewBoard had a way to render them as a side-by-side view, but it&#x27;s been so long…<br>

      <p>I wonder how kernel developers would feel about using <a href="https://pagure.io/pagure">Pagure</a> as a bridge to offer contemporary PR-style workflows with CI, bots, etc. Unlike GitHub, it's completely Free and Open Source software. It's also fairly minimalist and the specialized Linux kernel CI systems can easily integrate with it. Unlike <em>most</em> forges, Pagure stores nearly all of its project data as Git repositories and also supports a concept of a "remote pull request" where the user tells Pagure to pull the branch from another Git server's repo (which can even be a plain Git server!).</p>
<p>There's also work on a <a href="https://pagure.io/pagure-forgefed">ForgeFed plugin</a> to fully enable federation across Git systems that implement the ForgeFed protocol to file issues and submit pull requests.</p>
<p>The main missing piece is nobody has implemented a bridge between email and PR style workflows in Pagure (though <a href="https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/15">the developers are interested in an implementation</a>). With that, it'd be a fully free platform that could be tailored to handle preferred workflows. Even without it, it seems to have attracted <a href="https://docs.pagure.org/pagure/runs_here.html">a <em>tiny</em> bit of success</a> so far...</p>

Not exactly. We have a web UI for preparing patches which is definitely helpful for incorporating people into the email workflow. The tool I mentioned in this email thread is different: we wrote a little web service which bidirectionally syncs emails sent to a mailing list with a gitlab merge request. The former, which you were referring to, is not related to any github or github-style forges; while the latter, is.<br>

I know this isn&#x27;t exactly the place to introduce it to the kernel community (though I have posted about it on LWN before), but it&#x27;s late here and I&#x27;d like to at least get things down initially. Plus, some from the thread may read this too :) .<br>
<p>
As part of my work doing software process at $DAYJOB, I implemented what we call &quot;ghostflow&quot;[1] which is a mashup of &quot;git-hosted workflow&quot;. It currently has backends for GitLab and GitHub, but I&#x27;ve been poking around at a Pagure one off and on. Basically, it implements actions which are useful for our workflow, but it should be flexible enough to implement all kinds of actions (including doing `format-patch` behind the scenes). I&#x27;d like it to work as a command line tool (so that it doesn&#x27;t need to be &quot;deployed&quot; anywhere, but that&#x27;s not how we use it and it hasn&#x27;t seen much work beyond &quot;it&#x27;s possible&quot; and implementations for checking and reformatting code.<br>
<p>
Actions that I forsee which should be implemented for the kernel (by no means exhaustive, but informed by my contributions):<br>
<p>
  - making sure the right lists are in Cc<br>
  - make sure metadata is correct (stable, fixes tags, etc.)<br>
  - sanity checks on content (kernel-style)<br>
  - DCO checks<br>
  - collecting intra-push submission info before sending to the list(s)<br>
<p>
Of particular interest is that PRs should *not* be closed before merging. This is one of my biggest gripes with the current workflow: when my patch lands, it&#x27;s up to me to make sure it actually landed. There&#x27;s no insight into the actual maintainer workflow without traipsing around the Git forest myself. *That&#x27;s* what I&#x27;d like to see improved (as a contributor).<br>

I see a distinct lack of the non-free (as in FOSS) nature of github in this discussion, or at least the coverage here.<br>
<p>
Whether or not to integrate a web based platform into the development process is one question, and there are many pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s.<br>
<p>
However, whether or not to rely on third-party, non-free SaaS is an entirely different question.  I for myself am quite happy that the bitkeeper days are long over, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to see a return of them.<br>
<p>
So, IMHO, if at all one wants related integration with a web based &quot;pull request&quot; type tool, the discussion should be whether or not to integrate with a [potentially self-hosted] FOSS gitlab instance, or gitea, or whatever else might be out there.<br>

In fairness, I don&#x27;t see anything in the article suggesting that anyone is going to &quot;rely&quot; on GitHub. It sounds more like it&#x27;s going to become an additional option for contributing.<br>
<p>
If it became *the sole* option for contributing, that would obviously be a problem. But I can see nothing* wrong with adding many integrations for many different forges, and letting developers use what they want to use. If anything, that should reduce the risk** of having a single point of failure.<br>
<p>
* True, someone has to maintain the integrations. But presumably, if an integration is not being maintained, then nobody finds it useful enough to bother, and it can be allowed to die in peace. This is a problem that solves itself.<br>
** This risk is somewhat applicable to email, too. It is getting progressively harder and harder to turn up your own private SMTP server, in such a way that the big email providers are willing to exchange messages with it. I don&#x27;t think email is going to die tomorrow, or in the current decade, but it&#x27;s something to think about in the long run.<br>

I&#x27;d go further than that. Back in the Bitkeeper days, people who were unwilling or unable to accept the Bitkeeper license could still make use of the CVS gateway, so it was never the sole option - but I think it was pretty clear that you were at a significant disadvantage by not relying on proprietary local tooling. I&#x27;m enthusiastic about making it more straightforward to use Github as a mechanism to get involved in kernel development, but I think there would need to be pushback against it being the *primary* option, not merely against it being the sole option.<br>

I&#x27;m not seeing anything about &quot;move the Linux contribution workflow to GitHub&quot;. It&#x27;s more &quot;make GitHub a viable onramp to contributing&quot;.

For example, I fixed a bug that was reported by some automated test setup. I used the same set of Cc emails and sent it off. However, it was missing the list that needed to hear about the patch. It wasn&#x27;t until I pinged after a week of silence that this had been realized. Why did it miss the target list? I don&#x27;t know, but checkpatch and whatever hooks `send-email` has didn&#x27;t figure it out (and there were a dozen+ emails already, so spotting a missing one wasn&#x27;t easy).<br>
<p>
So this isn&#x27;t about going anywhere near what BitKeeper was. It&#x27;s about adding more roads to Rome and putting up better signage and helpful tourist centers along the way.<br>

As long as GitHub doesn&#x27;t decide to garbage collect those commits, of course. And the delta between submissions of the same patch would be inaccessible from the web interface, because there&#x27;s no way to do a range-diff  from upstream to a PR.<br>

GitLab is better, but not too much.<br>

Yes, I agree that GitHub&#x27;s interface is subpar for workflows that rewrite patches a lot. I&#x27;m not disputing that. I think it&#x27;s that people think it&#x27;s &quot;Github or nothing&quot;.<br>

In any case, ghostflow could push its check refs to the repository to force them to not be garbage collected. Any other system could probably also do the same.<br>

The delta is accessible on Github too nowadays - there&#x27;s a notitication line in the PR when a force push happens: &quot;&lt;USER&gt; force-pushed the &lt;USER&gt;:&lt;BRANCH&gt; branch from 1234 to 5678 x time ago&quot;, and the &quot;force-pushed&quot; text is a link that opens the delta before/after the force push.<br>

I believe you replied to the wrong comment, but I&#x27;ll add my experience here since it&#x27;s on my comment :) .<br>
<p>
I&#x27;m not so sure about it being the &quot;best&quot; solution. Neither are the forges. Each have their problems. One issue with email is that if it is sent to the wrong lists, adding Cc members means:<br>
<p>
  - one can make a new Message-id for the same patch or reply to a patch with a new version (hopefully everyone sees this one too)<br>
  - seeing that the patch is indeed the same, just metadata is added is a manual process<br>
  - one can also bounce the email, but this is advanced and that it was sent to those lists is not in the normal metadata<br>
<p>
As always, there is also a lack of transparency into what is happening with a patch through email. I had to manually see whether my patch was merged since there was never any feedback on the list about it after &quot;I&#x27;ll add it to my patch queue&quot; from a relevant maintainer.<br>

Talking about my personal experience:<br>
<p>
Most people will not have a MTA configured locally, and that&#x27;s needed to contribute using an email based workflow, but it&#x27;s not very very easy to configure one.<br>
<p>
After that is done, basically the hard part is getting used to using command line rather than clicky GUI. Which for some is an insurmountable issue.<br>
<p>
However, to be honest, the fact that a pull request from github is so easy to make from a browser does bring issues of low quality contributions.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;ve had pull requests from bots adding powerpc as a test platform (for python projects??), I guess with the sole purpose of consuming my travisCI credit, since this happened about the time when they stopped offering free builds and added a one time credit thing.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;ve had many others &quot;fix&quot; a thing that would break things for every other user than themselves and just never bother to reply on the request to improve their contribution.<br>
<p>
I&#x27;ve also had a censor edit the README file, and bugs opened asking me to change license, because copyleft is bad (because they can&#x27;t reuse my stuff in their proprietary stuff).<br>
<p>
To be honest, I accept pull requests because since my projects are really small, I have no power to dictate anything. But if they were larger projects, I&#x27;d absolutely want an email based workflow just to weed out the low effort contributions.<br>

Maybe in the general case but I think the intersection of those likely to find a CLI insurmountable and those able and willing to contribute to the kernel is pretty small.<br>

It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. I&#x27;m quite ok with keeping away contributors who are not willing to use a command line, but I think maybe asking everyone to learn to configure a MTA is a bit too much and probably adds nothing in terms of skills. Unless the project in question is a MTA :)<br>

Wow, such inclusiveness.<br>
<p>
In reality, it&#x27;s not just command line. You need to set up a whole parallel email infrastructure, because you can&#x27;t just send patches using Outlook or Gmail. And &quot;blessed&quot; email clients like mutt don&#x27;t support Exchange mailbox protocol. <br>
<p>
In my previous company I spent something like 3 days just setting up the email stuff to submit a kernel patch.<br>

Gmail does support it (I send patches through it). But with XOAUTH2 being a thing, app-specific passwords being sunset, and not knowing how msmtp and offlineimap are going to support it[1], that&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d expect to be true for too much longer. Though for those poor souls trying to send via the web interface, yeah, that&#x27;s a lost cause at this point and has been for at least a few years.<br>

[1] My $DAYJOB email is fine because I can register apps and make offlineimap work at least, but my personal account doesn&#x27;t seem to have the ability to register an application, so I&#x27;m probably stuck in the long term, but at least I have been migrating away for personal usage.<br>

That works if the app itself is registered, but since the app secret key is necessarily visible to me since I&#x27;d only really trust it if it were FOSS, that is destined to be revoked if/when the attention of the Eye of Sauron^WGoogle comes across it. OAuth is really good at locking out custom builds because now the service providers can deny arbitrary apps based on whatever whims they have that day. It is useful for blocking copycat spamware, but the knock-on effects for those of us who cobble together our setups is quite unfortunate :( .<br>

AFAIU, OAuth is supposed to add in a &quot;this app is authorized to use this service&quot; step to using the service through my account. This usually does come with real benefits:<br>
<p>
  - apps are limited in the API they access (and is curated by the developer rather than users not knowing what is actually necessary)<br>
  - additional permissions can be intercepted and requested at application update time (when refreshing their active token)<br>
  - dropping permissions doesn&#x27;t require users to go and do it manually<br>
  - if my account secret token is stolen from app A, app B can&#x27;t use it to access my account because it isn&#x27;t authorized to do so<br>
  - services can pinpoint misbehaving applications or use of deprecated APIs and contact application developers directly<br>
<p>
Of course, Fastmail&#x27;s application-specific passwords allow you to limit which service(s) are available, but since there&#x27;s no application authentication, stealing the password from offlineimap does grant IMAP access which is…substantial.<br>
<p>
Honestly, I think I&#x27;d be OK with service-specific passwords that can be authorized every N days through WebAuthn or some other hardware token mediated thing. Though this would mean my automated backups would require some more maintenance though since I&#x27;d need to go and touch a Yubikey or whatever to keep its authorization token alive.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Similarly, Drew DeVault has been working on the reverse direction, from a mailing list to a project forge, as well. Patchwork is a longstanding code-review project that also collects up patches from mailing lists to populate a web application. It would seem that much of the focus is on getting patches out of mailing lists, though, which is not where Ryabitsev is headed.</font><br>
<p>
A forge has more structured metadata and more information in general, so when trying to bridge the two approaches it&#x27;s of course more logical  to want the forge to be the primary and derive the more basic email format from the forge as opposed to the other way round. No surprise many people try this. I understand there are other, less technical considerations.<br>

That&#x27;s an understatement. Github&#x27;s preferred review model does not involve rewriting commits! In other words forget &quot;git range-diff&quot;. Review comments are shared as fixups instead and many projects don&#x27;t even squash them.<br>

Github is basically &quot;git as used by the creator of Fossil&quot; <br>

Gerrit is much closer to &quot;traditional&quot; git usage and gitlab is somewhere in between.<br>

And yes there is also the problem of vendor lock-in: good luck exporting code review metadata from github.<br>

I don&#x27;t know if Gerrit has changed since I last looked at it, but back then it didn&#x27;t support &quot;1 review, multiple patches&quot;. You&#x27;d either have to squash everything into one big patch which is obviously bad, or you&#x27;d have to tell all your colleagues to please review these patches in this order :/<br>

      But that's how it works in the email flow. What makes Gerrit awful (aside from the horribly busy UI) is that there's no concept of a connected patch series to review together. Having contributed to Chromium, that was the worst part of the experience. Refreshing patches or updating them based on review feedback was confusing and it was difficult to see whether anything I did was "correct".

Yeah, except the tooling now understands &quot;[PATCH vX Y/Z]&quot; prefixes and git send-email groups the patches by making them replies to the first in the series.<br>
<p>
At least on GitHub/GitLab the basic unit of review is a pull/merge request that may contain multiple commits. The drawback is of course that the submitter needs to do a &quot;scary&quot; force push to update the series.<br>

Gerrit has understood the notion of a dependent patch series for at least as long as I&#x27;ve been using it for real work (2015ish).<br>
<p>
I don&#x27;t believe there is the concept of a single atomic review for an entire patch series, as reviews are on a per-patch basis, with comments attached to specific code sections as well as independent comments on the commit message.  That&#x27;s all what one generally gets via &quot;traditional&quot; email review anyway.  That said, gerrit does provide mechansims for ensuring the entire series is applied/submitted in one go.<br>
<p>
Also, the Gerrit UI was considerably revamped (&quot;polygerrit&quot;) with the 3.0 release and has been continually refined since; I personally like it a lot better than than previous (&quot;GWT&quot;) UI.<br>

File/line information is available (certainly more easily than in email threads) via the API. We certainly extract out &quot;review evidence&quot; with ghostflow so that it can all be added to the merge commit from comments made on the PR (including from those reactions one can make). Yes, it&#x27;s in a different format, but at least it is structured, unlike email review feedback.<br>

That&#x27;s not Github&#x27;s preferred model, it&#x27;s the maintainer&#x27;s preferred model for the projects you encountered. I work on literally dozens of OSS projects on Github, and none of them do that. There&#x27;s nothing forcing anybody to do &quot;well-formatted chains of commits&quot; via email either, it&#x27;s just the maintainers (rightly) enforcing that via reviews. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the maintainers who are enforcing determinate styles. Of course forges could always make these workflows easier and better integrated - it&#x27;s not very obvious where to see diff-of-diffs on force pushes on Github and it wasn&#x27;t possible at all until recently, and commit-by-commit reviews interface used to be much worse with comments getting lost (but that&#x27;s no longer the case today).<br>

IME the key to a pull request process that works with outsider and drive-by contributions is automation.<br>
<p>
There *must* be automatic sanity checks for PRs, including that the change builds, that no new tests are broken, and in the case of the kernel likely that checkpatch is ok with it.<br>
<p>
There also needs to be automation (i.e. a bot) for prodding the PR opener to fix such issues (with pointers to clear contributor guides) and to close PRs that remain unfixed too long.<br>
<p>
Finally it needs to be easy for developers/maintainers to only see the PRs that are review/merge ready. And not just in the opinion of the contributor, but where all the checks pass.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; &quot;Please opt all subsystems I maintain out of this crap. The last thing I need is patches from people that can&#x27;t deal with a sane workflow.&quot; </font><br>
<p>
Ah yes, the very sane workflow which leads to 5% of all bugfixes being lost, and which cannot correlate a patch that has been merged to the one that was submitted. This isn&#x27;t really a matter of taste anymore; the kernel is missing important bugfixes because the current workflow allows patches to get lost on some mailing list way too easily, and heavily relies on people resubmitting patches they feel strongly about.<br>
<p>
Anyone who has ever tried tracking patches as new versions come in and get merged in various branches across subsystem trees knows how inconvenient it is compared to a pull request with feature branch based system.<br>

Yes, but there&#x27;s a difference between &quot;actually ignored&quot;, &quot;ignored a week after the Ack&quot;, and &quot;silently merged a week after the Ack&quot;. Being able to tell the difference between the last two is where my initial interest lies.<br>

It has a built-in mechanism to update a patch series (i.e. a branch) and to mark it as closed or merged. The latter can technically be done with patchwork from what I&#x27;ve heard, but I&#x27;ve never seen it done consistently. This would give you a view of what still hasn&#x27;t been looked at enough: open PRs with no reviews and nothing explicitly blocking their merge.<br>
<p>
Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not advocating for use of GitHub specifically, I&#x27;m pointing out how the current workflow&#x27;s lack of state tracking for patches is causing real problems, and forges are the only ones who have been innovating in this direction.<br>

I believe the common way to deal with patches getting lost is resend, if the submitter is still interested in getting it merged. And it might be better that way: if you found an old &quot;open&quot; PR and reviewed it but the submitter already lost the interest to follow it up, it would be a waste of time.<br>

I wonder if porting existing *GitGitGadget* (<a href="https://gitgitgadget.github.io/">https://gitgitgadget.github.io/</a>) GitHub app, that is used for specifically git.git development via GitHub Pull Requests, to be used for LKML and Linux kernel is feasible. Like the Linux kernel, Git itself does not accept code contributions via Pull Requests, but uses patch submission via git mailing list.<br>
<p>
There also is submitGit (<a href="https://submitgit.herokuapp.com/">https://submitgit.herokuapp.com/</a>), but I think nowadays GitGitGadget is the preferred tool.<br>

I hope github grows support for just like, dropping (or, god forbid, emailing) a textual patch file onto a repository to create a pull request, without having to go through the trouble of forking. This would be quite nice for package maintainers trying to get any patches upstream.<br>
<p>
On another note I read the headline as &quot;Github is moving their web framework into kernel space&quot; and had a double take! <br>

I just had a &quot;great&quot; idea: Why doesn&#x27;t the Linux Foundation provide a Docker container, which will contain a small email server that forwards your email to the &quot;real&quot; kernel mailing list, but before doing so will run all the checks and do all the formatting for you?<br>
<p>
So I can do &quot;git format-patch&quot;, send it to localhost:14121 (or wherever I launch the Docker instance), and then the Docker instance, upon receipt of the patch, will:<br>
 - Check the formatting,<br>
 - Check the &quot;CC&quot; list,<br>
 - Forward to lkml, etc.<br>
<p>
And if anything isn&#x27;t quite right, it just sends it right back to you and documents why and what needs changing, e.g. &quot;Hey, your patch touched subsystem X but you didn&#x27;t add X@so-and-so.org in the CC&quot;, and if you know what you&#x27;re doing, I suppose you could have some mechanism for passing &quot;flags&quot; to the server to override warnings...<br>
<p>
And then if you&#x27;re really paranoid, it could contain a mirror of the linux mailing list, and you could choose to &quot;emulate&quot; sending your patch, which would really just send it to this internal mirrored mailing list. That way you can convince yourself that it really does get sent the way you want and expect it to.<br>
<p>
Come to think of it, you could put a mini-webserver in it with all the clicky buttons anyone could want.<br>

Too crazy?<br>

FWIW, adding these kinds of things to ghostflow[1] seems like something within its wheelhouse. Willing to discuss if anyone is interested in implementing these actions (which can then be exposed through the `ghostflow-cli` tool). FWIW, format checking is already supported on a &quot;check the whole file&quot; level, but I suppose it can be checked if it conflicts with the diff to know if the modified lines need updated (rather than forcing the whole file to be formatted all the time; something not really feasible with the kernel).<br>

I see this mentioned in various places, then I get to the blockchain part of the webpage and remember why I end up closing the tab. It seems like an interesting project, but I feel like it has some of that &quot;add the blockchain and it gets better&quot; mentality. I&#x27;d really like some details as to what adding blockchain magic pixie dust would improve here for distributed hosting or software processes and why the alternatives to whatever it is doing aren&#x27;t sufficient.<br>

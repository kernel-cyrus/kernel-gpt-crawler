<h1>invalidate_page_range() for non-GPL modules</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted February 18, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
The kernel function <tt>invalidate_page_range()</tt> is not something which
has a lot of callers.  Its job is to invalidate all memory mappings which
cover a specific part of a file, presumably because the contents of the
relevant pages have changed on disk.  This function is currently exported
only to GPL-licensed modules.
<p>
Paul McKenney has <a href="/Articles/71714/">requested</a> that this
function be exported to all modules.  It seems that IBM's GPFS filesystem
needs it, and that filesystem is not free software.  The claim is that the
filesystem is an entirely independent development, and is thus not derived
from the kernel; it should not have to be licensed under the GPL to be
loadable into the kernel.
<p>
Andrew Morton <a href="/Articles/71715/">says</a> he is not opposed to the
patch.  One might think it would not be <i>too</i> controversial,
especially since that function was first created and <a
href="/Articles/31981/">submitted</a> by...Paul McKenney.  There are
developers, however, who believe that any module which is digging that
deeply into the virtual memory subsystem cannot help but be derived, in
some fashion, from the Linux kernel.  There is also, perhaps, a certain
desire to demonstrate that even IBM can't obtain arbitrary access to the
kernel for proprietary modules.
<p>
In general, the kernel hackers are more interested in seeing their work be
useful and used, instead of fighting over licensing battles.
So one might expect to
see this patch eventually get incorporated.  In more recent times, however,
some developers have been adopting a firmer position with regard to
proprietary modules.  This patch may still get in, but it's likely to have
a harder time than would have once been the case.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Andrew Morton later said
</p><blockquote>Needing access to invalidate_mmap_range() is surely not an indication of a
derived work.  It is an indication of a need for a reliable way to achieve
inter-node cache consistency.</blockquote>
<p>
I agree 100%.  I think any (viz non-GPL) filesystem implementation should be able notify the kernel that the underlying store has changed.

      &gt; One might think it would not be too controversial, <br>&gt; especially since that function was first created <br>&gt; and submitted by...Paul McKenney. <br> <br>It would seem to me, however, that the above is only one chapter of the story.  <br>His submission could be added to the kernel, and indeed use the REST of the <br>kernel, because it WAS GPLed.  What of the idea of &quot;standing on the <br>shoulders of giants&quot;? <br> <br>Who wrote the code that HIS patch called, or the code it was inserted in the <br>middle of and thus depends on?  Who wrote the code that THAT code <br>called?  Etc.. <br> <br>It seems to me that all the callees get veto power over this as well, at least in <br>theory.  At minimum, it would seem that the writer of the code directly called <br>by the patch or that the patch or segments of were introduced in the middle <br>of, have veto power.  How far beyond that we want to take it could be <br>debated, as could be what the default policy, should the author of supporting <br>code no longer be available or refuse to take a position. but it seems to me <br>that at minimum, should those authors express an opinion one way or the <br>other, it should be honored. <br> <br>(Personally, my position is that, would any of my work ever be involved.. <br>purely for argument's sake, since I'm not likely to ever do anything more than <br>trivial re the kernel.. I'd be inclined to say NO, since I wouldn't have <br>bothered switching from a decade on proprietary-ware if I didn't believe it <br>was the wrong solution, and I have strong feelings about ANYTHING I do <br>being supportive of proprietary-ware, PERIOD.  That's why tho I use <br>Mandrake, itself fairly strongly libre-ware supportive, I'm not a member of <br>Mdk Club -- a small portion of the dues of which must go to support in <br>SOME way the &quot;freebie&quot; proprietary-ware the club offers access to as one of <br>its benefits.  I don't want ANY support of mine going to proprietary-ware.  <br>However, as my code is NOT part of the dependency tree, here, it's not up to <br>me to decide whether GPL exceptions should be granted or not.) <br> <br>Duncan <br>

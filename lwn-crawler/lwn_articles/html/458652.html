<p>
A longstanding "flaw" (depending on who you talk to) in the Linux security
module (LSM) subsystem is the inability to stack LSMs.  That particular
problem came up for discussion at the Linux Security Summit (LSS), which
was held 
on September 8 in conjunction with the Linux Plumbers Conference.  The
participants were mostly in favor of stacking LSMs, the question
was how to get there.
</p>

<p>
Allowing administrators to enable more than one LSM at a time has been a <a
href="/Articles/368730/">recurring problem</a>.  Some would like to be able
to mix and match the protections offered by the different security
solutions, but that is not currently possible.  In addition, some
specialized security functionality has been proposed at various times, but
typically shunted toward an LSM-based solution.  Unfortunately, in most
distributions, the single LSM slot is already occupied by SELinux,
AppArmor, or some other LSM, so separate LSMs with extra protections are of
no use to many administrators.  Thus the interest in stacking
(or chaining) LSMs.

<p>
Ubuntu security team member Kees Cook and Smack developer Casey Schaufler
led the discussion, with Schaufler presenting a list of directions for LSM
that he jokingly described as "<q>suggestions that we've come up with
and think you should come up with too</q>".  The list covered five
items, but all were targeted at problems that stem from having multiple
concurrent (i.e. stacked) LSMs.
</p>

<a name="stacking"></a>
<h4>Stacking</h4>

<p>
David Howells <a href="/Articles/426921/">proposed</a> a possible solution
for stacking LSMs back in February, but it won't allow two mandatory access
control (MAC) LSMs (e.g. Smack and SELinux) to coexist.  Schaufler has
promised another, more 
general solution (which he calls "Glass"), but it still doesn't work for
all four LSMs (SELinux, Smack, TOMOYO, and AppArmor) at once, though
"<q>it's really close</q>".
</p>

<p>
There is a question of why users would want to combine the existing LSMs,
but Schaufler said that there are several combinations that people want to
try.  The two that are hardest to get working together (SELinux and Smack)
turn out to be the "<q>only uninteresting combination</q>", he said.
He has heard of users wanting to use Smack and AppArmor (or TOMOYO) at the
same time, as well as folks that want one thing that SELinux can do along
with something else that TOMOYO can do.
</p>

<p>
As Cook pointed out, though, another likely scenario is that administrators
will want to augment the distribution-provided security framework with
additional restrictions that could come from a specialized LSM.  Cook's <a
href="/Articles/393008/">Yama</a> is one such solution. It restricts
<tt>ptrace()</tt> and <a href="/Articles/390323/">symbolic links in
"sticky" directories</a> in ways that many are in favor of, though it has
not yet <a href="/Articles/398607/">made it into the mainline</a>.  For
that use-case, the idea would be to not have to lose the distribution's LSM
to add others like Yama.
</p>

<p>
Howells's patches could support fairly simple scenarios like SELinux (or
AppArmor) plus Yama, but Schaufler isn't convinced that restricting the
combinations is the right way forward.  There are, however, a bunch of
technical problems that will need to be solved in order to do arbitrary
stacking.  Some are fairly straightforward to handle, like how to share the
security context "blob" between multiple LSMs, but others are more difficult.
</p>

<p>
If there is a stack of LSMs, what happens when one LSM chooses
to deny access?  If the other LSMs in the stack are bypassed because of that
denial decision, they may get an incomplete picture of the accesses being
requested.  Howells's patch does short-circuit other LSMs that way, but at
the time it was proposed Schaufler was 
concerned about LSMs that collect statistical information on accesses that
would factor into subsequent access decisions.
</p>

<h4>Security IDs</h4>

<p>
But the biggest problem area is with Security IDs (<tt>secid</tt>s).  These
are 32-bit identifiers used by LSMs (currently only SELinux and Smack) to
identify security contexts when callbacks are made from other subsystems
(notably audit and networking) for access decisions.  But, if both are
active, the <tt>secid</tt> space needs to be shared somehow.  There are two
ways to do that, Schaufler said, "<q>one isn't good, the other is
painful</q>". Essentially, you could either split the <tt>secid</tt>
into two 16-bit pieces (the not good choice), one for each LSM (which, of course, opens the
question of what to do for three or more <tt>secid</tt>-using LSMs), or you
could set up some kind of mapping where each LSM had its own <tt>secid</tt>
space and those get mapped to a value in a shared space (the painful choice).
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, Schaufler advocates getting rid of the <tt>secid</tt>s
entirely and using security blob pointers everywhere.  There is at least one
major stumbling block to that plan, however, as getting a blob pointer into
the networking code will be somewhere between difficult and impossible.
Networking maintainer David Miller is adamantly opposed to putting such a
pointer into the <tt>sk_buff</tt> structure, and he NAKed that when it was
proposed earlier.  There are some lifecycle management and performance
issues that Miller is concerned about, according to Paul Moore.  In fact,
Moore is pretty confident that Miller hasn't changed his mind, as he
offered a "<q>case of your favorite scotch</q>" to anyone who could
convince Miller to add the pointer to <tt>sk_buff</tt>s.
</p>

<p>
According to Schaufler, LSM stacking is clearly needed, particularly in the
embedded space.  In addition, without the ability to stack LSMs, people are
becoming discouraged from writing new, more specialized LSMs.  While
Schaufler believes there are various access restrictions that can't be done
using the existing LSMs, the SELinux folks (Stephen Smalley in particular)
are not so sure.  That said, though, Smalley is not opposed to something
that would allow stacking Yama with SELinux (for example).  Rather than
trying to get a fully general stacking method into the mainline, Cook
suggested that a "<q>trimmed-down approach</q>", along the lines of
what Howells proposed, be tried instead.
</p>

<h4>Other multi-LSM wrinkles</h4>

<p>
There are other things that need to be worked out in any multi-LSM
scenario, including what to do about <tt>/proc/PID/attr/current</tt>.
According to Schaufler (with the agreement of AppArmor maintainer John
Johansen), the LSMs that came after SELinux made a mistake by reusing the
<tt>current</tt> file to contain information on the security context of the
process. Because stacking wasn't allowed, there was no real reason not to
reuse that file, but now it could cause problems.
</p>

<p>
One possibility is to include the name of the LSM in the path somewhere
(e.g. <tt>/proc/PID/attr/smack-current</tt>), but that isn't a complete
solution because existing user-space programs expect to find
<tt>current</tt>. Cook suggested that whichever LSM gets loaded first gets
<tt>current</tt> (in addition to its LSM-specific file).  Or "<q>out of
respect for our elders</q>", all LSMs could defer to SELinux for
<tt>current</tt>, Schaufler said. 
</p>

<p>
That leads to a related problem: determining which LSM is active (or LSMs
are active in a multi-LSM world).  Currently, each LSM has its own <i>ad
hoc</i> method for user space to figure out whether it is running.  Adding
a <tt>/sys/kernel/security/lsm</tt> file with the names of any active LSMs
in it would help.  Any LSM that is "<q>actively enforcing policy</q>"
(e.g. not SELinux in permissive or disabled modes) would add itself in the
order in which the LSM was loaded.
</p>

<p>
Another related problem is the lack of consistency in
<tt>/sys/kernel/security</tt> that led to the suggestion of an "LSMKit"
(which was greeted with laughter when Cook jokingly suggested it).  There
are a number of tools that display security context information
(e.g. <tt>ls&nbsp;-Z</tt>) that will be confused in a multi-LSM world.
Creating a library that would enumerate the active LSMs and gather up the
relevant context information would simplify those tools, as well as
providing some consistency of the kind of information that gets presented.
Those gathered at the summit seemed favorably disposed toward that idea,
though it is unclear if anyone will actually have the time to work on it.
</p>

<p>
Schaufler noted that the general agreement about the need for LSM stacking
was new. It is "<q>the first time no one has stood up and said 'This is
an abomination'</q>", he said.  But, Smalley said that didn't mean that
he thinks it's a good idea either.  Basically, he said that
"<q>arbitrary composition [of security modules] is known to be a bad
thing</q>", but that he recognizes some will still want to be able to do
it.  As long as full-fledged security frameworks like SELinux and AppArmor
can live in "<q>their own separate worlds</q>", he is not opposed to
having some way to compose LSMs.

<p>
But, Smalley still thinks that there could be a single LSM that is used by
everyone.  Getting there is a matter of understanding all of the
requirements that are being solved by various LSMs and incorporating them
all into one.  Schaufler is skeptical of that approach, and believes that
it is "<q>beyond us technologically</q>" to fully understand all of
the requirements that are or will be needed.  Good solutions tend to come
along periodically, he said, and we should have ways to accommodate them.
</p>

<h4>Wrapping up</h4>

<p>
Debian currently only compiles one LSM (SELinux) into its kernel due to
the memory 
that gets wasted by the unused code for inactive LSMs.  Cook brought this
issue up because he would like to see Debian kernels build in more LSMs and
allow users to choose which to activate at boot time.  It is a
"<q>tiny</q>" 
amount of memory, according to Cook, but Debian is unwilling to add any
more LSMs until there is some way to recover the lost memory.
</p>

<p>
At first, there was concern that the idea was to return to the days where
LSMs were actually kernel modules that could loaded and unloaded (which
caused innumerable problems when the active LSM was unloaded).  But Cook
said all that was really needed was a way to unload all but the active
LSM.  As long as this unloading mechanism didn't
touch the active LSM, and that the feature itself was optional, no one seemed
to object to it.  So it is mostly just a matter of someone finding the
time to write the code.
</p>

<p>
The fate of Yama was the last thing discussed in the LSM roundtable.  The
protections that it offers are valuable; several people in the room
said they would enable it if it were in the mainline (and the stacking
problem were solved).  But, seemingly, no matter how Cook structures the
code (in the core or as an LSM), it gets NAKed, partly because it does not
represent a coherent security framework as the existing LSMs do.
</p>

<p>
Part of the concern is that LSMs would become a "dumping ground" for
various security fixes/enhancements that are not deemed acceptable for core
kernel code.  Smalley wanted to ensure that there was not a proliferation
of small, specialized LSMs and would instead like to see Yama become the
LSM for discretionary access control (DAC) enhancements.  Any other
proposals for those kinds of changes could be pushed toward Yama, rather
than creating a whole new LSM.
</p>

<p>
That idea seemed to gain some traction but, unless Yama gets into the
mainline, it's a moot point.  There was some discussion of Christoph
Hellwig's NAK that kept Yama out the last time it came up.  Smalley and
others are not really convinced that his NAK is valid unless Yama touches
VFS internals (which it doesn't).  Cook pointed out that the
<tt>ptrace()</tt> restrictions can't be done with any of the existing LSMs
and that the symlink restrictions are "<q>provably correct</q>", but
there is no path into the kernel that he's found.  At this point, the plan
seems to be to propose Yama again, perhaps as the "enhanced DAC" LSM, and
to try to overcome any NAKs by better explaining the benefits Yama
provides.  The clear sense was that a more concerted effort would be made
to get Yama into the mainline in the near future.

While reading this I kept seeing parallels to the problem of combining monads in haskell. Simple stacking won't do; the current solution of monad transformers essentially requires each possible combination of monads to be coded up separately. While that's a combinatorial explosion, luckily haskell only has 4 or 5 commonly used monads so it's manageable.<br>
<p>
Anyway, that's way out there and advanced mathematics will probably not come to the kernel's rescue the way it often comes to haskell's, but I thought it was an interesting way of looking at this.<br>

Yeah.<br>
<p>
How about this: if AppArmor work is finished before Wheeze release, then I'll send you a case of beer. Alternatively, I'll buy you a year of "maniacal supporter" subscription for LWN.<br>

Perhaps an incremental approach to stacking would make it happen sooner: pick a set of features that make stacking hard (eg 32-bit security ids) and define any lsm which does not use those features as "lightweight". Then allow stacking of any number or lightweight modules and zero or one heavyweight module. Hopefully that would allow Yama to be stacked. Over time add difficult features to expand the definition of lightweight until more modules can be stacked.<br>

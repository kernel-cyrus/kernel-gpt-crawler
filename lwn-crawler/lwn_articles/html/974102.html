<p>
David Vernet kicked off the BPF track at 2024's BPF track at the
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>
with a
talk about polymorphic kfuncs — or, with less jargon, kernel functions that can
be called from BPF which use different implementations depending on context.
He explained how this would be useful to
the <a href="/Articles/972710/">sched_ext</a> BPF scheduling framework,
but expected it to be helpful in
other areas as well.
</p>

<p>
Alexei Starovoitov gave a talk later in the conference about the history of BPF,
including
<a href="/Articles/856005/">
the origin</a> and motivation for kfuncs — stay tuned for an article on
that. For now, knowing more about kfuncs is not really needed
to understand Vernet's problem and proposed solution.
</p>

<p>
There are 151 kfuncs in the kernel as of version 6.9, so it should probably not be
too surprising that they vary wildly. Some kfuncs, Vernet pointed out, are
used for extremely common, basic functionality
— such as the functions for acquiring and releasing locks. These
kfuncs have the same meaning and implementation in every possible context,
because what they do is fairly simple.
Other kfuncs, however, can have context-specific semantics. Some may only have
"any meaning at all [...] within specific contexts", Vernet said.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/974117"><img

title="David Vernet" class="rthumb" width=500 height=743></a>

<p>
One example of this is the functions for manipulating dispatch queues — structures
used in sched_ext to store lists of pending tasks. Vernet called them the basic
building blocks of scheduler policy. One of the main functions for manipulating
them from BPF, <tt>scx_bpf_dispatch()</tt>, always has the same meaning: adding a
task to a different queue. But when called from different BPF callbacks, there
are subtle variations in how the function can be used.
</p>

<p>
When called from a <tt>select_cpu()</tt> or <tt>enqueue()</tt> callback,
<tt>scx_bpf_dispatch()</tt> cannot drop the run-queue lock relevant to the task,
and can only dispatch tasks to the CPU that triggered the call.
Furthermore, only tasks that are
being woken or enqueued can be dispatched.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, when called from a <tt>dispatch()</tt> callback,
<tt>scx_bpf_dispatch()</tt> is free to drop the run-queue lock, dispatch to any
CPU, and dispatch multiple tasks. The difference is that <tt>dispatch()</tt>
is called by a CPU that is about to otherwise go idle, and so there is no
existing work on the CPU that needs to be carefully worked around.
</p>

<p>
In both cases, <tt>scx_bpf_dispatch()</tt> presents the same logical API, but
the differing constraints mean that the implementation in these two cases is
quite different. Right now, the code tracks which case it is in with a per-CPU
variable, and then uses that to choose which implementation to use. "So you can
work around it," Vernet admitted, but he wanted to see if the implementation
could be better.
</p>

<h4>Vernet's proposal</h4>

<p>
Right now, every kfunc is associated with a
<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/btf.html">
BPF Type Format</a> (BTF) ID. This is an
ID used to represent the kfunc in the debugging information for the BPF program,
but it is also used with the BPF instruction that calls a kfunc to indicate
which one it wants to invoke. When the BPF program is
loaded and then just-in-time compiled, the BTF IDs get resolved, and the
resulting code can call them directly.
</p>

<p>
Vernet suggests extending this mechanism by having the BPF verifier support multiple
kfuncs with the same ID — whenever it encounters a call to a kfunc, it would ask
the subsystem associated with that kfunc ID what the real kfunc should be (using
a new callback). The
subsystem would then reply with a "concrete" kfunc ID, and loading would proceed
in the same way. This approach moves the tracking of the context of a call from
run-time to load-time, and eliminates the need for tracking the state in a
per-CPU variable.
</p>

<p>
Vernet said that the advantage of this approach is the ergonomic API it
presents, and the control it gives subsystems over how their kfuncs can be
called. But the approach does have its drawbacks. For one thing, adding
additional callbacks in the verifier threatens to make one of the most
complicated parts of BPF even more so. For another, it would use load-time logic
for what is really a static configuration — if the compiler understood the
different contexts that the kfuncs care about, the correct kfunc implementation
could be chosen at build-time.
</p>

<p>
A build-time configuration would be nicer, Vernet stated, but it would be "kind
of a pain in the neck to implement". He suggested that implementing it
statically was probably not a high priority. Vernet did think any mechanism for
polymorphic kfuncs would probably be useful to areas of the kernel other than sched_ext.
</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>
The other attendees had questions about Vernet's proposal. One member of the
audience pointed out that there is already a similar mechanism for BPF helper
functions (a <em>different</em> kind of kernel function callable from BPF
programs, with a different interface), and asked that Vernet "look at this more
holistically".
Vernet replied that the equivalent aspect of helper functions lets the
implementations differ depending on the BPF program type
— so the same helper function can be implemented
differently for a BPF program attached to a trace point or registered as a
callback. But that approach won't work for his use case, because the program
types in question are not sufficiently granular. As far as the verifier
is concerned, all of the callbacks involved in sched_ext are of the same type,
because they are all <tt>struct_ops</tt> programs (a mechanism where different parts of
the kernel can define a struct full of function pointers to which BPF programs
can be attached). He wants to be able to handle calls
from different <tt>struct_ops</tt> programs differently — which almost certainly requires
information the verifier doesn't have,
since it is the other subsystems or modules which
define <tt>struct_ops</tt> callbacks that would know which functions should be handled
differently.
</p>

<p>
The discussion went back and forth a little bit, with the other attendee trying
to identify ways that the mechanism could be generalized beyond <tt>struct_ops</tt>
programs. Vernet agreed that "if
we can abstract it that would be much better for sure," but didn't seem to think
that the existing helper mechanism was a suitable basis for that.
</p>

<p>
Another member of the audience asked whether it would be possible to have kfuncs
that behave differently based on the type of their arguments. The motivating
use case would be to enable different data types being inserted into a BPF map to
be handled differently. "I want to skip the ownership check when the argument is
an <tt>sk_buf</tt>", they explained. Vernet agreed that this would be
technically feasible, since the verifier knows the types of the arguments to the
kfunc. The question, in Vernet's eyes, is whether this mechanism would be confusing.
</p>

<p>
The first participant in the conversation
suggested that this use case could be served just by adding
new kfuncs and letting the developer use the right one. The second commenter
pushed back, saying that they did not want to introduce many new kfuncs for what
is effectively the same behavior — especially not when it seems likely that
there will be more types that need special handling to keep in maps in the future.
Vernet agreed that it makes sense to give kfuncs the flexibility to decide what
they want to do.
</p>

<p>
That was the end of the discussion at the time, so it remains to be seen whether the
proposal will be adopted, and if so in what form.

<p>
The existing mechanism is indeed not suitable in its current form given that it only distinguishes between different BPF program types as opposed to different instances of BPF programs (for example, all tracepoint progs invoke a helper in the same way, as opposed to individual tracepoints being able to specify different semantics), but I'm OK with the plan being to extend the existing helper mechanism to allow different BPF prog instances of the same type being able to specify different helper/kfunc semantics. IIRC, I think we had rough consensus around that being the plan.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 26, 2023</br>
           </div>
The BPF subsystem exposes many aspects of the kernel's internal algorithms
and data structures; this naturally leads to concerns about maintaining
interface stability as the kernel changes.  The longstanding position that
BPF offers no interface-stability guarantees to user space has always
seemed a little questionable; kernel developers have, in the past, found
themselves having to maintain interfaces that were not intended to be
stable.  Now the BPF community is starting to think about what it might
mean to provide explicit stability promises for at least some of its
interfaces.
<p>
<h4>Hooks, helpers, and kfuncs</h4>
<p>
BPF allows programs loaded by user space to be attached to any of a large
number of hooks and run within the kernel — after the
subsystem's verifier concludes that those programs cannot harm the system.
A program will gain access to the kernel data structures provided to it by
the hook it is attached to.  In some cases, the program can modify that
data directly, thus directly affecting the operation of the kernel; in
others, the kernel will act on the value returned by a BPF program to, for
example, allow or disallow an operation.
<p>
There are also two mechanisms by which the kernel can make additional
functionality available to BPF programs.  <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">Helper
functions</a> (or "helpers") are special
functions that are written for the purpose of being provided to BPF
programs; they have been present since the beginning of the
extended-BPF era.  The mechanism known as <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/kfuncs.html">kfuncs</a> is
newer; it allows
<i>any</i> kernel function to be made available to BPF, possibly with some
restrictions applied.  Kfuncs are simpler and more flexible; had they been
implemented first, it seems unlikely that anybody would have added helpers
later.  That said, kfuncs have a significant limitation that they are only
accessible to JIT-compiled BPF code, so they are unavailable on
architectures lacking JIT support (a list that currently includes 32-bit
Arm and RISC-V, though patches adding that support for both are in the
works). 
<p>
Kfuncs are easily added and generally see little review outside of the
small core-BPF community.  Most kfuncs in existing kernels reach deeply
into the networking subsystem, providing access for <a
href="/Articles/811631/">congestion-control algorithms</a>, the <a
href="/Articles/750845/">express data path (XDP)</a>, and more.  But there are
also kfuncs for access to the core <tt>task_struct</tt> structure, <a
href="/Articles/901284/">crashing the kernel</a>, access to control groups,
read-copy-update, kernel linked lists, and more.  The list of kfuncs seems
to grow with each kernel release.
<p>
Each kfunc makes some useful functionality available to BPF programs, but
almost every one also exposes some aspect of how the kernel works
internally.  One cannot, for example, implement a congestion-control
algorithm in BPF 
without significant visibility into how the networking subsystem works and
the ability to affect that operation.  That is (usually) fine until the
kernel changes — which happens frequently.  Within the kernel, API changes
are a routine occurrence; developers simply fix all of the affected kernel
code as needed.  But those developers are unable to fix BPF code that may
be widely deployed on production systems.  Any changes to kernel code that
has BPF hooks in it risks breaking an unknown amount of user-space code
using those hooks.
<p>
The normal rule in the kernel community is that changes cannot break user
space; if a patch is found to have broken programs in actual use, that
change will normally be reverted.  User-space APIs are thus a significant
constraint on kernel development; in the worst case, they could block
needed changes entirely.  That is a prospect that makes kernel developers
nervous about providing BPF access to their subsystems.
<p>
The intersection of BPF and interface stability has come up numerous times
on the mailing lists and at conferences.  The BPF community's position has
always been clear: the interfaces used by BPF programs are analogous to
those used by loadable kernel modules.  They are thus a part of the
internal kernel API rather than the user-space API and have no stability
guarantees.  If a kernel change breaks a BPF program, it is the BPF program
that will have to adapt.
<p>
It is a convenient position, but it's never been entirely clear that this
position is tenable in the long term.  If a kernel change breaks a BPF
program that is widely used, there will be substantial pressure to revert
that change, regardless of what the official position is.  Consider, for
example, <a href="/Articles/909109/">a human-interface-device (HID) driver</a>
implemented in BPF.  If this mechanism is successful, distributions will
eventually ship BPF HID drivers, and users will likely not even know that
they are using a BPF program.  They are unlikely to be amused if, in
response to a future kernel update that breaks their mouse, they are told
that it is their fault for using internal kernel APIs.
<p>
Beyond that, a lack of interface stability guarantees may well be an
impediment to the future adoption of BPF by developers.  It may come as a
surprise to learn that developers tend not to be happy if they have to deal
with bug reports because an interface they used was changed.  There will be
a strong incentive to avoid an API that is presented as being unstable,
even if that API could be the path to a better solution for their problem.
<p>
<h4>Documenting BPF interface stability</h4>
<p>
The BPF developers, it seems, have been talking about these problems; one
tangible result from those discussions was <a
href="/ml/bpf/20230117212731.442859-1-toke@redhat.com/">this documentation
patch</a> recently posted by Toke Høiland-Jørgensen that described how a
(partial) stability guarantee could work:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	This patch adds a description of the (new) concept of "stable
	kfuncs", which are kfuncs that offer a "more stable" interface than
	what we have now, but is still not part of [the kernel's user-space
	API].
<p>
	This is mostly meant as a straw man proposal to focus discussions
	around stability guarantees. From the discussion, it seemed clear
	that there were at least some people (myself included) who felt
	that there needs to be some way to export functionality that we
	consider "stable" (in the sense of "applications can rely on its
	continuing existence").
</blockquote>
<p>
There are, he said in the cover letter, a couple of approaches that could
be taken.  One would be to declare that helper functions are a stable
interface, and that kfuncs are not.  Should a kfunc prove to be
sufficiently useful that developers feel the need for a stability
guarantee, the kfunc could be promoted to a helper.  Alexei Starovoitov <a
href="/ml/bpf/20230119043247.tktxsztjcr3ckbby@MacBook-Pro-6.local/">objected</a>
to that idea, noting that the promotion would, itself, be an ABI break:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Say, we convert a kfunc to helper. Immediately the existing bpf
	prog that uses that kfunc will fail to load. That's the opposite of
	stability.  We're going to require the developer to demonstrate the
	real world use of kfunc before promoting to stable, but with such
	'promotion' we will break bpf progs.
</blockquote>
<p>
An alternative described by Høiland-Jørgensen is to explicitly mark kfuncs
that are meant to be stable.  All kfuncs now must be declared to the kernel
with the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/kfuncs.html#annotating-kfuncs"><tt>BTF_ID_FLAGS()</tt>
macro</a>, which takes a number of flags modifying that kfunc's treatment
by the BPF subsystem.  <tt>KF_ACQUIRE</tt>, for example, says that the
function will return a pointer to a reference-counted object that must be
released elsewhere in the program, while <tt>KF_SLEEPABLE</tt> says that
the kfunc might sleep.  A new flag, <tt>KF_STABLE</tt>, would be used to
mark kfuncs that the kernel developers will go out of their way not to
break.
<p>
Even then, though, the document makes it clear that a <tt>KF_STABLE</tt>
kfunc still lacks the same level of guarantee as the rest of the user-space
ABI: "<q>Should a stable kfunc turn out to be no longer useful, the BPF
community may decide to eventually remove it</q>".  That removal would be
preceded by a period in which the kfunc would be marked as being deprecated
(with the new <tt>KF_DEPRECATED</tt> flag) that would generate a warning
whenever a BPF program used it.
<p>
Starovoitov (in the above-linked message) was fairly negative about this
proposal.  All kfuncs should be treated as if they were stable, he said,
with the amount of effort that is justified in maintaining stability
increasing as the use of the kfunc goes up.  A strong stability guarantee
would require an active developer community that is clearly making use of
the kfunc:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The longer the kfunc is present the harder it will be for
	maintainers to justify removing it. The developers have to stick
	around and demonstrate that their kfunc is actually being used. The
	better developers do it the bigger the effort maintainers will put
	into keeping the kfunc perfectly intact.
</blockquote>
<p>
He also made the point that there are currently no kfuncs in the kernel
that would merit the stable marking, because nobody has done any research
into which kfuncs are actually in production use.  Similarly, there are
currently no deprecated kfuncs.  Thus, he said: "<q>Introducing KF_STABLE
and KF_DEPRECATED right now looks premature</q>".  Høiland-Jørgensen <a
href="/ml/bpf/875ycvo1im.fsf@toke.dk/">responded</a> that, at a minimum,
the development community should promise not to remove any kfuncs without
implementing a deprecation period first.
<p>
David Vernet <a href="/ml/bpf/Y8gV%2FXveyPmf8alQ@maniforge.lan/">was also
unconvinced</a> about the proposal.  It would be better, he said, to put
information about stability and deprecation into the kernel documentation
rather than in the code.  He also worried that <tt>KF_STABLE</tt> lacked
the ability to express the types of changes that might come, and suggested
that some sort of symbol-versioning mechanism might be better.
<p>
One aspect of the problem that was <i>not</i> touched on in the discussion
was the fact that, as BPF reaches into more kernel subsystems, maintaining
stability will require the cooperation of developers outside of the BPF
community — developers who may never have signed onto any stability
guarantee.  If, for 
example, a future <tt>task_struct</tt> change ends up being blocked because
it breaks some BPF program, the resulting fireworks would likely require a
lot of popcorn to get through.  To be truly effective, any promise of
stability for kfuncs is probably going to require a wider discussion than
has been seen so far.
<p>
For all of these reasons, it seems unlikely that the scheme described in
Høiland-Jørgensen's patch will be adopted in that form.  Instead, the
stability status of kfuncs may remain somewhat ambiguous, Starovoitov's
statement that "<q>we need to finish it now and don't come back to it again
every now and then</q>" notwithstanding.  Stability guarantees are not
something to be made 
lightly, so it is not surprising that the BPF community still seems to not
want to rush into doing any such thing.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Agreed this would be a really bad situation, but I don't think that's the intended direction. To quote Alexei from [0]:<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;The kernel is huge and core infra changes all the time.</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;bpf apis must never be a reason not to change something in the kernel.</span><br>
<p>
[0]: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20230119043247.tktxsztjcr3ckbby@MacBook-Pro-6.local/">https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20230119043247.tktxsztjcr3ckb...</a><br>
<p>
I read that as the official policy for BPF, including kfuncs, being: "we will never outright tie the kernel's hands". The goal of this exchange is really just to make expectations concrete, not to impose any new stability requirements on the kernel. I think this quote (again from Alexei) also provides some useful context:<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;The bpf developers adding new kfunc should assume that it's stable and proceed</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;to use it in bpf progs and production applications.</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;The bpf maintainers will keep this stability promise. They obviously will not</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;reap it out of the kernel on the whim, but they will nuke it if this kfunc</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;will be in the way of the kernel innovation.</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;The longer the kfunc is present the harder it will be for maintainers to justify</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;removing it. The developers have to stick around and demonstrate that their</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;kfunc is actually being used. The better developers do it the bigger the effort</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;maintainers will put into keeping the kfunc perfectly intact.</span><br>
<p>
I think this philosophy arguably applies to any kernel &lt;-&gt; kernel API. If a maintainer wants to, they're free to e.g. change something that requires updating 200 upstreamed modules or other compilation units, and maybe even requires removing some features that others in the kernel are actively using (as long as they're not UAPI bound). However, like any other change, such actions require reasonable justification, and they're probably unlikely to want to remove something that a lot of people are using precisely because it changes the cost calculus.<br>
<p>
All of this applies to kfuncs -- at the end of the day, there's no hard stability guarantees, but given the basic expectation that any change requires justification, a maintainer should hopefully have a good reason for changing or ripping out a kfunc if a lot of people are finding it useful.<br>
<p>
Probably worth highlighting as well (from earlier in the article):<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;If this mechanism is successful, distributions will eventually ship BPF HID drivers, and users will likely not even know that they are using a BPF</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;program. They are unlikely to be amused if, in response to a future kernel update that breaks their mouse, they are told that it is their fault for using</span><br>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;internal kernel APIs.</span><br>
<p>
This is true of kernel modules as well, and hopefully is something that the distribution would address when they upgraded the kernel. Ideally, we can improve the situation here by upstreaming more BPF programs, though in general the situation is actually arguably quite a bit better for BPF programs than for modules, thanks to CO-RE ([1]).<br>

Maybe what is really needed here is an unstable or experimental annotation rather than a stable one?<br>
<p>
A way for developers to experiment with a new kfunc while signalling to others that this is still an API that is subject to frequent change because the right API has not finished their design phase yet similar to e.g. Rust's unstable feature mechanism.<br>

Maybe any stable kfunc should have to use a wrapper (which the compiler could optimize out at build time), such that changing any of the existing kernel functions leads to the wrapper failing to compile (in the same way as other uses of the kernel function) rather than a kernel which compiles but breaks any BPF programs that uses that kfunc.<br>
<p>
In order for the kernel to have a function in a stable ABI, it should be necessary to duplicate the current function declaration at some particular time as the stable function declaration, so that changes to the code of some subsystem can't affect what's declared as the stable ABI. You need both "here's what we're promising" and "here's what we're providing" separately, despite the fact that they're the same, so that if they're ever not the same you can detect the issue.<br>
<p>
I think it may also be valuable in stabilizing kfuncs if the wrapper could declare that the kfunc it's providing has the name of the kernel function it's wrapping, rather than the name of the wrapper. That would avoid the issue that, for any kfunc that's using an existing kernel function, you're essentially promising to break any existing programs that use it if you make the kfunc stable.<br>

I realize it is a bit of bikesheading, but perhaps calling the interface consistent rather than stable will help suggest the behavior has expectations of behavior without the connotation of the stable kernel interfaces?<br>

What exactly you call it doesn't really change the fundamental dynamic behind "never break userspace": If a user upgrades and it breaks their system, they will never upgrade voluntarily again. You can only have a healthy development community when you're all working on the same thing (i.e. close to upstream). So this is not just an abstract problem about broken promises that you could solve with naming. If BPF is regularly causing people to not upgrade their kernels, that has the potential to be an active threat to the future of Linux.<br>

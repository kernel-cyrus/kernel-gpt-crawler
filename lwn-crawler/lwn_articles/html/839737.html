           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 11, 2020</br>
           </div>
Kernel development is a constant exercise in reducing overhead; any
resources taken by the kernel are not available for the workload that users
actually want to run.  As part of this, the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.13/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L29"><tt>page</tt>
structure</a> used to manage memory has been kept as small as possible.
Even so, <tt>page</tt> structures typically take up just over 1.5% of the
available memory, which is too much for some users.  LWN recently <a
href="/Articles/839216/">looked at DMEMFS</a> as one approach to reduce
this overhead, but that is not the only work happening in this area.  Two
developers are currently working independently on patches to reduce the
overhead associated with huge pages in particular.
<p>
<h4>Memory maps and tail pages</h4>
<p>
The aforementioned <tt>page</tt> structure holds most of what the kernel
knows about every page of memory in the system: how it is used, its
position on various lists, the location of its backing store, etc.  There
is, thus, one <tt>page</tt> structure for each physical page in the system;
in common configurations, that means one 64-byte structure for every
4096-byte page.
<p>
In the early days of Linux, the kernel would allocate a simple array of
<tt>page</tt> structures that was just large enough to represent the memory
installed in 
the system; that worked because physical memory itself looked like a simple
array of pages.  Since then, though, life has become rather more complex
for the memory-management subsystem.  Nodes in NUMA systems have distinct
ranges of memory with, possibly, large gaps between them.  Memory can be
plugged into a system (or removed from it) at run time.  Virtualized guests
can have memory injected into them (or removed) while they run as well.  As
a result, the simple, linear model of memory no longer works.
<p>

The kernel has used a few different models for the memory map over time;
see <a href="/Articles/789304/">this article</a> for the full history.  The
preferred model in current times (for 64-bit systems) is called
"sparsemem-vmemmap"; it uses the system's memory-management unit (MMU) to
restore 
the illusion of a simple, linear map (called the "vmemmap").  Specifically,
each architecture 
reserves a portion of the kernel address space for this map; the
x86-64 architecture, for example, puts it at <tt>0xffffea0000000000</tt>
when four-level page tables are in use.  Whenever memory is added to the
system (including memory "added" when the kernel discovers it at boot
time), a suitable number of <tt>page</tt> structures is allocated and the
set is mapped into the vmemmap.  Discontiguous chunks of memory can thus
be made to appear to be contiguous, simplifying a number
of low-level management functions.
<p>
The end result looks vaguely like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2020/vmemmap1.svg" alt="[vmemmap]" class="photo"
 width=450>
</blockquote>
<p>
On a system with 4096-byte pages and a 64-byte <tt>struct page</tt>, one
page of memory will need to be allocated and mapped into the vmemmap array
for every 64 <tt>page</tt> structures.  Once that is done, the 
<tt>page</tt> structure for any given page can be found by using its
page-frame number as an offset from <tt>vmemmap_base</tt> (on x86
systems).
<p>
<a href="/Articles/619514/">Compound pages</a> complicate the situation.  A
compound page is formed when a group of adjacent pages is grouped together
into a larger unit.  The most common use is for huge pages â€” larger page
sizes implemented by the system's CPU and MMU.  The x86-64 architecture,
for example, implements 2MB and 1GB huge pages; there can be significant
performance benefits from using them.  Whenever a huge page is created from
a set of single ("base") pages, the associated <tt>page</tt> structures are
changed to reflect the compound page that they now represent.
<p>
The first base page in a compound page is called the "head" page, while all
of the others are called "tail" pages.  A 2MB huge page is thus made up of
one head page and 511 tail pages.  The <tt>page</tt> structure for the head
page is marked as a compound page, and represents the whole set.  The
<tt>page</tt> structures for the tail pages, instead, contain only a
pointer to the head page.  (That is not quite true; the first couple tail
pages have some metadata about the compound page, but that can be ignored
here).
<p>
Thus, of the 512 <tt>page</tt> structures associated with a 2MB huge page,
511 are essentially identical copies of a sign saying "look over there
instead".  Those structures take up eight pages of memory in their own
right, seven of which represent only tail pages and contain identical data.
<p>
<h4>Trimming wasted <tt>page</tt> structures</h4>
<p>
Both patch sets described here take the same approach to saving memory.
The first out the gate was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201210035526.38938-1-songmuchun@bytedance.com/">this
set from Muchun Song</a>, currently in its eighth revision.  Song realized
that there was no compelling reason to keep all of those pages full of
identical <tt>page</tt> structures around, especially given the virtual
mapping already used by the vmemmap mechanism.  Consider a more compact
version of the diagram above:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2020/vmemmap2.svg" alt="[tail pages]" class="photo"
width=500>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, one 2MB huge page is represented by those eight pages of
<tt>page</tt> structures, almost all of which correspond to tail pages and
just point to the structure for the head page.
<p>
In a kernel with Song's patch set applied, that structure is changed.
Since seven of those eight pages all contain identical pages, they can be
replaced with a single page instead; that one page can be mapped seven
times to fill out the vmemmap array as before:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2020/vmemmap3.svg" alt="[shared tail pages]" class="photo"
width=500>
</blockquote>
<p>
As far as the rest of the kernel is concerned, nothing has changed; the
<tt>page</tt> structure for any given tail page looks the way it did
before.  But six pages of duplicated data can now be given back to the
system for other uses for as long as the compound page continues to exist.
In other words, 75% of the memory overhead for this compound page has just
been eliminated.
<p>
The savings for 1GB huge pages are even more dramatic;
4094 of the 4096 pages representing tail pages can be eliminated.
General-purpose systems tend not to use many 1GB huge pages, but there are
situations, including some virtualization workloads, where they are useful.
It's not surprising that the prospect of saving nearly 16MB of overhead for
each 1GB huge page is attractive to hosting providers.
<p>
Huge pages do not necessarily remain huge forever; they can be returned to
the kernel or split up for a number of reasons.  When that happens, the
full set of <tt>page</tt> structures must be restored.  In Song's patch
set, this work is deferred to a workqueue so that the necessary pages can
be allocated in a relatively relaxed setting.  This work adds some
compute-time overhead to both the allocation and freeing of huge pages;
Song included a set of benchmark results and concluded that this overhead
is "<q>not significant</q>".  There is also overhead added because
the patch set disables the use of huge pages for the vmemmap itself; that
will evidently be rectified if and when the core patch set is accepted.
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20201208172901.17384-1-joao.m.martins@oracle.com/">alternative
patch set</a> is from Joao Martins.  It implements the same idea,
eliminating most of the pages containing <tt>page</tt> structures for tail
pages.  While Song's patch set is focused on main memory, though, Martins's
work is specifically for nonvolatile RAM.  This memory is always brought
online as a separate operation, so there is no need to free existing pages
out of the vmemmap; instead, new devices are brought online formatted as
huge pages from the beginning.  That simplifies the code by eliminating all
of the logic to change the vmemmap on the fly, but at the cost of reducing
the applicability of the technique.
<p>
One incidental advantage of treating nonvolatile RAM this way, though, is
that it eliminates the need to initialize large numbers of <tt>page</tt>
structures when a new memory array is attached.  That speeds the process of
making that memory available to the system considerably.  Use of huge pages
also significantly accelerates the task of mapping this memory into kernel
space, an operation that happens frequently when the DAX direct-access
subsystem is in use.
<p>
Both patch sets appear to have advantages and disadvantages.  The problem
at this point is that the memory-management developers are highly unlikely
to be interested in merging both of them.  So either one will have to be
chosen over the other, or the two patch sets will need to be somehow
combined into one that meets everybody's needs.  That sort of
reconciliation can take time; the process of merging low-level
memory-management trickery is not the fastest either.  So this work is
probably not arriving anytime in the near future, but in the longer term it
may well lead to a lot of memory saved on Linux systems.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Does the memory for the &quot;struct page&quot;-filled pages have any specific constraints that make its allocation difficult, beyond needing to sit on the correct NUMA node?<br>
<p>
If it doesn&#x27;t, it seems trivial to allocate these structure pages directly from the set of &quot;returned&quot; pages whenever a huge page is returned. If I&#x27;m not missing anything (which I may well be), this should obviate the need for a delayed allocation in this scenario.<br>

I&#x27;m probably talking from a position of complete ignorance, but it just struck me - doesn&#x27;t the page table have several levels?<br>
<p>
Would it be possible to make the number of levels variable, such that your normal pages were in level 5 like now, but you could allocate a large page at level 4, or a huge page at level 3, something like that?<br>
<p>
And of course, that means you simply break a level 4 page into level 5 pages if you need them, etc etc ...<br>

      <p>That's how large pages work on x86 today. The smallest level is 4 KiB pages; 512 of these are mapped by the next level up, which can also be used to map a single 2 MiB huge page. 512 of those are mapped by the next level up, which can also be used to map a single 1 GiB huge page. In theory, Intel/AMD could expand this to let you use a single entry to map 512 GiB contiguous RAM, but that's not interested them yet.

There are actually two structures describing memory:<br>
  1. The hardware page tables, used by the MMU, which already have a hierarchical structure using multiple levels,<br>
  2. The kernel&#x27;s own bookkeeping, using struct page, which is what this article is discussing.<br>

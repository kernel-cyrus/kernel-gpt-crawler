<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>September 2, 2009</br>
           </div>
<p>
One of the primary functions of any kernel is to manage the CPU resources
of the hardware that it is running on.  A recent <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/348325/">patch</a>, proposed by Raz
Ben-Yehuda, would change that, by removing one or more CPUs out from under the
kernel's control, so that processes could run, undisturbed, on those
processors.  The "offline scheduler", as Ben-Yehuda calls his patch, had
some rough sailing in the initial reactions to the idea, but as the thread
on linux-kernel evolved, kernel hackers stepped back and looked at the
problems it is trying to solve&mdash;and came up with other potential
solutions. 
</p>

<p>
The basic idea behind the offline scheduler is fairly straightforward: use
the CPU hot-unplug facility to remove the processor from the system, but
instead of halting the processor, allow other code to be run on it.
Because the processor would not be participating in the various CPU
synchronization schemes (RCU, spinlocks, etc.), nor would it be handling
interrupts, it can completely devote its attention to the code that it is
running.  The idea is that code running on the offline processor would not
suffer from any kernel-introduced latencies at all.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/350305/">core patch</a> is fairly small.  It
provides an interface to register a function to be called when a particular
CPU is taken offline:
<pre>
    int register_offsched(void (*offsched_callback)(void), int cpuid);
</pre>
This registers a callback that will be made when the CPU with the given
<tt>cpuid</tt> 
is taken offline (i.e. hot unplugged).  Typically, a user would load a
module that calls <tt>register_offsched()</tt>, then take the CPU
offline which triggers the callback on the just-offlined CPU.  When the
processing completes, and 
the callback returns, the 
processor will then be halted. 
At that point, the CPU can be brought back online and returned to the
kernel's control.

</blockquote>
<p> The interface points to one of the problems that potential users of the
offline scheduler have brought up: one can only run kernel-context, and not
user-space, code using the facility.  Because many of the applications that
might benefit from having the full attention of a CPU are existing
user-space programs, making the switch to in-kernel code is seen as
problematic.</p>

<p>
Ben-Yehuda <a href="/Articles/350306/">notes</a> that the isolated
processor has "<q>access to every piece of memory in the system</q>"
and the kernel would still have access to any memory that the isolated
processor is using.  He sees that as a benefit, but others, particularly
Mike Galbraith, <a href="/Articles/350307/">see</a> it differently:
<div class="BigQuote">
I personally find the concept of
injecting an RTOS into a general purpose OS with no isolation to be
alien.  Intriguing, but very very alien.
</div>
</p>

<p>
One of the main problems that some kernel hackers see with the offline
scheduler approach is that it 
bypasses Linux entirely.  That is, of course, the entire point of the
patch: devoting 100% of a CPU to a particular job.  As Christoph Lameter <a
href="/Articles/350309/">puts it</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
OFFSCHED takes the OS noise (interrupts,
timers, RCU, cacheline stealing etc etc) out of certain processors. You
cannot run an undisturbed piece of software on the OS right now.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Peter Zijlstra, though, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/350310/">sees</a> that as a major negative: "<q>Going around
the kernel doesn't benefit anybody, least of all Linux.</q>"  There are
existing ways to do the same thing, so adding one into the kernel adds no
benefit, he says:
<div class="BigQuote">
So its the concept of running stuff on a CPU outside of Linux that I
don't like. I mean, if you want that, go ahead and run RTLinux, RTAI,
L4-Linux etc.. lots of special non-Linux hypervisor/exo-kernel like
things around for you to run things outside Linux with.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But, Ben-Yehuda sees multiple applications for processors dedicated to
specific tasks.  He <a href="/Articles/350321/">envisions</a> a different kind of system, which he calls a
Service Oriented System (SOS), where the kernel is just one component, and
if the kernel "<q>disturbs</q>" a specific service, it should be
moved out of the way:
<div class="BigQuote">
What i am suggesting is merely a different approach of how to handle
multiple core systems. instead of thinking in processes, threads and so
on i am thinking in services. Why not take  a processor and define this
processor to do just firewalling ? encryption ? routing ? transmission ?
video processing... and so on... 
</div>
</p>

<p>
Moving the kernel out of the way is not particularly popular with many
kernel hackers.  But the idea of completely dedicating a processor to a
specific task is important to some users.  In the high performance
computing (HPC) world, multiple processors spend most of their time working
on a 
single, typically number-crunching, task. Removing even minimal
interruptions, those that perform scheduling and other kernel housekeeping
tasks, leads 
to better overall performance.  Essentially, those users want the
convenience of Linux running on one CPU, while the rest of the system's
CPUs are devoted to their particular application.
</p>

<p>
After a somewhat heated digression about generally reducing latencies in
the kernel, Andrew Morton <a href="/Articles/350330/">asked</a> for a
problem statement: "<q>All I've seen is 'I want 100% access to a CPU'.
That's not a problem 
statement - it's an implementation.</q>"
In answer, Chris Friesen <a href="/Articles/350331/">described</a> one
possible application:
<div class="BigQuote">
In our case the problem statement was that we had an inherently
single-threaded emulator app that we wanted to push as hard as
absolutely possible.
<p>
We gave it as close to a whole cpu as we could using cpu and irq
affinity and we used message queues in shared memory to allow another
cpu to handle I/O.  In our case we still had kernel threads running on
the app cpu, but if we'd had a straightforward way to avoid them we
would have used it.
</div>
</p>

<p>
That led Thomas Gleixner to <a href="/Articles/350338/">consider</a> an
alternative approach.  He restated the problem as: "<q>Run exactly one
thread on a dedicated CPU w/o any disturbance by the 
scheduler tick.</q>"  Given that definition, he suggested a fairly simple
approach:
<div class="BigQuote">
All you need is a way to tell the
kernel that CPUx can switch off the scheduler tick when only one
thread is running and that very thread is running in user space. Once
another thread arrives on that CPU or the single thread enters the
kernel for a blocking syscall the scheduler tick has to be
restarted.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Gregory Haskins then <a href="/Articles/350340/">suggested</a> modifying
the FIFO scheduler class, or creating a new class with a higher priority,
so that it disables the scheduler tick.  That would incorporate Gleixner's
idea into the existing scheduling framework.  As might be guessed, there
are still some details to work out on running a process without the
scheduler tick, but Gleixner and others think it is something that can be
done.
</p>

<p>
The offline scheduler itself kind of fell by the wayside in the
discussion.  Ben-Yehuda, unsurprisingly, is still pushing his approach, but
aside from the distaste expressed about circumventing the kernel, the
inability to run user-space code is problematic.  Gleixner was fairly <a
href="/Articles/350348/">blunt</a> about it:
<div class="BigQuote">
 I was talking about the problem that you
cannot run an ordinary user space task on your offlined CPU. That's
the main point where the design sucks. Having specialized programming
environments which impose tight restrictions on the application
programmer for no good reason are horrible.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Others are also thinking about the problem, as a similar idea to Gleixner's
was recently <a 
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/350153/">posted</a> by Josh Triplett in an
RFC to linux-kernel.  Triplett's tiny patch simply disables the timer tick
permanently 
as a demonstration of the gain in performance that can be achieved for CPU-bound
processes.  He notes that the overhead for the timer tick can be
significant:
<div class="BigQuote">
 On my system, the timer tick takes about
80us, every 1/HZ seconds; that represents a significant overhead.  80us
out of every 1ms, for instance, means 8% overhead.  Furthermore, the
time taken varies, and the timer interrupts lead to jitter in the
performance of the number crunching.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Triplett warns that his patch is "<q>by no means represents a complete
solution</q>" in that it breaks RCU, process accounting, and other
things.  But it does boot and can run his tests.  He has fixes for some of
those problems in progress, as well as an overall goal: "<q>I'd like to work towards a patch which really can kill off the timer
tick, making the kernel entirely event-driven and removing the polling
that occurs in the timer tick.  I've reviewed everything the timer tick
does, and every last bit of it could occur using an event-driven
approach.</q>"
</p>

<p>
It is pretty unlikely that we will see the offline scheduler ever make it
into the mainline, but the idea behind it has spawned some interesting
discussions that may lead to a solution for those looking to eliminate
kernel overhead on some CPUs.  In many ways, it is another example of the
perils of 
developing kernel code in isolation.  Had Ben-Yehuda been working in the
open, and looking for comments from the kernel community, he might have
realized that his approach would not be acceptable&mdash;at least for the
mainline&mdash;much sooner.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Only now has the discussion reached the point where 'prominent' scheduler hackers are offering much more comment than "why would you want to do that?" and realising that there is a genuine need which this hack is an attempt to address.
</i>
<p>
As the article mentioned, the crux of the issue is a dynamic (not HZ driven) scheduler tick.
<p>
If you followed scheduler development you might have noticed that this (dynamic scheduler tick) was implemented 1.5 years ago by Peter Zijstra (who is the other scheduler maintainer in addition to myself).
</p>
For details, see this upstream commit:
<pre>
    commit 8f4d37ec073c17e2d4aa8851df5837d798606d6f
    Author: Peter Zijlstra < a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl >
    Date:   Fri Jan 25 21:08:29 2008 +0100

        sched: high-res preemption tick
</pre>
<p>
It was released in the v2.6.26 kernel iirc.
<p>
Nobody was really interested in it though and it had stability problems so it's disabled currently. It's a nice feature and completing that would speed up _all_ applications which are currently interrupted HZ times a second.
<p>
So not only have the scheduler maintainers realized this problem years ago, they have also implemented a rough prototype solution as well and tried to productize it. Given enough interest in this topic, it could be finished - most of the code is still there.
</p>
So i'm with Thomas on this one: the 'offline scheduler' is on the wrong track in its current form and we can do better than that. The scheduler maintainers (have to) insist on things to be implemented correctly and cleanly so that as many Linux applications can benefit from the end result as possible - not just the proprietary code Ben-Yehuda claimed the 'offline scheduler' was designed for.

Hello Mingo<br>

1. the offline scheduler is about treating a processor as a device. this is why I am offloading it. i have compared in my essay several partition- system, CPU sets, INtime and IBM partitions. I did not comare it to dynticks because dynticks is simply a different matter.<br>

Hello Mingo

<p>
The "offline scheduler" is, as you say, a CPU partitioning scheme.
<p>
Our (oft repeated) point is that Linux already has a CPU partitioning scheme: cpusets. It can be configured dynamically and will isolate one (or more CPUs) just fine.
<p>
This cpusets scheduler feature has been added to the Linux kernel 4.5 years ago in 2005, and has been released as part of the v2.6.12 Linux kernel. It has been part of Linux ever since then - continuously fixed/updated/enhanced.
<p>
If cpusets as implemented today does not fit your needs then the (upstream acceptable) solution is <i>not</i> to add a completely different facility with its extra layering, but to fix the currently existing one. 
<p>
That will benefit all current cpusets users as well beyond enabling the usecases you are interested in.
<p>
A new facility is only added if the old one is unfixable. That has not been outlined here - it has not even been argued to be unfixable. [If that is proven then the new facility will simply replace the old (broken) one.]
<p>
This is really how the Linux kernel is developed - and always was. We try to avoid reinventing the wheel and we try to avoid duplicate functionality in the core kernel as much as possible. This is what is happening here too.
<p>
It sure does mean extra work and requires willingness to work with existing upstream facilities.
<p>
Duplicate/overlapping functionality quickly becomes a mess to users and is unmaintainable as well in the long run due to the increased complexity. We try to avoid such overlap and duplication as much as possible.
<p>
The lkml discussions with you stalled because you basically only repeated your arguments why you'd want to have the offline scheduler (which in itself is fine) - without showing much interest in improving existing kernel facilities or showing that they are unfixable (which is not fine if you want to enhance the upstream kernel).
<p>
Anyway, there's lots of possibilities how to continue this on the technical level. Everyone agrees that undisturbed CPU cores are desirable, so if you (or someone else) implements it correctly it will be accepted upstream - and gladly so. The job of a maintainer (like me) is to say 'no' to patches that are (not yet) good enough technically.
<p>
Thanks,

Hello again Ingo<br>
<p>
Well, I understand your arguments and agree with the "upstream" consideration. the offline scheduler approach is agressive . when i offlined napi, i had to do some re-writing in dev.c . <br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;The lkml discussions with you stalled because you basically only &gt;repeated your arguments why you'd want to have the offline scheduler &gt;(which in itself is fine) - without showing much interest in improving &gt;existing kernel facilities or showing that they are unfixable (which is &gt;not fine if you want to enhance the upstream kernel</font><br>
<p>
In the case of cpu sets, i argue that cpu sets do not provide complete partitioning. Meaning , i cannot ask a packet from 10gbps interface to be moved to processor X and another packet from the same 10gbps interface to be moved to processor Y. why should a flash video packet be moved to processor 7 if processor 7 is heavily busy with incoming ftp traffic ?<br>
<p>
For the best of my knowledge; a napi context is triggered by the first packet which can be any processor "in the affinity".<br>
<p>
But this is possible by offlin'ing napi. just simply route packets by their service type; not by irq masking;  And who care for cache misses if i have an entire processor to do that work;   <br>
<p>
But you are correct that i haven't replied with technical details. i just posted the link to the essay. <br>
<p>
what is correct way to isolate a processor, What are the restrictions ? what are the requirements ? <br>
<p>
Raz<br>

<p>
Obviously they do not, as otherwise you would not have implemented your patch.
<p>
My point, which i outlined in more detail in my reply above, is that there are two approaches possible that are acceptable for upstreaming:
<p>
- either extend and fix cpusets with the features you desire
<p>
- or prove/show that that's impossible or undesirable. (in which case your solution will have to replace cpusets, cover all its usecases, migrate all its APIs and users smoothly, etc., etc.)
<p>
You took a third approach: "I added it as a new, separate, special-purpose feature, not integrated with existing cpusets facilities because it was the easiest for me that way".
<p>
That is the ... short-term easy but long-term expensive answer which people on lkml objected to for good reasons. We've been there, we've done that, we are still suffering the consequences ;-)
<p>
Linux is a 18+ years old kernel, there's not that many easy projects left in it anymore :-/ Core kernel features that look basic and which are not in Linux yet often turn out to be not that simple.
<p>
I hope this explains our point of view. We can continue this discussion on lkml - i'm very interested in extensions to cpusets and Peter Zijstra outlined models for integrating IRQ space partitioning into the cpusets model. (he called them system-sets) He sent a few prototype patches to lkml as well - early 2008 IIRC. Those could be picked up and finished, if you are interested.
<p>
Thanks,
<p>
Ingo

I've been using dynamic tick for over a year.  I just checked and I have the kernel option for it enabled in my 2.6.29.6 kernel.  When was it disabled?  Will you bring it back?<br>

As far as i'm concerned the patches do not irritate me - why should they? (I dont find them upstream acceptable in their current form but hey, most of my own feature patches are not acceptable in their initial form either ;-)
<p>
"Staying low" is the worst possibly strategy if you want to improve the upstream kernel. Engaging in the process and listening to upstream feedback and acting on suggestions is important.

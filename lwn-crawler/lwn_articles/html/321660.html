<p>
A kernel patch that reduces memory, while providing a performance increase
of roughly a factor of three, is generally seen as a good thing.  But, when
there is another, more-or-less equivalent&mdash;but much faster&mdash;way
to perform that action, it 
may appear to be an unnecessary optimization.  A recent <a
href="/Articles/321730/">patch to the <tt>ftrace_printk()</tt> function</a>
has those characteristics, but the ability to get such a speed increase,
even in something that is just convenient&mdash;rather than
required&mdash;may well 
trump the concerns about the necessity.
</p>

<p>
Lai Jiangshan proposed adding a binary version of <tt>ftrace_printk()</tt>
last December; Frederic Weisbecker has picked up the patches and
submitted them for inclusion into ftrace.  The basic idea is that rather than
converting the arguments to strings&mdash;as specified in a
<tt>printk()</tt>-style format
string&mdash;<tt>ftrace_bprintk()</tt> would defer the actual
conversion until the trace output is read by user space.  Instead it would
put the binary values into the ring buffer, along with a pointer to the
format string.  When the trace data is read from <tt>debugfs</tt>, the
format string and binary data are used to construct the output.
</p>

<p>
Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/321742/">liked the idea</a>, but was unhappy
with the implementation that duplicated much of the code in
<tt>vsnprintf()</tt> into two new functions.  He suggested that it should
be possible to pull out the common code: "<q>We should try _much_ harder
at unifying these functions before  
giving up and duplicating them.</q>"  Weisbecker agreed, which
eventually resulted in a <a href="/Articles/321739/">patch</a> that breaks
out the format string decoding as a separate function.
</p>

<p>
Molnar also asked for some performance numbers, which 
Weisbecker provided as part of his patch.  He reported the memory and time
difference when adding:
<pre>
    ftrace_printk("This is the timer interrupt: %llu", jiffies_64);
</pre>
to the timer interrupt.  The memory used was less than half (16 versus 39
bytes per entry), and the time savings was also significant:
<div class="BigQuote">
<p>
After some time running on low load (no X, no really active processes):
<pre>
    ftrace_printk:  duration average: 2044 ns, avg of bytes stored per entry: 39
    ftrace_bprintk: duration average: 1426 ns, avg of bytes stored per entry: 16
</pre>
<p>
Higher load (started X and launched a cat running on an X console looping on
traces printing):
<pre>
    ftrace_printk:  duration average: 8812 ns
    ftrace_bprintk: duration average: 2611 ns
</pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Andrew Morton was <a href="/Articles/321743/">a bit puzzled</a> by the
intent of the patch: "<q>Trying to make something which is inherently
slow run slightly faster seems...odd.</q>"  But Molnar <a
href="/Articles/321772/">explained</a> why it makes sense:
<div class="BigQuote">
The _fastest_ way of tracing is obviously to know about the 
precise argument layout and having a specific C based tracepoint 
stub that directly stuffs that data into the ring buffer. Most 
tracepoints are of such nature.
<p>
That does not remove the ease of use of ad-hoc printk-alike 
tracepoints though, and speeding them up 3-fold is a [worthwhile]
goal.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Breaking out the format string handling into its own
<tt>format_decode()</tt> function was mostly met with approval, except that
the argument list is rather ugly:
<pre>
    int format_decode(const char *fmt, enum format_type *type, 
                      int *flags, int *field_width, int *base, 
                      int *precision, int *qualifier)
</pre>
Linus Torvalds <a href="/Articles/321773/">suggested</a> using a <tt>struct
printf_spec</tt> 
to contain the various values decoded from the format specifier, passing
a pointer to that into the function.
Weisbecker agreed, and added that into his patches, but he didn't quite go
far enough.
</p>

<p>
Torvalds also thought that the various helper functions to handle specific
formats 
(i.e. <tt>number()</tt>, <tt>pointer()</tt>, <tt>string()</tt>, etc.)
should get passed a <tt>struct printf_spec</tt> pointer as well.  As
he <a href="/Articles/321774/">points out</a>: "<q>When 
cleaning up, let's just do it properly.</q>"  Once again, Weisbecker was
quick to agree; he plans to respin the patches addressing these and other
comments in the near future.
</p>

<p>
In addition, because <tt>ftrace_bprintk()</tt> is a drop-in replacement for
<tt>ftrace_printk()</tt>, Weisbecker <a
href="/Articles/321779/">proposes</a> eliminating the current code in favor
of the faster version.  Molnar, at least, <a
href="/Articles/321780/">advocates</a> that outcome:
<div class="BigQuote">
Well, ftrace_bprintk() seems to be a worthy and transparent 
replacement for ftrace_printk() to me. I.e. lets just use this 
as the new implementation for ftrace_printk().
</div>
</p>

<p>
While it is a minor upgrade to a relatively minor kernel subsystem, it does
provide some impressive performance gains.  As a bonus, the review process
has resulted in some clean-up that was probably overdue.  While there is
validity to the argument that it is not really <i>required</i>, it is
not very intrusive, nor very large.  In the end, that is likely to be
enough to see it eventually end up in the mainline.

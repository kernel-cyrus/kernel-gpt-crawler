<h1>Shielding driver authors from locking</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 20, 2010</br>
           </div>
Much of the time, patches can be developed against the mainline kernel and
submitted for the next merge window without trouble.  At other times,
though, the mainline is far removed from the environment a patch will have
to fit into at merge time.  Your editor, who has been trying the
(considerable) patience of the Video4Linux maintainer by trying to get a
driver merged for 2.6.37 at the last minute, has encountered this fact of
life the hard way: he submitted a driver which did not even come close to
compiling inside the 2.6.37 V4L2 tree.  Things have changed considerably
there.  This article will look at one of those changes with an eye
toward the kind of design decisions that are being made in that part of the
kernel. 
<p>
The removal of the big kernel lock (BKL) has been documented here over the
years.  One of the biggest holdouts at this point is the V4L2 subsystem;
almost everything that happens in a V4L2 driver is the result of an
<tt>ioctl()</tt> call, and those calls have always been protected by the
BKL.  Removing BKL protection means auditing the drivers - and there are a
lot of them - and, in many cases, providing a replacement locking scheme.
It seems that a lot of V4L2 drivers - especially the older ones - do not
exhibit the sort of attention to locking that one would expect from code
submitted today.
<p>
The approach to this problem chosen by the V4L2 developers has proved to be
mildly controversial within the group: they have tried to make it possible
for driver authors to continue to avoid paying attention to locking.  To
that end, the <tt>video_device</tt> structure has gained a new
<tt>lock</tt> field; it is a pointer to a mutex.  If that field is
non-null, the V4L2 core will acquire the mutex before calling any of the
vast number of driver callbacks.  So all driver operations are inherently
serialized and driver authors need not worry about things.  At least, they
need not worry in the absence of other types of concurrency - like
interrupts.
<p>
Hans Verkuil, the developer behind many recent V4L2 improvements, clearly
<a href="/Articles/410858/">feels</a> that it's better to handle the
locking centrally:

<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If he wants to punish himself and do all the locking manually (and
	prove that it is correct), then by all means, do so. If you want to
	use the core locking support and so simplify your driver and allow
	your brain to concentrate on getting the hardware to work, rather
	than trying to get the locking right, then that's fine as well. As
	a code reviewer I'd definitely prefer the latter approach as it
	makes my life much easier.
</div>
<p>
On the other side, developers like Laurent Pinchart <a
href="/Articles/410859/">argue</a> that trying to insulate developers from
locking is not the right approach:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 Developers must not get told to be stupid and don't care about
	 locks just because other developers got it wrong in the past. If
	 people don't get locking right we need to educate them, not
	 encourage them to understand even less of it.
</div>
<p>
Central locking at the V4L2 level leads to some interesting problems as
well.  The V4L2 user-space <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/240667/">streaming API</a> offers a pair of
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls for the management of frame buffers:
<tt>VIDIOC_DQBUF</tt> to obtain a buffer from the driver, and
<tt>VIDIOC_QBUF</tt> to give a buffer back.  If there are no buffers
available at the time of the call, <tt>VIDIOC_DQBUF</tt> will normally
block until a buffer becomes available.  When this call is protected by the
BKL, blocking will automatically release the lock and enable other V4L2
operations to continue.  That behavior is important: one of those other
operations might be a <tt>VIDIOC_QBUF</tt> call providing the buffer needed
to allow the <tt>VIDIOC_DQBUF</tt> call to proceed; if
<tt>VIDIOC_DQBUF</tt> fails to release the lock, things
could deadlock.
<p>
Drivers which handle their own locking will naturally release locks
before blocking in a situation like this.  Either the driver author thinks
of it at the outset, or the need is made clear by disgruntled users later
on.  If the driver author is not even aware that the lock exists, though,
it's less likely that the lock will be released at a time like this.  That
could lead to surprises in drivers which do their own I/O buffer
management.  If, however,
the driver uses <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/363349/">videobuf</a>,
this problem will be handled transparently 
with some scary-looking code in
<tt>videobuf_waiton()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    is_ext_locked = q-&gt;ext_lock &amp;&amp; mutex_is_locked(q-&gt;ext_lock);

    /* Release vdev lock to prevent this wait from blocking outside access to
       the device. */
    if (is_ext_locked)
	mutex_unlock(q-&gt;ext_lock);
</pre>
<p>

With enough due care, one assumes that it's possible to be sure that
unlocking a mutex acquired elsewhere is a reasonable thing to do here.  But
one must hope that the driver author - who is not concerned with locking,
after all - has left things in a consistent state before calling
<tt>videobuf_waiton()</tt>.  Otherwise those disgruntled users will
eventually make a return.
<p>
Locking complexity in the kernel is growing, and that makes it harder for
developers to come up to speed.  Complex locking can be an especially
difficult challenge for somebody writing this type of driver; these authors
tend not to be full-time kernel developers.  So the appeal of taking care
of locking for them and letting them concentrate on getting their hardware
to do reasonable things is clear, especially if it makes the code review
process easier as well.  Such efforts may ultimately be
successful, but there can be no doubt that they will run into disagreement
from those who feel that kernel developers should either understand what is
going on or switch to Java development.  Expect this sort of discussion to
pop up in a number of contexts as core developers try to make it easier for
others to write correct code.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

"If people don't get locking right we need to educate them, not encourage them to understand even less of it." Reading that quote flabbergasted me. I'm floored. KO'ed.<br>
<p>
Lets take the great insidious Medusa of programming, spread it's execution over possibly hundreds of people and somehow "educate" them so they all execute correctly and things come out well in the end.<br>
<p>
No way should we take time get the locking right once and let people focus on their individual areas of expertise.<br>
<p>
How does one, over a ten plus year engineering career arrive at an opinion that on the face of it is utter madness. (I'm genuinely curious. Maybe I'm wrong but...)<br>
<p>
Division of labor is the foundation of modern civilization. While it's important that the participants in these division be educated and have knowledge of how their actions impact other divisions, that should not preempt the implementation of the division itself.<br>

This sounds sensible -- essentially it's the Windows Driver Foundation argument; that you should be able to develop in a friendly, simple but inefficient environment and gradually pull in the more awesome powers of the full kernel environment as you need to. So your driver for a serial IR device that only ever needs to cope with 9.6kbps can be written like the system is very simple indeed, whilst that for a 100Gbps network card perhaps needs to pull out all the stops to minimise the number of machine instructions to send a packet, or maximise parallelism when working with dozens of cores.<br>
<p>
The WDF guys needed to solve the blocking-call thing of course; their approach was to say that I/O request packets had to be either completed within a driver callback or else placed in a queue for later retrieval in response to an event or timer; placing it in an internal queue would release the device or instance-wide lock. Busy-waiting or sleeping inside a callback was always an error. It's troubling for this purpose that Linux's model of in-progress kernel calls is very much tied to the C stack, but it seems like it wouldn't be too difficult to remodel using aio as the standard and synchronous calls as a simple wrapper atop that which takes place outside the driver framework's locking scheme.<br>

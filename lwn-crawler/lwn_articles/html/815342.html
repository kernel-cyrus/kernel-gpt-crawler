The kernel's memory-management subsystem goes to great lengths to keep the
pages that are actually in use in memory.  But sometimes it gets things
wrong, leading to reduced performance or, in the worst cases, flat-out
thrashing.  We may be about to see a significant improvement, though,
thanks to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1584423717-3440-1-git-send-email-iamjoonsoo.kim@lge.com/">a
patch set</a> from Joonsoo Kim changing how anonymous pages (those
containing data not backed by files on disk) are managed.
As it turns out, all that had to be done was to make use of some work that
already exists in related parts of the memory-management code.
<p>
<h4>LRU lists</h4>
A bit of background may be helpful for understanding how this patch set
works; we'll start with a highly oversimplified picture, then add some
details as we go.
<p>
Virtual-memory systems allow applications to address far more memory than
can actually fit into the physical memory installed in the system, so a
significant part of any given process's address space is likely to exist
only on secondary storage at any given time.  Obviously, the pages that are
in physical memory should be the ones that the process is going to use in
the near future.  The kernel cannot know for sure which pages will be
useful, though, so it must fall back onto a set of heuristics that allow it to
guess as well as it can.
<p>
Some of those heuristics are reasonably straightforward.  For example, if a
process is observed to be working through a file sequentially, chances are
pretty good that it will soon be wanting the pages of the file immediately
after those it is accessing now.  Another heuristic, found at the core of
almost any virtual-memory implementation, is that pages that have been used
recently are likely to be used in the future, while those that have
languished unused for a while may not be worth keeping around.
<p>
To implement that last approach, the kernel maintains a "least-recently
used" (LRU) list; all user-space pages in physical memory are kept on
that list.  The kernel occasionally checks the pages on the LRU list and
moves those that have been accessed recently to the head of the list.  When
more memory is needed, to bring in pages from secondary storage, for
example, pages at the tail end of the list are reclaimed.
<p>
In truth, the kernel maintains more than one LRU list.  To begin with, the
"LRU list" is actually two lists: the "active" and "inactive" lists.  The
active list functions mostly as described in the previous paragraph, except
that, when pages fall off the tail of the list, they are put onto the
inactive list instead.  At that point, the protections on those pages are
set to disallow all user-space access.  Should some process access one of
those pages, a "soft" page fault will result; the page will be made
accessible again 
and returned to the active list.  When memory is needed, pages will be
reclaimed from the inactive list.
<p>
The inactive list thus serves as a sort of second chance for pages that are
on their way out.  But it also plays another role: managing pages that are
highly likely to only be used once.  A classic example is a process reading
through a file; the pages read will probably be processed and not be needed
again.  These 
pages probably should not push out memory that <i>is</i> likely to be
useful in the future.  The kernel handles this case by putting newly
faulted, file-backed pages
directly onto the inactive list; they will only move to the active list if
they are accessed again before being reclaimed.
<p>
In truth, things are more complicated that that; among other things, there
are more than two LRU lists.  Relevant here is the fact that there are
separate active and inactive lists for file-backed and anonymous pages.  It
is common to reclaim file-backed pages before anonymous pages, since the
former often need not be written back (while anonymous pages must always be
written to swap) and can be easier to get back if need
be.  It is also worth noting that, in the case of file-backed pages, the
kernel maintains "shadow entries" to remember (for a while) the existence
of pages that have been 
reclaimed off the inactive list.  If those pages are "refaulted" back in,
the kernel knows that it's pushing out useful pages and can make
adjustments to try to avoid doing that.
<p>
<h4>Improving anonymous LRU-list behavior</h4>
<p>
Kim's patch set addresses two significant differences between how anonymous
and file-backed pages are handled.  One of those is that, while file-backed
pages are faulted into the inactive list as described above, anonymous
pages go directly to the active list.  If an application faults in a lot of
anonymous pages, it will likely push other useful pages off the active list
onto the inactive list.  If the newly faulted pages are only used once,
though, they will push aside other, more useful pages needlessly.  To
address this, Kim's patch set causes anonymous pages to be faulted into the
inactive list, just like file-backed pages are.  If those pages are truly
useful, they will be promoted to the active list when the soft fault
happens; otherwise they can be reclaimed relatively quickly.
<p>
The other change addresses the fact that refault tracking, in current
kernels, is only done for the file-backed LRU list.  Once an anonymous page
is reclaimed, the kernel forgets about its history.  As it turns out, the
previous change (faulting pages into the inactive list) can exacerbate some
bad behavior: adding new pages to the inactive list can quickly push out
other pages that were just faulted in before they can be accessed a second
time and promoted to the active list.  If refault tracking were done for
the anonymous LRU list, this situation could be detected and dealt with.
<p>
So the patch set adds this tracking for anonymous pages.  In a sense the
work was straightforward, since the infrastructure for refault tracking
already exists and can be reused; it simply needs to be extended to track
more than one LRU list.  There are some added details, though.  Since anonymous
pages are written to swap when they are reclaimed, the shadow LRU entry
used to track refaults can be written there as well rather than being kept
in RAM, for example.
<p>
Kim included a number of benchmarks showing how these patches improve
memory-management behavior in various situations.  What really <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200226193942.30049da9c090b466bdc5ec23@linux-foundation.org/">got
the attention</a> of memory-management maintainer Andrew Morton, though,
was <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200227022905.GH6548@shao2-debian/">this
automated test result</a> showing a 400% improvement in a virtual-memory
scalability test.  He asked: "<q>One wonders why on earth we weren't
doing these things in the first place?</q>"  Kim <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200227074748.GA18113@js1304-desktop/">replied</a>
with copies of the patches adding the current behavior in 2002 — written by
a certain Andrew Morton, who <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200229204000.298de32521885b8af858a50d@linux-foundation.org/">acknowledged</a>
that it may well be time to revisit some of that work.
<p>
There does not appear to be any opposition to this work in the
memory-management community.  That does not necessarily mean that it will
be merged soon; memory-management patches often require a lot of testing
and review before developers become confident enough to apply them.  That is
doubly true of patches affecting heuristics, since they can often cause
unexpected problems in surprising places.  These patches have not even made
it into the -mm tree yet, a step that would increase both testing and
review.  So, even though Morton has <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200227153639.951d6a42080e8d4227872e64@linux-foundation.org/">said</a>
that "<q>given all the potential benefits, perhaps I should be more
aggressive here</q>", this work doesn't look like 5.7 material.  It may
well find its way upstream shortly thereafter, though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Seems to be an axiom of source code: when you ask "why is &lt;thing&gt; this way" you will invariably find that you were the one in the distant (or not) past who wrote it.<br>
<p>
Just yesterday at work we had a horrible bug from code written in 2006 finally surface. The developer who was investigating and fixing eventually wondered who wrote the buggy code in the first place (while also trying to dig up notes on why it was written how it was at all). Turned out to be one of her first projects when she was hired right out of college and no one else had touched it since.<br>
<p>
To credit, it did basically work for about fifteen years without major issue until now.<br>

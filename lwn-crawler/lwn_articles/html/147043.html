<div class="ArticleText">
Red Hat recently <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/en_us/USA/Home/Company/News%2Band%2BEvents/Red%2BHat%2BPress%2BRelease%2BArchive/2005/Fedora%2BCore%2B4%2BNow%2BAvailable%2Bwith%2BGlobal%2BFile%2BSystem.html">announced</a>
that Fedora Core&nbsp;4 was available with the Global Filesystem (GFS).
Like Oracle's OCFS2, GFS allows a tightly-linked cluster to manage
filesystems stored on a shared disk.  Now that GFS is actually shipping,
Red Hat would like to see it merged into the mainline kernel.  Thus,
recently, David Teigland <a href="/Articles/145890/">posted the patches for
review</a> and asked for feedback.  He got some.
<p>

One issue has to do with locking.  Since the filesystem is kept on shared
storage, the nodes of the cluster must take care to avoid stepping on each
others' toes and corrupting things.  The distributed lock manager (DLM)
subsystem is used to that end; whenever a node wishes to access a
particular block on the filesystem, it first obtains a cluster-wide lock on
that block.  As long as the filesystem only supports the <tt>read()</tt>
and <tt>write()</tt> system calls, this locking works reasonably well.  The
filesystem code can obtain the locks it needs, perform the operation, then
return the locks, and all works well.

<p>
The problem comes in when the filesystem supports <tt>mmap()</tt> as well.
Accesses to memory mapped with <tt>mmap()</tt> does not happen with the
<tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> system calls; it is, instead, done
with regular memory operations.  Locking in this case is handled in
conjunction with the virtual memory subsystem; the permissions on any
particular page are set to be consistent with the level of lock currently
held by the local node.  If the node does not have a lock for a specific
block in the filesystem, the page table entry for the corresponding page
will show that page as being absent.  If the process which made the mapping
tries to access the page, it will incur a page fault; the filesystems
<tt>nopage()</tt> method can then set up the mapping, acquiring whatever
locks are required.

<p>

Page faults are asynchronous events.  In particular, a page fault could
happen while the kernel is busy handling a <tt>read()</tt> or
<tt>write()</tt> operation somewhere else in the filesystem.  In this case,
the kernel will be acquiring two independent locks in the filesystem, and
in an arbitrary order.  It does not take much experience with locking to
learn that, when multiple locks are to be acquired, the order in which they
are taken is critical.  Consider a case where there are two locks (call
them "A" and "B") and two processes needing them.  Imagine that one process
acquires A, while the other acquires B.  Each process then attempts to grab
the remaining lock.  At this point, both processes will wait forever; this
situation is called an "ABBA deadlock."  Contrary to what some may believe,
the term has nothing to do with 1970's Swedish rock bands.
<p>

Avoiding this kind of deadlock requires a fair amount of ugly filesystem
trickery; Zach Brown <a href="/Articles/147046/">put it this way</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So clustered file systems in Linux (GFS, Lustre, OCFS2, (GPFS?))
	all walk vmas in their file-&gt;{read,write} to discover mappings that
	belong to their files so that they can preemptively sort and
	acquire the locks that will be needed to cover the mappings that
	might be established in -&gt;nopage. As you point out, this both
	relies on the mappings not changing and gets very exciting when you
	mix files and mappings between file systems that are each sorting
	and acquiring their own DLM locks.
</div>
<p>

Sorting this situation out properly will probably require some sort of
support at the VFS layer.  In that way, one hopes, a single, working
solution would be found.  The alternative seems to be a bunch of brittle
and complicated code in each filesystem which has this problem.
<p>

Another glitch encountered by GFS is its support for "context-dependent
path names."  These are, in essence, symbolic links with magic properties.
The GFS code, if it encounters "<tt>@hostname</tt>" as a component in a
symbolic link, will substitute the name of the current host.  Similar
substitutions will happen for <tt>@mach</tt>, <tt>@os</tt>, <tt>@uid</tt>,
and others.  There is also support for an alternative syntax
("<tt>{hostname}</tt>"), for whatever reason.
<p>

This mechanism exists to allow cluster nodes to establish private areas on
a shared disk.  It can also be used, for example, to create
architecture-specific directories full of binaries on a common path.  In
the past, administrators have used automounter trickery to a very similar
end.  The filesystem hackers, who do not like to see this sort of magic
buried within individual filesystems, suggest that bind mounts should be
used instead.  That technique, however, is relatively cumbersome and
error-prone, so there is some interest in finding a way to maintain the
sort of functionality implemented by context-dependent links.

<p>

The objections to context-dependent links include the addition of magic to
parts of the filesystem namespace and the fact that they are specific to
one filesystem.  Moving the resolution of these links up to the VFS layer
could be a part of the solution, since it would then at least function the
same way for all filesystems.  Adding this kind of semantics may always be
a hard sell, however, since it changes the way Linux filesystems are
expected to behave.  The old, automounter-based approach may end up being
the recommended technique for those needing this sort of behavior.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

As pointed out in the article, this symlink content scanning is completely unnecessary bloat, whos functionality can be accomplished through other functionality already available in the kernel.
</p>

<pre>
@hostname  Boot-time symlink or bind mount
@mach      Boot-time symlink or bind mount
@os        Boot-time symlink or bind mount
@uid       Private namespaces
</pre>

<p>
I built a cluster a few years back that booted 36 completely diskless nodes off a single shared readonly NFS root. This involved about 5 lines of bindmounting and tmpfs, along with commenting out fsck checks and suchnot. That cluster is still operational, sitting in a room about 10 yards away. :)
</p>

<p>
The problem has already been solved. Please, no more bloat!

      It gets a bit tricky if you've got a couple hundred symlinks bin -&gt; @os/bin in different directories. The point with using symlinks for it is that regular users can create these links without suid programs when they want portions of their home directories to behave differently on different hosts.<br>
<p>
Of course, this should probably be an aspect of namespaces, such that it applies to everything, but only if you've enabled it.<br>

      The Andrew File System (AFS) has a similar mechanism where a pathname component named @sys instead goes to your hardware platform.  On my box here at work (we're a big AFS shop),<br>
<p>
  .../@sys/bin/mozilla<br>
<p>
goes to<br>
<p>
  .../ia32.linux.2.4.glibc.2.3/bin/mozilla<br>
<p>
and we use this to store binaries for multiple architectures side by side.<br>
<p>
This has existed in AFS forever, and is supported in Linux.  I'm not sure why this is not a problem in AFS but would be a problem for GFS.<br>
<p>
Could this be the location where the magic @sys token gets expanded?  In AFS, this is all done on the client side, so the fileserver is not aware of the magic / trickery in the lookup.<br>

<p>
If that's a valid objection, we need to get rid of the "followlink" inode operation.  Its existence specifically says that the meaning of symbolic link contents is filesystem-type-dependent.  The common path walk code could as easily do a "readlink" inode operation and interpret the contents as a path itself.  So someone wanted it that way.
<p>
In the continual battle between filesystem type consistency and filesystem type diversity, the VFS interface is what defines the front.

      I remember the sequent and pyramid boxes of a decade or two back ... these machines were multi universe ones: processes could see either System V or BSD system calls and file system layout - depending on the universe that the process was in.<br>
<p>
One 'feature' was a conditional symbolic link ... what it pointed to depended on the universe setting.<br>
<p>
Sounds like a nice idea, but it was vile. I hated it.<br>

<h1>Pointy-haired kernel hackers?</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 11, 2007 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
Don Marti attended Greg Kroah-Hartman's Linux Symposium talk on the kernel
development process; he wrote an informative article (titled <a
href="http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2007/062807-linux-contributor-base.html">Linux
contributor base broadens</a>) about it.  The article states:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In the latest kernel release, the most active 30 developers
	authored only 30% of the changes, while two years ago, the top 20
	developers did 80% of the changes, he said. Kroah-Hartman himself
	is now doing more code reviewing than coding. "That's all I do, is
	read patches these days," he said.
</div>
<p>
An important part of this is that Greg presented this change as a 
good thing.  The kernel has a far broader developer base than it once did,
with patches for any given release coming from almost 1000 different
people.  We have a growing development community which is healthy and
robust.
<p>

Seeing what the mainstream media makes of things can be great fun
sometimes.  This time around, ComputerWorld&nbsp;UK picked up Don's
article, running the same text but giving it a new title: <a
href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/technology/hardware/processors/news-analysis/index.cfm?articleid=604&pn=1">Are
top Linux developers losing the will to code?</a>  Slashdot picked it up
under that title, then Wired chimed in with <a
href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/core-linux-deve.html">Core
Linux Developers Stuck In Middle Management Mode</a>, complete with a
picture of a necktie-wearing employee wielding a stapler and a telephone.
The prize must go to the Jem Report's <a
href="http://www.thejemreport.com/mambo/content/view/320" rel="nofollow">The coders and
the talkers</a>, though; this article breaks new ground completely:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Linus' [sic] job is leaning more towards spokesman than
	programmer. He's been a relatively effective manager up until now,
	but I think that effectiveness will begin to erode rapidly with
	time. The further you get away from the actual work, the less you
	are able to accurately judge the appropriateness of other people's
	work. You need to stay in the game -- you need to keep your skills
	in condition. If you don't, you might understand the theory pretty
	well, but you'll get further and further away from being in touch
	with its application. Linus has become more of a talker and less of
	a coder.
</div>
<p>

It seems we have trouble here.  While we weren't looking, the Linux kernel
drifted into a Dilbertesque realm and is now controlled by people who don't
actually create software anymore.  World Domination, it would seem, is now
in grave doubt.
<p>

Or perhaps all of this is just silly nonsense, an extreme extrapolation
taken from a couple of sentences spoken at a Linux developer conference.  
<p>

If one wanted to investigate this subject further, a good starting place
might be the <a 
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/240666/">2.6.22 changelog</a>; there one can
see just how many patches our pointy-haired top-level maintainers have
contributed over the latest development cycle.  Here's a subset:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing=3>
<tr><th>Developer</th><th>Patches</th></tr>

<tr class="Even">
    <td>Andi Kleen</td>
    <td align="right">70</td>
</tr>

<tr class="Odd">
    <td>Andrew Morton</td>
    <td align="right">79</td>
</tr>


<tr class="Even">
    <td>David Miller</td>
    <td align="right">193</td>
</tr>


<tr class="Odd">
    <td>Greg Kroah-Hartman</td>
    <td align="right">14</td>
</tr>

<tr class="Even">
    <td>James Bottomley</td>
    <td align="right">13</td>
</tr>


<tr class="Odd">
    <td>Linus Torvalds</td>
    <td align="right">20</td>
</tr>


<tr class="Even">
    <td>Russell King</td>
    <td align="right">61</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>

One could add more names to the list, but the end result would be about the
same: the top-level kernel maintainers are not among the most prolific
contributors (except maybe for David Miller - but, then, he's an exception
in many regards), but neither are they absent from the game.  They are
still hacking on the code and cranking out the patches.
<p>

From some of the articles that have been posted, one might think that
subsystem maintainers spend the rest of their time attending meetings and
writing weekly reports.  What they are actually doing is working with
patches - lots of patches - and with developers.  A subsystem maintainer
must review code, decide whether it is appropriate for the kernel, and, if
not, give the developer guidance on how to make it better.  Incoming patch
streams must be merged together, and decisions must be made on which ones
are ready for any given development cycle.  It is a task which requires the
maintainers to keep their hands deep in the code.  Subsystem maintainers
who do not touch the code, and who do not maintain a deep understanding of
how the kernel works are not likely to remain maintainers for very long.
<p>

So the broadening of the kernel development community - and the associated
need for more work by subsystem maintainers - is not really costing us our
best developers.  They are not "losing the will to code."  The things that
cost us developers are elsewhere: a somewhat adversarial process which
turns off some people, general burnout, or getting a job which takes their
attention away from contributing to the community.  All very normal stuff.
In the Linux kernel community we may have our share of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogbert">Dogberts</a>, but we 
need not lose much sleep over the threat of pointy-haired subsystem
maintainers bringing the process to a halt.  Instead, they have helped the
kernel development process to 
scale to a level beyond that of almost any other software development
project anywhere; that is a good thing, not a sign of trouble.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      This movement towards code-review (and one might add, giving direction<br>
to the various kernel sub-projects) by people as they grow older has<br>
a natural counterpart in the academic world. As academicians get<br>
more senior they take on projects with broader scope and do a lot of<br>
"editorial work".<br>
<p>
This leads some science-writers to conclude (erroneously) that the<br>
best research is only done by young people. Tell that to Andrew Wiles<br>
who put the keystone into the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem at the<br>
age of 39/40.<br>
<p>
I believe we can expect great stuff still to come from our ever-young<br>
kernel hackers.<br>

      It's not unsurprising in fact that external attendees simply do not understand the amazing *success* of that development project (as well as some others in our field btw). Please correct me if you think I'm wrong, but IMHO this kind of success has something to do with people capable and willing to use a modern direct and personal communication tool (the network) for their work (and certainly improving the tool while using it).<br>
Imagine what kind of productivity and innovation improvement could emerge of *actual* application of the same stubborn individual advances to other areas (finance, law enforcement, public administration, manufacturing)... I am not so surprised that so many people do not want to understand what their (lack of?) role could be in such a future. (Note that I do not count among those that counts so I hope I am no biased; except by looking for more reasons to hope for my children future.)<br>

      Missing here, is that the top-level maintainer also contribute to code outside of the kernel. Linus is putting a lot of work into Git still (such as the large contribution of submodules recently). IIRC gregkh is putting stuff into udev as well as the -stable series. Morton has -mm.<br>

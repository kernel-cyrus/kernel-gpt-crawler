Observers of the kernel's commit stream or mailing lists will have seen a
certain amount of traffic referring to the addition of SPDX license
identifiers to kernel 
source files.  For many, this may be their first encounter with SPDX.  But
the SPDX effort has been going on for some years; this article describes
SPDX, along with why and how the kernel community intends to use it.
<p>
On its face, compliance with licenses like the GPL seems like a
straightforward task.  But it quickly becomes complicated for a company
that is shipping a wide range of software, in various versions, in a whole
set of different products.  Compliance problems often come about not
because a given company wants to flout a license, but instead because
that company has lost track of which licenses it needs to comply with and
for which versions of which software.  SPDX has
its roots in <a href="/Articles/370308/">an effort that began in 2009</a>
to help companies get a 
handle on what their compliance obligations actually are.
<p>
It can be surprisingly hard to determine which licenses apply to a given
repository full of software.  The kernel's COPYING file states that it can
be distributed under the terms of version&nbsp;2 of the GNU General Public
License.  But many of the source files within the kernel tell a different
story; some are BSD licensed, and many are dual-licensed.  Some carry an
exception to make it clear that user-space programs are not a derived
product of the kernel.  Occasionally,
files with GPL-incompatible licenses have been found (and fixed).
<p>

A great many files in the kernel source tree carry no license text at all.
One might presume that these files are covered by GPLv2 but, as we'll see,
the situation may not be quite that simple.  No-license files are also
problematic because the <a
href="https://developercertificate.org/">Developer Certificate of
Origin</a>, which governs contributions to the kernel, refers explicitly to
"<q>the open source license indicated in the file</q>".  If there
<i>is</i> no license indicated in the file, the meaning of that phrase is
not entirely clear.

<p>
Another complicating factor is that the license text in kernel source files, when
it is present at all, is entirely free-form.  There are hundreds of
variants of the GPLv2 text alone.  That can make it  hard for human readers
to figure out what's going on, but it is even more challenging for
software.  It is not currently possible to run a tool on the kernel
repository (or that of many other projects) and get a definitive list of
the operative licenses.
<p>
The <a href="https://spdx.org/">Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)</a>
standard is an attempt to address this aspect of the licensing problem.
This effort, which has come under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation's
compliance program, has defined a way to declare licensing information that
is intended to be easily read by both humans and machines.  At its core,
SPDX defines a single-line string to specify the license governing a file.
It looks something like:
<p>
<pre>
    SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
</pre>
<p>
There is <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">a long list of known
licenses</a> and the ability to add extra conditions or exceptions where
needed.  If each file in a repository contains one of these strings,
summing up the licensing information for the repository as a whole becomes
a straightforward affair.
<p>
SPDX has been <a href="/Articles/568286/">adopted</a> in various parts of
the industry in recent years.
The effort to add SPDX identifiers to the kernel has been playing out,
mostly in private, for at least a couple of years.  It recently surfaced in
the form of <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ead751507de86d90fa250431e9990a8b881f713c">a
huge patch set</a> adding SPDX identifiers to over 12,000 kernel 
source files that did not have any license information at all, and as
<a href="/Articles/738235/">a brief discussion</a> at the 2017
Maintainers Summit.  Somewhat
later, <a href="/Articles/738809/">some documentation</a> on the project
surfaced.  Fully documenting the kernel with SPDX tags will take a while,
but the process is well underway at this point.
<p>
For kernel source files, the decision was made that the SPDX tag should
appear as the first line in the file (or the second line for scripts where
the first line must be the <tt>#!</tt> string).  For normal C source files,
the string will be a comment using the "<tt>//</tt>" syntax; header files,
instead, use traditional (<tt>/*&nbsp;*/</tt>) comments for reasons related
to tooling.  Thus, for example, if one looks at <a
href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.14/source/arch/alpha/include/uapi/asm/a.out.h"><tt>arch/alpha/include/uapi/asm/a.out.h</tt></a>,
one will see at the top:
<p>
<pre>
    /* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note */
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>WITH</tt> string says that the kernel's user-space exception
applies to this file, since it defines part of the system-call ABI.
<p>
Kernel developers are often short of patience for things that look like
bureaucratic exercises, so it would not have been surprising to see some
opposition to this project.  In truth, there has been little.  The biggest
issue would appear to be that some of the no-license files that were marked
as GPLv2 <a href="/Articles/739190/">should maybe carry a different
license</a>.  One could argue that this kind of disagreement is a good
thing, in that it points out a place where the license applying to a
specific file was not what most people might expect.  Once this kind of
problem comes to light, it can be addressed.
<p>
The plan is to eventually have SPDX tags in all kernel source files, but
that process could take some time.  For each file that already carries a
license text, somebody has to look and ensure that the SPDX tag matches
that text exactly.  Given that there are around 60,000 files in the kernel
repository, that's a fair amount of work.  An additional goal is to
eventually get rid of the other license texts; the consensus seems to be
that the SPDX identifier is a sufficient declaration of the license on its
own.  But removing license text from source files must be done with a great
deal of care, so it may be a long time before anybody works up the courage
to attempt that on any files that they do not themselves own the copyright
for.
<p>
It would not be surprising to see the process of adding SPDX tags extend
over years.  There will likely be an occasional flare-up as this work
uncovers files with ambiguous or uncertain licensing, but that should
result in more clarity around the licensing of the kernel as a whole once
things are worked out.  At the end, perhaps we'll know what the kernel's
license story really is.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

SPDX license identifiers are generally insufficient for license compliance.  They an important first step in the process of identifying whether compliance is possible, and categorizing what types of obligations compliance carries, but it doesn't help with the actual process of compliance.<br>
<p>
Most open source licenses carry a requirement that you distribute the exact license text for the work with the work.  Simply saying "this is under the MIT license" is inadequate.  Distributing a template MIT license is inadequate. Distributing the exact text of the MIT license file provided by the copyright holders (generally containing one or more copyright statements) is what's required.  Without the means to locate and collate the obligatory license files, compliance is difficult, expensive, and easy to get wrong.<br>
<p>
tl;dr: I really hope that once they get these license identifiers into files, they don't say "yay, we did it!" and stop.  In many instances they'll need to either annotate the source with the full text of each original license, or provide the path to each of those original licenses in the source tree.<br>

I don't understand how that system will work.<br>
<p>
There could be 12 files, each under the license with the SPDX identifier "BSD-2-Clause", but each of those 12 could (and likely would) have different copyright statements or other additional text.  So if they all reference a file named "BSD-2-Clause", how will the correct variant of the data be included?  "cat foo1/LICENSE.txt foo2/LICENSE.txt foo3/LICENSE.txt ... &gt; BSD-2-Clause" probably follows the letter of the license terms, but not the spirit because there's no way to know which entry in that file corresponds with a specific source file.<br>

<p>
The SPDX identifier "BSD-2-Clause" refers *explicitly* to the BSD 2-clause "Simplified" License [1]. If the licence text differs, you use a different SPDX identifier. The SPDX Licence List [2] currently contain 15 BSD licence variants, and more can be added as needed.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;&gt; If the licence text differs, you use a different SPDX identifier.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The license variants cover the different *terms* of the license, not the variations in copyright statement, nor will they ever.</font><br>
<p>
True, but the problem with the BSD licences are that the *terms* of the licence differs depending on the copyright holder (as the original BSD licence explicitly mentioned "University of California, Berkeley" and other copyright holders replaced that with their own name when they released code under an equivalent license).<br>
<p>
For example, the *only* difference between the *terms* of BSD-2-Clause and BSD-2-Clause-NetBSD are these two phrases:<br>
<p>
(1) "THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS" &lt;-&gt; "THE NETBSD FOUNDATION, INC."<br>
(2) "THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER" &lt;-&gt; "THE FOUNDATION"<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;&gt; Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;Templatized or boilerplate copies of the license are insufficient to meet this requirement.</font><br>
<p>
Obviously using SPDX to *identify* the licence does not absolve you of the responsibility to also *comply* with the license. But SPDX license identifiers *can* make it easier to do so.<br>
<p>
Consider the following hypothetical project of 5 source files. Note that file01.c and file02.c have different copyright holders and thus different copyright notices, but both are under the same licence, so you only need one copy of the license *terms* (located in the file LICENSE.BSD-2-Clause). However, file03.c is copied from NetBSD and are thus under a slightly different license. Therefore it does not only uses a different copyright notice, but also a different SPDX license identifier and a separate copy of the license terms (this time located in LICENSE.BSD-2-Clause-NetBSD). Note that LICENSE.BSD-2-Clause and LICENSE.BSD-2-Clause-NetBSD only differs by 4 words, but (as you said) some sort of template would not actually comply with either license, and you therefore need to carry both versions. Next is file04.c which is copied from FreeBSD, which is under another slightly different license, and thus a third SPDX license identifier and a third license file. And finally we have file05.c which contains parts copied from NetBSD, parts copied from FreeBSD, and parts written by me, which means that to use this file you need to comply with both the NetBSD license and the FreeBSD license (which fortunately are compatible with each other, you just need to keep both license files around to comply with both of them at the same time). All in total there are 5 source files with a total of 6 copyright notices, but thanks to the SPDX license identifiers we only need one copy each of the 3 license terms.<br>

I'm just going to stop here, because we clearly got different guidance from our corporate copyright lawyers.<br>
<p>
I will say that the policy we enacted based on that guidance is very similar to the policies of all the other corporations I've worked with, as well as a wide range of products I've used.  I will also direct you to SPDX's own documentation for producing SDPX distribution notices: <a href="https://spdx.org/sites/cpstandard/files/pages/files/spdx-tr-2017-1.pdf">https://spdx.org/sites/cpstandard/files/pages/files/spdx-...</a><br>

Of course adding the SPDX short identifiers into the code is not a cure-all, but it is a massive step forward for clarity. Especially in a code-base as huge as the Linux kernel.<br>

As for general best practices on copyright and license info, have you checked &lt;<a href="https://reuse.software/">https://reuse.software/</a>&gt; yet?<br>

Suffering from a coirporate policy that requires a full assessment process for software that contains Open Source components I'm glad to see those SPDX identifiers show up in the kernel. Next step would be to include them as well in all userland software. But yet they are very rare, just download some sources of popular programs and go hunting for SPDX and you won't find much.<br>
<p>
If there would be a valid SPDX tag everywhere it would make automation of our ugly process easier. Currently we sometimes invest more effort in the bureaucratic and legally required stuff than in actually developing software. <br>

One could also take a look at the Debian DEP5 proposal (<a href="http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep5/">http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep5/</a>) and the machine-readable debian/copyright format (<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/">https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-fo...</a>).

I'm having trouble understanding who exactly this is useful to.<br>
<p>
Anything in the kernel source tree should be available under GPLv2.  So I guess the only reason you'd care about the license on individual files is if you want to incorporate some portion into a more liberally-licensed project?  Are there that many of those projects?  I must be missing something.<br>

SPDX is one of the few universally good ideas I've seen for metadata. Perl 6 switched everything to it earlier this year too; turns out it's much easier to get everyone to agree on a common shorthand for licenses than it is to make everyone use, say, SemVer. In an ecosystem role like that it nudges people away from ad-hoc license proliferation, which is probably a good thing.<br>
<p>
I'm not so much a fan of its standalone metadata file format, but I don't think I'm ever going to find a package metadata format that's good - they all gradually expand until they reimplement half of X.509.<br>

      It seems a shame that these identifiers are written as comments. With appropriate macro definitions you could have

<pre>
    #include "spdx.h"

    SPDX_LICENCE_IDENTIFIER("GPL-2.0")
</pre>

And with appropriate definitions, the licence information could be propagated into object and executable files too. This would be useful, as it takes effort to establish which source files have been used in a build, and therefore which licences apply to your binaries.

It's a common idea, but it doesn't really work well for .h files.<br>
<p>
Also, what happens when you combine multiple .c files into a single .o file?<br>
<p>
It gets messy very quickly, we tried it.  Hence the fall-back to a comment, which works out much better<br>

It works even less well for languages other than C and languages that have nothing like the preprocessor -- but almost any language you can name has comments.<br>

So where is the actual meaning of "Linux-syscall-note" defined?<br>

To be clear, I'm aware of the note about syscall use in the kernel. What I'm wondering is where the SPDX notation makes the link between that exception identifier and its expansion.<br>

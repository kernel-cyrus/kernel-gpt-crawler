</div>
Optimizing the kernel's memory use is made much easier if developers have
an accurate idea of how memory is being used, but the kernel's
instrumentation is not as good as it could be.  When Suren Baghdasaryan and
Kent Overstreet <a href="/Articles/932402/">presented</a> their
memory-allocation profiling work, which is meant to address this
shortcoming, at the 2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and
BPF Summit, their objective was uncontroversial but the proposed solution
ran into opposition that played out at length on the mailing lists (<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20240212213922.783301-1-surenb@google.com/">example</a>)
over the last year.  So it may be a bit surprising that, when the two
returned to the memory-management track in the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 gathering</a>, the
controversy was gone and the discussion focused on improving details of the
implementation.
<p>
As a review: the allocation-profiling work tracks all allocations of memory
in the kernel and maps them back to the code that performed the allocation.
It can be used to see where memory is being used and to track down memory
leaks.  The profiling, in turn, relies on <a href="/Articles/906660/">code
tagging</a>, which inserts special structures into the code allowing
locations to be identified.  Both features are new to the mainline kernel.

<p>
<a href="/Articles/974382/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/lsfmm/SurenBaghdasaryan-sm.png" alt="[Suren
Baghdasaryan]" title="Suren Baghdasaryan" class="rthumb"></a>

Baghdasaryan started by saying that the patch set had been accepted into
the mm-stable tree and was poised to go upstream into the mainline (that
has since happened in the 6.10 merge window).  The discussion on whether
this code should be merged was over, so it was time to talk about what
comes next.
<p>
The main topic was reducing the memory and performance overhead of the
profiling mechanism.  If it is enabled, it consumes about 0.2% of the
system's total memory — enough to be concerned about.  It turns out that
almost all of that overhead is in the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.1/source/include/linux/page_ext.h#L45"><tt>page_ext</tt>
structures</a> used to hold the back pointer from a page of memory to the
tag identifying the code where it was allocated.  That pointer is used to
decrement the associated counters when the page is freed.  On the
performance side, allocation profiling makes page allocations 40% slower,
and has a smaller, 7%&nbsp;impact on slab allocations.
<p>
One way of reducing that overhead would be to pack the code-tag references,
of which there are 4-5,000 in the kernel.  With some care, there is no need
to use a 64-bit pointer for each.  Instead, the references could be made
smaller and, possibly, packed into the page flags, eliminating the need for
the <tt>page_ext</tt> structure and reducing the allocation overhead.  On
the other hand, this approach would introduce complications with loadable
modules, Baghdasaryan said.  The group then spent a while discussing
possible linker tricks to solve that problem without reaching any specific
conclusions.
<p>
Assuming the loadable-module problem can be solved, the
allocation-profiling code would store 16-bit references rather than 64-bit
ones, resulting in a 75% reduction in the memory used — for page
allocations.  The overhead for <i>slab</i> allocations actually increases
to 9.5%, though, suggesting that perhaps those references should not be
packed.  But if that 16-bit reference can be crammed into the page flags,
then the memory overhead goes away completely and the performance overhead
at allocation time goes from 40% to&nbsp;7%.  Without this additional step,
he said, the packed references are not worth the extra complexity cost.
<p>
John Hubbard was the one to ask a question that was likely on the mind of
many of the developers in the room: is it really possible to find
16&nbsp;free page flags to use for this purpose?  Page flags have <a
href="/Articles/787338/">long been in short supply</a>, and developers have
<a href="/Articles/335768/">had to fight hard</a> to use even a single one
of them.  There was not a clear answer to that question.  Pasha Tatashin
suggested that perhaps fewer than 16&nbsp;bits would suffice for 5,000
references.  There followed a winding discussion on the kernel
configurations used by various distributions, their effect on the
availability of page flags, and whether any of them could be changed, that
did not reach any specific conclusions
<p>

<a href="/Articles/974384/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/lsfmm/KentOverstreet-sm.png" alt="[Kent
Overstreet]" title="Kent Overstreet" class="rthumb"></a>


Tatashin said that it would be nice to have the ability to selectively
enable and disable tags to, for example, avoid slowing down a critical
network driver while profiling allocations in an unrelated subsystem.  He
would also like to separate accounted and unaccounted allocations; the
latter, which are not charged to any specific process, represent pure
overhead imposed by the kernel.  Overstreet answered that the profiling
could show the allocation flags used along with other information, but also
asked whether it might not be better to just turn on accounting for all
allocations.  He acknowledged that accounting would have to be made cheaper
for that to be an option.
<p>
The allocation-profiling subsystem's path into the kernel was eased by the
dropping of a number of features that it had initially included.  Now the
developers would like to bring some of those back, Baghdasaryan said.
These include capturing more information about allocation context and
dynamic fault injection (which wasn't discussed in the session; this
feature allows allocation failures to be injected into specific code paths
to test error handling).  Some sort
of selection mechanism, as requested by Tatashin earlier, is also on the
list.  Overstreet closed the session by saying that interest in allocation
profiling (and code tags) is increasing, and that some interesting
uses that he had never thought of were emerging.  <br clear="all"><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Was there any mention of off-line tagging with no per-block space cost, perhaps like <a href="https://milianw.de/tag/heaptrack">heaptrack</a> does for malloc+free in user mode?  Send the address, size, timestamp, and traceback identifier into a pipe for later (or concurrent) analysis.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 24, 2019</br>
           </div>
Technologies like UEFI secure boot are intended to guarantee that a
locked-down system is running the software intended by its owner (for a
definition of "owner" as "whoever holds the signing key recognized by the
firmware").  That guarantee is hard to uphold, though, if a program run on
the system in question is able to modify the running kernel somehow.  Thus,
proponents of secure-boot technologies have been trying for years to
provide the ability to lock
down many types of kernel functionality on secure systems.  The latest
attempt posted by Matthew Garrett, at an eyebrow-raising <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190622000358.19895-1-matthewgarrett@google.com/">version&nbsp;34</a>,
tries to address previous concerns by putting lockdown under the control of
a Linux security module (LSM).
<p>
The lockdown patches have a long and controversial history; LWN first <a
href="/Articles/514985/">wrote about them</a> in 2012.  Opposition has come
at all kinds of levels; some developers see lockdown as a way of taking
control of systems away from their owners, while others see it as ultimately
useless security theater.  There does appear to be some value, though, in
making a system as resistant to compromise as possible, so these patches
have persisted and are often shipped by distributors.  Disagreement over
more recent versions of the lockdown patch set were focused on details like
<a href="/Articles/751061/">whether lockdown should be tied to the presence
of secure boot</a> or <a href="/Articles/784674/">integration</a> with the
integrity-measurement infrastructure.
<p>
One outcome from the most recent discussion was a concern that the lockdown
patches were wiring too much policy into the kernel itself.  The kernel has
long had a mechanism for pushing security-policy decisions out to user
space — the 
security-module mechanism.  So it arguably makes sense to move lockdown
decision-making into an LSM; that is indeed what the more recent versions
of the patch set do.
<p>
First, though, there is the problem of initialization.  LSMs exist to apply
policies to actions taken by user space, so as long as the LSM
infrastructure is running by the time user space starts, everything is
fine.  Lockdown, though, must act earlier: it needs to be able to block
the action of certain types of command-line parameters and must be
functional even before a security policy can be loaded.  So the patch set
starts by creating a new type of "early security module" that is
initialized toward the beginning of the boot process.  At this point, the
module can't do much — even basic amenities like <tt>kmalloc()</tt> are not
available — but it's enough to register its hooks and take control.
<p>
Next, a new security hook is provided for LSMs to use:
<p>
<pre>
    int (*locked_down)(enum lockdown_reason what);
</pre>
<p>
This hook allows the LSM to decide whether kernel lockdown will prohibit a
given action, described by <tt>what</tt>.  Actions include loading unsigned
modules (<tt>LOCKDOWN_MODULE_SIGNATURE</tt>), access to special files like
<tt>/dev/port</tt> (<tt>LOCKDOWN_DEV_MEM</tt>), hibernating the system
(<tt>LOCKDOWN_HIBERNATION</tt>), use of many perf functions
(<tt>LOCKDOWN_PERF</tt>), kernel tracing (<tt>LOCKDOWN_TRACEFS</tt>), some
BPF function (<tt>LOCKDOWN_BPF_READ</tt>), and many more.  There are, it
turns out, a lot of ways for root to compromise or extract information from
the kernel; the lockdown patches do their best to close them all off.
<p>
In the previous version of the patch, Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CALCETrVUwQP7roLnW6kFG80Cc5U6X_T6AW+BTAftLccYGp8+Ow@mail.gmail.com/">objected</a>
to the provision of detailed actions to LSM <tt>locked_down()</tt> hooks.
He argued, instead, for simply providing two values: "confidentiality" (for
actions that may leak information from the kernel) and "integrity" (for
those that could compromise the kernel).  Doing anything else, he said,
risks problems in the future if the meaning of any of those actions expands
or changes.  Garrett <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CACdnJuv2sePuGBtTM6UL4S2k1UATcAk517o6vPx2EWF0Uxt8iw@mail.gmail.com/">thought
the extra information could be useful</a>, though, and was less worried
about incompatible changes.  So this feature remains in the current patch
set.
<p>
The patch set does maintain the distinction between confidentiality and
integrity lockdown, though.  The various <tt>LOCKDOWN_*</tt> constants are
ordered so that the integrity-related actions have lower values than those
related to confidentiality.  All of the integrity-related actions have
values less than <tt>LOCKDOWN_INTEGRITY_MAX</tt>; all actions of any type
have lower values than <tt>LOCKDOWN_CONFIDENTIALITY_MAX</tt>.  So a module
that wants to distinguish between the two types of actions can do so using
a simple comparison and
without needing to understand each action specifically.
<p>
That feature is used by the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190622000358.19895-4-matthewgarrett@google.com/">static
lockdown policy module</a> added by the patch set.  While some users may
want to put together complex LSM policies regarding lockdown, many others
are likely to simply want to lock down everything and be done with it.  The
static policy module enables that in a number of ways, depending on how the
kernel is configured.  There is a <tt>lockdown=</tt> command-line parameter
that can be set to either <tt>integrity</tt> or <tt>confidentiality</tt> to
enable lockdown, which can also be turned on at run time via the
<tt>/sys/kernel/security/lockdown</tt> sysfs knob.  There are also, though,
kernel configuration options to simply force either lockdown mode with no
option for it to be disabled.
<p>
Over the years, the lockdown patches have proved to be highly
controversial.  There are certainly still developers who are unconvinced by
or opposed to the concept, but it seems that most of the objections have
been addressed through years of patient reworking of the patch set.  One
can never be sure that 34 revisions will be enough until the code lands in
the mainline kernel, but the odds seem relatively good that this long story
is finally approaching an end.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I think we've seen enough vulnerabilities around this sort of software (Intel ME, AMD's PSP) that we can be sure that running a ten-year-old lockdown LSM is unlikely to be useful.

<p>I think using a word like "owner" to mean "whoever holds the signing key" is a twisting of the facts at best (as evidenced by the way that "owner" is used in the next paragraph down); and that we should refuse to play along with this misleading terminology.
<p>Something more neutral like "lockholder" or "keymaster" would be more accurate:  "Technologies like UEFI secure boot are intended to guarantee that a locked-down system is running software intended by the lockholder" is perfectly understandable, and clues the reader in to the fact that the "lockholder" may or may not be the actual owner of the device.

I agree. The person holding the device signing keys is the de facto owner of the device—as in the one with the ability to exercise the rights of the owner with respect to the device. This is much more relevant than whoever the de jure owner might be. I would go so far as to say that claiming to sell a device while withholding the device's signing keys and not transferring control to the new de jure owner is an example of fraud. The sale has not been completed until full control of the device has been transferred to the new owner.<br>

Agreed. I think attempting to use "neutral" terminology here disguises the fact that such systems are sometimes used as an instrument of power over the user.<br>
<p>
See also game consoles, where manufacturers like to say that the software lockdown is a security measure. It's security for the manufacturer, not for the user.<br>

<p>
So you are in favor of confusing at least 99.5% of all people in the world about what this feature does?   The only people who will understand what is written as you do will be people who have followed this discussion (mostly security geeks and Linux kernel programmers).  The alternative wording will be understood by everyone who understand your preferred wording or at least will clue in people who aren't monitoring this discussion that this feature might not do what they want.<br>
<p>
And if we are going to be pedantic about it, I would point out that it is likely that &gt;99.5% of the legal "owners" of the systems in question will not in fact be "keyholders"; so your wording is false using the more widely understood legal meaning.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 10, 2016</br>
           <hr>

</div>
Casey Schaufler started off his <a
href="http://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au</a> 2016 talk by noting that
a prospective security-module author may be told that writing a new module
is not necessarily a good idea.  They'll hear that we already have a good
selection of security modules, or it can all be done with SELinux anyway and,
besides, kernel programming is hard.  But, he said, there are indeed good
reasons for wanting to write a new security module; he was there to discuss
those reasons and give some guidance for those unfamiliar with this part of
the kernel.
<p>
So why might one want to write a new security module?  Our current modules,
he said, are showing their age; they follow <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%E2%80%93LaPadula_model">a
design</a> that dates from a time when users
actually sat in a computer room to do their work.  These modules are a poor
fit to the concerns we have now; they were not designed with systems like
smartphones in 
mind.  We need to start working on ideas that don't date from the era of
paper tape.  And, in any case, there <i>are</i> things that cannot be done
with SELinux.
<p>
It is important to understand what security modules can do.  They are a way
to add new restrictive controls to operations that a process might try to
perform; they cannot replace the existing discretionary access control
checks, which will be done anyway.  Thus, they offer a new opportunity to
say "no" to an operation, but they cannot authorize an action that the user
would not have otherwise been able to perform.
<p>
There are a few basic rules to bear in mind when contemplating a new
security module.  The first of those is to avoid duplicating existing
modules.  If SELinux can do what you need, you're better off joining its
community and pushing things in the direction that you need.  Another rule
is to not rely heavily on user-space helpers.  There is a proprietary
module out there, he said, that asks user space to make the actual security
decisions.  This solution is inefficient and provides a hook for
proprietary code; either reason would be enough to keep it from ever going
upstream.  Remember that you're playing in kernel space, so try not to
upset the kernel developers; he named Al Viro in particular as one not to
inflame.
<p>
The most important rule, though, is to plagiarize freely from other
security modules; don't reinvent things that already exist and work.  When
he wrote <a href="/Articles/244531/">Smack</a>, he took a lot of things
from SELinux.  That, he said, is how we do things in the Linux community.
<p>
<h4>How security modules work</h4>
<p>
Casey started into the mechanics of security modules by talking about the
hooks that they rely on.  There are function calls scattered around the
kernel that exist to give security modules a chance to make a decision on a
specific action; their names all start with "<tt>security_</tt>".  Modules
use these hooks to do
access checks and perform general data management; it is
only necessary to write the hooks that are relevant to the task at hand.
Following normal kernel conventions, hooks return zero for success
(generally allowing the requested operation); <tt>EACCES</tt> should be
used to indicate a policy denial, while <tt>EPERM</tt> means that a
necessary privilege is missing.
<p>
Many (or most) hooks are object-based, in that they relate to a specific
object in kernel space.  Hooks often deal with <tt>inode</tt> structures,
for example, since those structures represent files within the kernel.  Some
hooks, though, work with pathnames instead.  Paths are more
human-friendly, since that's how people deal with files, but they may not
uniquely identify the underlying object (files can have more than one name,
for example).
<p>
"Security blobs" are data structures attached to objects by a security
module.  One will often see the terms <tt>secctx</tt>, which refers to a
text string associated with a blob, and <tt>secid</tt>, a 32-bit ID number
for a blob.  There are two types of modules, called "major" and "minor,"
with the difference being that major modules use blobs.  There can only be

<a href="/Articles/674955/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2016/lca/CaseySchaufler-sm.jpg" alt="[Casey Schaufler]"
title="Casey Schaufler" border=0 hspace=3 width=200 height=250
align="left"></a>

one major module active in the kernel, and it runs after any other
module.  There is no mechanism, yet, for sharing the security-blob pointers
between modules; Casey allowed as to how fixing that is an <a
href="/Articles/518345/">ongoing crusade</a> of his.  Minor modules, thus,
have no blobs and don't maintain any per-object state.  They run after the
discretionary checks, but before the major module, if one exists.
<p>

There are some questions that should be answered before attempting to
design a new security module, starting with: what resource is to be
protected by the module?  If you can't answer that, Casey said, you're not
thinking about security.  Answers might be files created by a particular
user, or specific paths within the filesystem, or one might want to
protect specific processes from each other.
<p>
That leads to the second question: what is that resource to be protected
from?  Traditionally, security has been based around users, but now we
think about things like malicious apps.  So, rather than protecting users
from each other, we're now concerned with protecting Facebook's data from
Netflix.
<p>
Finally, a security-module developer needs to know how that protection will
be done.  The traditional answer is to simply deny access to unauthorized
users, but other approaches are possible.  Logging of such attempts is
often done, of course.  One could consider more wide-ranging changes, such
as changing the ownership of a file to match the last user who wrote to it
via group access.
<p>
<h4>Various details</h4>
<p>
Security modules can make information available under <tt>/proc</tt>.  One
should, however, resist the temptation to reuse the attribute names already
used by SELinux; a new security module should make its own names.
<p>
Objects contain numerous attributes that can be used by a security module;
these include ownership, access mode, object types and sizes, etc.  Modules
can use them any way they like, but they should not change their
fundamental meaning.  The user ID should not identify the application, as
"a certain system" has done.  Security modules can make decisions based on
pathnames if that works best, though the interface to pathnames inside
the kernel is not the most convenient.
<p>
With regard to networking, Casey said, there may not be much for a
security-module developer to do.  Linux has the netfilter subsystem that
can make all kinds of access-control decisions; that approach should always
be tried first.  If a module must be written, there are hooks for various
socket operations, and for packet delivery as well.  The
<tt>SO_PEERSEC</tt> socket operation can be used to pass security
attributes to another process.  Working with Unix-domain sockets is easy,
he said, because the security module has access to both ends of the
connection.  Internet sockets are harder, since only one end is available.
The <a href="/Articles/204905/">CIPSO</a> mechanism can be used to send
attributes across a link; support 
for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5570">CALIPSO</a>, which will
make similar functionality available under IPv6, is coming.
<p>
Casey suggested that modules probably want to log access denials, to help
with policy debugging if nothing else.  Helpful stuff can be found in
<tt>&lt;linux/lsm_audit.h&gt;</tt>.  The actual data to be logged is up to
the module author; various utilities are available for formatting that data
in user space.
<p>
Non-trivial modules probably need control interfaces; administrators will
want to be able to change access rules, look at statistics, and more.
Casey advised against adding new <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls or system calls;
instead, a virtual filesystem should be created.  A call to
<tt>sysfs_create_mount_point()</tt> makes that easy; he recommended
borrowing the relevant code from an existing module.
<p>
Finally, what about stacking of security modules?  At this point, stacking of
minor modules is easy and supported, but there can only be one major module
at a time, since there is only one security-blob pointer.  There is, he
said, a way to cheat on systems where the kernel is built from source:
simply add the new security blob to the SELinux blob.  Work is in progress
to allow multiple major modules, but they cannot be supported now.
<p>
In the end, Casey said, anybody looking to write a security module should
have a good reason for doing it.  Some stuff, after all, really does belong
in user space.  If you write a module, do it properly: provide
documentation and support the code.  Don't reinvent the wheel; generic
security has long since been done, show us something new instead.  Nobody
has done a good application resource-management security policy, for
example.  There is interesting potential around policies tied to the
sensors found on current devices.  Security, he said, does not have to be
dull.

Every time I hear about this, I'm repeatedly amazed how people see this as a good thing.<br>
<p>
To me it looks like the second most braindead decision in the LSM community, after SELinux.<br>

I disagree - fundamentally, this is a design decision that the system as a whole *must* "fail closed", providing protection *no worse* than before it was enabled.<br>
<p>
If one wishes to completely ignore DAC, then one may simply chmod -R a=rwX /remount/of/filesystem (modulo the work needed to patch software to allow itself to run in such a system without complaining about the insecure mode bits, and to make udev rules and the like not try to set ownership and access)<br>

Yet it does exactly the OPPOSITE!! Turning SELinux _off_ makes a system more permissive.<br>
<p>
Maybe for some people it's tempting to do "chmod -R 777 /" and hope that SELinux will limit the damage. I would prefer to do the opposite: chmod -R 000 /" and then use LSMs to grant additional permissions on a need-to-know basis.<br>
<p>
Consequently, since SELinux's only visible effect is for systems to fail in various interesting places, pretty much every troubleshooting guide starts with "turn SELinux off".<br>

That is not what I meant by "fail closed"<br>
<p>
I mean that a misconfiguration of the complex system (SELinux) must-not reduce the security of the system relative to the baseline (POSIX mode bits).<br>
<p>
If they worked the way you are suggesting, turning on SELinux before a policy is set up would, instantly, have the same effect as chmod'ing everything 0777.<br>

That is "failing open"<br>

Incorrect. If SELinux could be used to grant access instead of restrict it, it would have been easy to design it to default to "disable".<br>
<p>
Network firewalls are a good example. Firewall rules can grant access, but it's considered to be a good practice to start your rules with "deny any" and then add more specific "allow" rules.<br>

<h1>USB device authorization</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted July 17, 2007 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Universal serial bus (USB) devices do not normally have much of a security
model associated with them.  If a user is able to plug a USB device into
the system, said system assumes that the device is properly authorized to
be there.  There are situations where the connection of USB device causes
people to worry; the usual scenario is the fear of corporate secrets being
copied into some sort of USB storage device and being carried out of the
building.  In general, in situations where such fears run strong, the
response has involved (attempted) bans of USB devices or simply filling the
USB ports of accessible computers with glue.
<p>

Wireless USB changes the situation slightly.  This protocol allows USB
devices to operate remotely, without that pesky cable to trip over; it can
be thought of as occupying a niche similar to that of Bluetooth.  While a
typical laptop user might be expected to notice an attacker plugging a
normal USB keyboard into their system, said attacker could attempt to
connect a wireless USB keyboard without coming near.  Clearly, some sort of
security layer is required.  The <a
href="http://www.usb.org/developers/wusb/">wireless USB specification</a>
has anticipated this need; it provides for a whole series of acronym-laden
techniques for (1)&nbsp;ensuring that both hosts and devices authenticate
themselves to each other, and (2)&nbsp;that wireless USB communications are
sufficiently well encrypted that they cannot be eavesdropped upon.
<p>

I&ntilde;aky Perez-Gonzalez is working on wireless USB support for Linux.  He has
come to the conclusion that the grungy details of wireless USB
authentication belong in user space; the kernel cannot, on its own, keep
track of which devices are known to the system and are allowed to connect.  It
is, however, up to the kernel to implement the authorization part of the
equation: a wireless USB device which is not authorized should not be able
to perform any sort of exchange with the host system.  I&ntilde;aky's response to
the authorization problem is <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/241894/">this
set of patches</a> to the USB subsystem.
<p>

These patches add three new flags to the <tt>usb_device</tt> structure:
<tt>wusb</tt>, <tt>authorized</tt>, and <tt>authenticated</tt>.  The first
indicates that a device is  wireless, and the last (which is not
yet used) indicates that the device has passed authentication.  In the
middle is the <tt>authorized</tt> flag which indicates whether it is OK to
talk to the device.  If the device is not authorized, the kernel will not even read
its configuration to find the endpoints it provides; the only thing that
can happen at that point is authentication.  To that end, various points in
the USB stack are changed to check the <tt>authorized</tt> flag before
allowing access to a USB device.
<p>

User space is brought into the picture by way of the usual device-attach
announcement and the creation of an associated sysfs tree.  The sysfs
directories for USB devices gain a new <tt>authorized</tt> attribute which
corresponds to the internal flag; user space can enable access to the
device by writing a non-zero value to that attribute.  That infrastructure
is all that is required for some sort of user-space daemon to notice the
arrival of a new wireless USB device, check its database of known devices,
possibly pop up some sort of pairing dialog to the user, and implement a
decision on whether the device should be allowed to connect or not.
<p>

I&ntilde;aky has taken things a step further by realizing that this authorization
mechanism need not be limited to wireless devices; it can, in fact, be used
to allow some sort of management code to pass judgment on any USB device.
There is a set of per-host <tt>authorized_default</tt> flags which can be
configured by the administrator; simply setting the default to zero with no
other action will disallow the connection of any new devices, whether wired
or not.  
<p>

A more complex implementation might allow only certain types of devices to
connect.  Keyboards and mice might be acceptable, but anything which could
remove data from a system - storage devices or printers, say - would be
disallowed.  Or storage devices could be allowed, but only if they contain
some sort of properly signed authorization certificate which can be
verified by the host system.  There are a number of interesting
possibilities.  The resulting security will be less than that which could
be had by filling in the ports or simply configuring USB out of the system
entirely, but it might be just what is needed at some sites.

<p>
Overall, it's a relatively simple patch set which adds some interesting
capabilities.  Much of the hard work - authentication and encryption setup
- remains, but that's a job for user space.  I&ntilde;aky has asked that this code
be merged for 2.6.23; it's just a bit late, though, for a relatively
untested (in the wider world) chunk of code to slip through the merge
window.  2.6.24 seems more likely.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Looks like it could support IEEE 1667 devices, if anyone actually released <br>
them onto the market...<br>

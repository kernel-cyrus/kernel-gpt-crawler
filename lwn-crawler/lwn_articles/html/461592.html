           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 4, 2011</br>
           </div>
High-resolution timers (hrtimers) can be used to invoke kernel code after a
precisely-specified time interval; unlike regular kernel timers, hrtimers
can be reliably used with periods of microseconds or 
nanoseconds.  Even hrtimer users can usually accept a wakeup within a
specific range of times, though.  To take advantage of that fact, the
kernel offers "range hrtimers" with both soft (earliest) and hard (latest)
deadlines.  With range hrtimers, the kernel can coalesce wakeup events,
minimizing the number of interrupts and reducing power usage.  These are
good things, so it is not surprising that the use of range timers has
increased since they were introduced.
<p>
One would think that, once the hrtimer code starts running in response to a
timer interrupt, it would make sense to run every timer event whose soft
expiration time has passed.  But that is not what current kernels do.  It
is an interesting exercise to look at why that is, and how <a
href="/Articles/460523/">a recent patch</a> from Venkatesh Pallipadi
changes that behavior.
<p>
For the sake of simplicity, let us imagine a set of timers that we'll call
"A" through "G", each expiring 10&micro;s after its predecessor.  The
hard expiration times are regular, but the timers have wildly differing
soft expiration times; plotted on a timeline, the example timers look like
this: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/hrtimer-tl.png" width=363 height=188 alt="[Hrtimer
timeline]">
</blockquote>
<p>
As can be seen here, timer "A" has a hard expiration 10&micro;s in the
future, but it could expire any time 
after 5&micro;s.  Timer "B" can be expired anytime from 7.5&micro;s to
20&micro;s in the future; the kernel can thus expire them both at 10&micro;s and
eliminate the need to schedule a timer interrupt at 20&micro;s.  Further in
the future, timer "D" has a hard expiration 40&micro;s
ahead, but it is quite flexible and could, like timer "B", legitimately be
expired 7.5&micro;s from now.
<p>
If the kernel is interrupted by a hardware timer in 10&micro;s, it might be
expected to call the expiration function for timers "A", "B", and "D".  In
reality, though, the expiration function for "D" will not be called at that
time.  To understand why, consider that hrtimers, within the kernel, are
stored in a <a href="/Articles/184495/">red-black tree</a> with the hard
expiration time as the key.  The resulting tree will look something like
this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/hrtimer-tree.png" width=302 height=242 alt="[hrtimer
tree]">
</blockquote>
<p>
When the timer interrupt happens, the timer code performs a depth-first
traversal of this tree for as long as it finds timers whose soft expiration
time has passed.  In this case, it will encounter "A" and "B" but, once it
hits "C", the soft expiration time is in the future and the traversal
stops.  The organization of the data structure is such that the code cannot
find the other events whose soft expiration time has passed without
searching the whole tree.  
<p>
When the hrtimer code was extended to support range timers, searching for
all soft-expired timers looked like it would require the addition of a
second tree over the existing tree.  That was deemed to be too expensive,
especially since it may not actually save any wakeups.  With the current
code, "D" will be expired after 30&micro;s, when "C" hits its hard
expiration.  Expiring "D" sooner will not eliminate the need for a wakeup
at 30&micro;s, so it didn't seem worth the effort to expire "D" sooner.
<p>
Venkatesh thought this through and decided that he could come up with a
couple of exceptions to that reasoning.  It may well be that, at
10&micro;s, the system will be less heavily loaded than at 30&micro;s; in
that case, it makes  sense to get more work done sooner.  Running the
timer sooner also <i>could</i> save a wakeup if "C" is deleted prior to
expiration.  So he wrote up a patch to implement a "greedy hrtimer walk"
that would run all soft-expired hrtimers on a timer interrupt.
<p>
He was helped by the addition of <a href="/Articles/388118/">augmented
red-black trees</a> (also done by Venkatesh) in 2010.  Essentially, an
augmented tree allows the 
addition of a bit of extra metadata to each node; when a change is made to
the tree, that extra information can be percolated upward.  The greedy
hrtimer walk patch turns the hrtimer tree into an augmented red-black tree;
each node then stores the earliest soft expiration time to be found at that
level of the tree or below.  With the timer example given above, the new
tree would look like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/hrtimer-tree-aug.png" width=302 height=242 alt="[hrtimer
tree]">
</blockquote>
<p>
The new numbers in red tell the tree-traversal logic what the soonest
soft-expiration time is in each subtree.  Using those numbers, a search of
the tree 10&micro;s in the future could prune the search at "F", since all
soft expiration times will be known to be at least 25&micro;s further in
the future at that time.  That takes away much of the cost of searching the
tree for soft-expired timers that are not on the left side.
<p>
One might still wonder if that extra work is worthwhile on the off-chance
that running timer events sooner will be advantageous.  After all, in the
absence of specific knowledge or a crystal ball, it is just as likely that
the system will be <i>less</i> loaded at the later expiration time; in that
case, expiring the timer sooner would make things worse. Venkatesh's patch 
avoids that issue by only performing the greedy hrtimer walk if the CPU is
idle when the timer interrupt happens.  If work is being done, soft-expired
timers that are not immediately accessible are left in the tree, but, if
the CPU has nothing better to do, it performs the full search.  
<p>

Venkatesh benchmarked this work by looking at the number of times the
scheduler migrated tasks between CPUs on a given workload.  Migrations are
a sign of contention for the processor; they can also be expensive since
processes can leave their memory cache behind when they move.  Given the
right workload (80% busy with a number of threads), the number of
migrations was cut to just over half its previous value; other workloads
gave less impressive results, but the patch never seemed to hurt.  Given
that, the comments on the patch were mostly focused on the details - like
whether the greedy behavior should be controlled by a sysctl knob or not.

      Great write-up! One minor nitpick: you write "Essentially, an augmented tree allows the addition of a bit of extra metadata to each node; when a change is made to the tree, that extra information can be percolated upward." This is a "bit" confusing, since apparently an entire int worth of extra bits are being added.

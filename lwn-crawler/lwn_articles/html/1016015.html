<h1>Supporting untorn buffered writes</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">

<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2025/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
At last year's
Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF Summit (LSFMM+BPF), there was a <a
href="/Articles/974578/">discussion about atomic writes</a> that was
accompanied by patches to support the feature in the block layer, and for
direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span> on XFS.  That
work was merged, but another piece of that discussion concerned adding the
feature for buffered <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>, in part because the PostgreSQL database currently
has to jump through hoops to ensure that its writes are not "torn"
(partially written) when there is an error or crash.  Luis Chamberlain led
a combined storage and filesystem track at this year's summit to revisit
the idea of providing atomic (or untorn) writes for buffered <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/1016409/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/lsfmb-chamberlain-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5

height=270>
</a>

<p>
Chamberlain suggested that there was a belief that it did not make sense to
work on buffered atomic <span class="nobreak">I/O</span> simply to work
around a missing feature in PostgreSQL; some think that the database should
just support direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>.  It turns out that
the default storage engine for MongoDB supports both buffered and direct
<span class="nobreak">I/O</span>, he said, but MongoDB recommends using
buffered.  The reason is that MongoDB compresses data on disk by default
and keeps the data uncompressed in its cache. The data can be accessed via
<a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>,
which is not compatible with direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>.
</p>


<p>
He thinks that the database developers should be able to decide on the
architecture that works best for their needs.  Providing untorn buffered writes
allows the databases to eliminate the double-buffering they are doing now
as a workaround.  There are configuration options to turn off the
double-buffering for MySQL and PostgreSQL, which can be used to test the
impacts of the change.
</p>

<p>
The atomic-write API could eventually be used by databases to provide the
torn-write prevention, but a prototype can be run without it to verify that
the databases are writing with the correct sizes and alignment needed by
that API.  In his <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRdyZz362oQj9ma0acha6K-n8nmx-jxmy0sxsXdLSIQzh7reALDpH6nG_WXVrkJZeOLW7QCYpKokGit/pub">slides</a>,
Chamberlain showed graphs of running MySQL and PostgreSQL with and without
the double-buffering options.  Both showed higher average transactions per
second, with much less variability, without double-buffering.  To reproduce
these results, Chamberlain recommended using <a
href="https://github.com/dkruces/bcc/blob/lbs/tools/blkalgn.py">blkalgn</a>,
which he called "<q>the bees knees for <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>
atomic-alignment verification and visualization</q>".  The tests are <a
href="https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops/blob/main/docs/sysbench/sysbench.md">integrated
into his kdevops</a> kernel development and testing tool.

<p>
Chamberlain wondered what the next steps might be.  John Garry said that he
thought the testing needed to validate the idea should also be run with
more threads because, at least for MySQL, his testing showed some
contention when multiple threads were writing.  Chamberlain agreed with
that, noting that the tests can easily be run in kdevops, so doing so with
various numbers of threads needs to happen; the tests run for a long time
(12 hours), so he has not yet gotten to further testing.  He said that
various members of the
community will need to do their own homework to decide whether it makes
sense to support the feature; if so, then there is the question of what the
API should be.
</p>

<p>
As Chamberlain had mentioned earlier, Ted Ts'o noted that various large
cloud vendors (hyperscalers) already have hosted MySQL solutions that are
taking advantage of untorn writes.  They are doing so "<q>without any
upstream patches, just auditing code
paths, and it mostly works as long as you are really, really careful</q>".
So he agrees that the community needs to do its homework, but vendors have
made it clear that they see advantages, at least for MySQL and direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>.
</p>

<p>
His main concern regarding atomic buffered <span class="nobreak">I/O</span> is the semantics of the
<tt>RWF_ATOMIC</tt> flag.  The database people only need untorn writes for
8KB, 16KB, and, maybe someday, 32KB sizes, but there is a contingent in
some parts of the filesystem-development community that believes a 1MB
write with the atomic flag should be fully supported.  That would be
painful to do for direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>, but it is exceedingly difficult for buffered
<span class="nobreak">I/O</span>.  The kernel needs to track different atomic-write sizes as they make
their way through the page cache and onto the storage medium.  There may be
"<q>fancy ways to do that [with] large folios and making darn sure you don't
break apart a large folio when that happens</q>", but he thinks it makes
more sense to restrict the size of untorn writes.
</p>

<p>
One additional concern that Ts'o has is with writeback when a 
page is locked because, for example, a page fault is in progress. Currently, the writeback thread simply skips any locked
pages, which could result in a torn write.  He thinks the XFS
implementation for atomic writes takes care of that problem, though he has
not looked closely, but a more
general solution is probably required.
</p>

<p>
David Howells asked about the interaction between atomic writes and
<tt>mmap()</tt>.  The alignment and length of the mapped part of the file
need to be the same as that required by the atomic writes, Ts'o said, which
is presumably what was done for XFS.  Another problem comes when buffered
and direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span> are both being done to the same file, Howells said.  Ts'o
said that the filesystem community has always recommended against combining
buffered and direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>, but, since it is known that MySQL and its backup
program already do so, the community "<q>made it safe in some
circumstances</q>"; it all just works 99.9% of the time, he said.
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain said that because the <tt>RWF_ATOMIC</tt> flag is marking the
<span class="nobreak">I/O</span>, filesystems can prevent problematic combinations.  Amir Goldstein
suggested that files be opened for either atomic direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span> or atomic
buffered <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>, which is similar to the restriction added for <a
href="/Articles/932060/">FUSE passthrough mode</a>; there is a flag on the
inode of the file while it is open that indicates its mode.  Jeff Layton
pointed out that <tt>RWF_ATOMIC</tt> is a flag on the <span class="nobreak">I/O</span> operation, not
the open, but it could be used to simply return <tt>EINVAL</tt> for
operations that would violate the combination rules.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o thought it made sense to switch to an open flag, and suggested that
<tt>O_UNTORN</tt> would be the right name; the granularity for the untorn
writes could be placed in the inode.  One of the problems he sees is that
the developers have been using the term "atomic" because that is term used
by SCSI and NVMe, but then people wanted to make 1MB atomic writes work,
which is not at all what the database developers care about.  Switching to
untorn and being clear about the granularity supported will help simplify
the API and lead to the feature landing much sooner, he thinks.
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain asked Jens Axboe about the <a
href="/Articles/998783/"><tt>RWF_UNCACHED</tt> flag for uncached, buffered
<span class="nobreak">I/O</span></a> and whether it would be suitable to use for untorn writes.  Axboe
did not really have an opinion, as it is largely a filesystem, rather than a
block layer, concern, but could see that some of the effects of the flag
might be useful—immediately kicking off writeback, for example.  Ts'o
cautioned that the PostgreSQL developers actually want the page cache to
manage the caching for the database, as he understands it. One of the
reasons that they have not switched to using direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span> is that they
would need to do their own user-space cache management; he suggested
talking with the PostgreSQL developers to assess their needs.
</p>

<p>
Chris Mason said that the need for cached, untorn writes does not mean that
uncached, untorn writes should not be supported as well.  Chamberlain and
others agreed with that.  Christian Brauner noted that adding an open flag
and marking the inode would mean that other users of the file might be
precluded; that implies that privileges of some sort should be required.
The "deadly combination" is a file that is open for untorn and then gets
opened for direct <span class="nobreak">I/O</span>, Ts'o said; that is a rare enough combination that
the second open could just fail. 
</p>

<p>
The session had run out of time at that point, but Chamberlain said that it
would seem that developers are interested in supporting untorn buffered
writes, but only with some restrictive rules that had not been determined
yet.   Goldstein suggested starting
slowly with some kind of opt-in, perhaps via a mount option or
filesystem-creation flag, then possibly growing the feature from there.

Hi,<br>
<p>
Are fpw=off numbers for Postgres numbers actually somehow using RWF_ATOMIC? Because if not, the performance comparisons seem fairly meaningless - all it'd be measuring is whether increased WAL volume has a performance impact - it obviously has.<br>
<p>
RWF_ATOMIC does come with some overhead, AFAIU (on lots of devices FUA writes are slower).<br>
<p>
<p>
FWIW, we (PG) finally merged AIO support recently. Albeit, for the next release, only with read support. Just ran out of time to solve some of the corner cases for asynchronous writes. I'm fairly certain that we can get write support done for the next version. While we added readahead for a lot of places in 17 and now in 18, there are still some important ones that matter, that's the big other missing piece.<br>
<p>
You can already enable unbuffered IO, albeit for now with a flag intentionally intended to scare folks away (debug_io_direct=data).<br>
<p>
However, I'm fairly certain that even once we fully support direct IO, a large number of folks will not be able to use it. To be sane to use DIO requires a much larger buffer pool than using buffered IO would.  That's not viable for the large number of cases where postgres runs on shared hardware with either other software or other postgres instances. Which is unfortunately common.<br>
<p>
<p>
With the WIP AIO write support we have seen rather significant performance wins with writing multiple buffers at once when possible (i.e. write combining up to 32 neighboring 8kB buffers with one vectored write). My understanding is that that won't realistically be compatible with the current RWF_ATOMIC semantics. We probably can determine whether to write combine based on whether we need torn-page protection, but it'll be a painful tradeoff.<br>

We have no semantics today defined for buffered IO for RWF_ATOMIC, and so it can't be evaluated directly. At this stage the goal was to garner kernel community appreciation over it's potential, and discuss possible kernel level filesystem and block semantics. Since there seems to now be better appreciation over it's potential on the kernel, and the possible kernel semantics have been discussed the next goal would be to tailor a use case for databases that could leverage it such as PostgreSQL, and for that it's best to collaborate with the db community.<br>
<p>
Its also correct that the RWF_ATOMIC atomic semantics today require single writes, that's not because of the requirements of direct IO but rather because at least from an NVMe perspective, a write IO size must not cross a boundary size, and if that's 16k an atomic write cannot be larger than 16k, ie it's a hardware requirement. And so software must also adhere to tailor atomic writes hardware needs, and the goal of RWF_ATOMIC is to help facilitate the requirements. Although NVMe MAM in theory could help large IO RWF_ATOMIC, and wrinkle to that it only works if a large write succeeds. If a large NVMe atomic MAM write fails filesystems today on Linux have no way of telling what block was valid and which is incorrect, the atomic block which failed is not communicated back. And so the entire range would need to be invalidated, which defeats the purpose. Reflininks *may* help here to support that limitation, but that'd require some evaluation and development.<br>

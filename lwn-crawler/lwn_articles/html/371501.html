           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 27, 2010</br>
           </div>
Much of the POSIX system call interface is known for the elegance and
simplicity of its design; that is what has enabled this API to endure and
thrive for decades.  The <tt>ptrace()</tt> system call has no such
reputation.  One of the many motivations behind the development of the
utrace layer (see <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/371210/">the
accompanying article</a>) was first to clean up the implementation of
<tt>ptrace()</tt>, but then
to enable it to be replaced entirely.  Subsequent discussion shows that
this is a distant hope, though, and that we will be struck with
<tt>ptrace()</tt> for a long time.
<p>

The purpose of <tt>ptrace()</tt> is to allow one process to monitor and
modify the state of another.  It exists to support interactive debuggers
and related utilities like <tt>strace</tt>, but other users exist as well.
User-mode Linux uses <tt>ptrace()</tt> for its internal management, and
there are various sandboxing schemes which use it.  In general,
users are able to get <tt>ptrace()</tt> to do what they want, but they
rarely come away pleased with the experience.
<p>

What are the problems with <tt>ptrace()</tt>?  Whenever system calls have
to work with extended state within the kernel, the preferred mechanism for
referring to that state in user space is the file descriptor.  With file
descriptors, many of the existing system calls do natural things, and
well-defined mechanisms exist for event multiplexing.  But
<tt>ptrace()</tt> doesn't use file descriptors; it depends, instead, on a
rather more arcane mechanism.  A process to be traced is removed from its
normal place in the process tree; the process doing the tracing becomes its
new parent.  In other words, <tt>ptrace()</tt> sets up a sort of temporary
foster home for children under scrutiny.  The new parent can then learn
about events in the child through the <tt>wait()</tt> system call.
<p>
This API is hard to fit into normal application event loops.  It also
implies that any given process can be traced by only one other process at
any given time.  This may not seem like a problem - how often does one want
to run two debuggers on a process? - but it does get in the way.
Developers working on debugging tools and users wanting to trace a
sandboxed process are two types of users who cannot do what they want with
<tt>ptrace()</tt>.  It is also defined as a complex, multiplexer call (see
<a
href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">the
man page</a> for details) which is hard to understand and hard to use
efficiently.
<p>
Finally, <tt>ptrace()</tt> is hard to implement correctly and consistently.
As a result, there has been a long history of obnoxious bugs associated
with it, and user-space code which uses <tt>ptrace()</tt> tends to become
encrusted with  non-portable workarounds.  It is, in
summary, not surprising that there is interest in creating a replacement.
Oleg Nesterov <a href="/Articles/371505/">expressed things</a> succinctly:
"<q>I must admit that personally I think the current ptrace api is
unfixable, we need the new one in the long term.</q>"

<p>

Getting to the new one could be hard, though.  The first problem is that
<tt>ptrace()</tt> is a standard function which is part of the kernel ABI.
As long as users exist, it really cannot be removed from the kernel.  So a
<tt>ptrace()</tt> replacement will not improve life for the kernel
development community anytime in the near future; indeed, it will make it
harder, since there will be two tracing interfaces to support instead of
one.  Duplicating functionality in this way can be done when the need is
strong enough, but it's not something that the community will rush into
without a great deal of thought.
<p>
Maintaining <tt>ptrace()</tt> as a compatibility interface might be
acceptable if it were clearly a temporary thing with a clear possibility of
removal in the future, and if there were clear advantages of doing so.  But
it's not entirely clear where the advantages are.  For example, Kyle
Moffett <a href="/Articles/371507/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The killer app for this will be the ability to delete thousands of
	lines of code from GDB, strace, and all the various other tools
	that have to painfully work around the major interface gotchas of
	ptrace(), while at the same time making their handling of complex
	processes much more robust.
</div>
<p>
There are a couple of related problems with this idea, starting with the
fact that tools like GDB don't just run on Linux systems with shiny new
kernels.  They need to work on older kernels indefinitely, not to mention on
all those other platforms which lack the good taste to implement every new
system call created for Linux.  So those "thousands of lines" (and it
really is that much code) will not be going anywhere; the GDB developers
will have to maintain them forever - or something fairly close to that.
<p>
So for GDB, too, a new tracing API would represent an increase in the
maintenance load - if they use it.  But the fact of the matter is that
special, Linux-only interfaces tend to have very limited uptake.  As <a
href="/Articles/371509/">expressed</a> by Ingo Molnar:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Special Linux system calls have a checkered past, they tend to
	not be used by much anything, and thus they tend to be a breeding
	ground of both bugs, maintenance complexity and security
	problems. Lack of attention is never good.
</div>
<p>
That said, Tom Tromey has <a href="/Articles/371510/">indicated</a> that
GDB might use a new API if there were clear advantages to doing so:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Nevertheless, if the Linux kernel were to present a new user-space
	API, and if it had an advantage over ptrace, then we would port GDB
	to use it.  There are other platforms where, IIRC, we now use some
	/proc thing instead of ptrace.
</div>
<p>
Tom goes on to list a few features that he would like to see in a
replacement for <tt>ptrace()</tt>.  That highlights one final obstacle to
any kind of new API: no such thing has been implemented or even specified
by anybody.  The creation of a new system call - especially for a task as
complicated as tracing - is not an easy thing to do.  Without a great deal
of care, we risk creating yet another substandard API with its own warts
which must be maintained forever.  So a proposed
replacement would have to get through an extended process of criticism,
argument, and opposition, and it would have to demonstrate some real users
- a GDB port, for example.  That, alone, ensures that any <tt>ptrace()</tt>
replacement will be years away.
<p>
So it's not surprising that justifying utrace as a means to replace
<tt>ptrace()</tt> is not working very well, and it's not surprising that
developers are talking about possible ways of extending <tt>ptrace()</tt>
instead.  Playing with the <tt>ptrace()</tt> API is not without its risks -
code which uses it tends to be a bit of a house of cards which can be
broken by subtle changes in semantics.  But it may still be an easier route
to moderately more sane and usable tracing in the relatively near future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

One of the things that puzzles me a lot in the creation of new Linux system calls is the null synchronization or even simple involvement with any of the other free Unix alternatives, at least the most common one: FreeBSD.<br>
<p>
Has anyone tried approaching the other sides? Yes, the BSDs can create compatible system calls anytime they wish, but is there not any value in involving them in those activities, which basically extends the classical Unix and POSIX interfaces?<br>
<p>
With the fear of sounding a bit trollish, people used to attack Microsoft cause they forced their own way of doing things to the rest of the PC industry when they were in their most powerful position. Is Linux heading to a similar state of "implement it my way or the highway"?<br>

Ptrace() is slow. New API would hopefully be also more efficient than the <br>

           <p>April 18, 2012</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Mathieu Desnoyers, Julien Desfossez, and David Goulet</p>
           </div>
<p>
In <a href="/Articles/491510/">part 1</a> of this article, we presented
the motivations that 
led to the creation of LTTng 2.0, its features, along with an overview
of the respective strengths of LTTng 2.0, Perf, and Ftrace. We then
presented two LTTng 2.0 usage examples.

<p>
In this article, we will start with two more advanced
usage examples, and then proceed to a presentation of LTTngTop, a
low-overhead, <tt>top</tt>-alike view, based on tracing rather than
sampling <tt>/proc</tt>.  This
article focuses on some of the "cool features" that are made possible
with the LTTng 2.0 design: combined tracing of both kernel and
user space, use of performance counters to augment trace data, and
combining all these together to generate a higher-level view of the system
CPU and I/O activity with LTTngTop.  But first, we continue with the examples:

<h4>3. Combined user space and kernel tracing</h4>

<p>
This example shows how to gather a trace from both the kernel and
a user-space application. Even though the previous examples focused only
on kernel tracing, LTTng 2.0 also offers fast user-space tracing
support with the "lttng-ust" (LTTng User-space Tracer) library.
For more information on how to instrument your application, see
the <a href="http://lttng.org/doc/man-pages/man3/lttng-ust.3.html">lttng-ust(3)</a>
and
<a
href="http://lttng.org/doc/man-pages/man1/lttng-gen-tp.1.html">lttng-gen-tp(1)</a>
man pages.

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/492923/"><tt>hello.c</tt></a> test program is
distributed with the <a href="http://lttng.org/download">lttng-ust
source</a>.  It has an example tracepoint that associates various types of
data with the tracepoint.  The tracepoint data, including all of the different
types can be seen below in the first instance of hitting the tracepoint.

<pre>
    # (as root, or tracing group)
    $ lttng create
    $ lttng enable-event --kernel --all
    $ lttng enable-event --userspace --all
    $ lttng start
    $ cd lttng-ust/tests/hello
    $ ./hello		# Very, very high-throughput test application
    $ sleep 10          # [ let system generate some activity ]
    $ lttng stop
    $ lttng view
    $ lttng destroy
</pre>

<p>
Output from <tt>lttng&nbsp;view</tt>:
<pre>
    [...]

        seqfield1 = [ [0] = 116, [1] = 101, [2] = 115, [3] = 116 ], \
	_seqfield2_length = 4, seqfield2 = "test", stringfield = "test", \
	floatfield = 2222, doublefield = 2 }

        nfds = 6, timeout_msecs = -1 }

    [...]
</pre>

<p>
In short, the output above shows that CPU 1 is executing the end of a
softirq handler, CPU 3 is in user mode within the "hello" test
application, writing its high-throughput event to the buffer. This
example is taken at the moment the buffer switch occurs within the
LTTng-UST tracer, so the application signals the consumer daemon waiting
on <tt>poll()</tt> on CPU 1 that data is ready. The "hello" test
application then 
continues writing into its tracing buffer.

<p>
Correlated analysis of events coming from both the kernel and
user space, gathered efficiently without round-trips between the kernel and
user space, enables debugging systemic problems across execution layers.
User-space instrumentation with the LTTng-UST tracepoint event API, and the
use
of trace log-levels in combination with wildcards, are not covered here
for brevity, but you can look at the <a href="http://lttng.org/doc/man-pages/man1/lttng.1.html">lttng(1) man page</a> if you
are curious.


<h4>4. Performance counters and kretprobes</h4>

<p>
This example shows how to combine kernel instrumentation
mechanisms to get information that is otherwise unavailable. In this case, we
are interested in the number of LLC (Last Level Cache) misses produced
by each invocation of a function in the Linux kernel. We arbitrarily
chose the function <tt>call_rcu_sched()</tt>.

<p>
First, it is important to measure the overhead produced by kretprobes,
reading the performance monitoring unit (PMU), and tracing with LTTng to understand how much of the
total count can be attributed to the tracing itself. LTTng has a "calibrate"
command to trigger calibration functions which, when instrumented,
collect the base cost of the instrumentation.

<p>
Here is an example showing the calibration, using an i7 processor
with 4 general-purpose PMU registers.
The information about PMU registers can be found in the kernel boot
messages under "Performance Events", then look for "generic
registers". Note that some registers may be reserved by the kernel NMI
watchdog.

<p>
This sequence of commands will gather a trace executing a kretprobe
hooked on an empty function that gathers the LLC-misses information (see
<tt>lttng&nbsp;add-context&nbsp;--help</tt> to get a list
of the available PMU counters).

<pre>
    $ lttng create calibrate-function
    $ lttng enable-event calibrate --kernel --function lttng_calibrate_kretprobe
    $ lttng add-context --kernel -t perf:LLC-load-misses -t perf:LLC-store-misses \
		    -t perf:LLC-prefetch-misses
    $ lttng start
    $ for a in $(seq 1 10); do \
	    lttng calibrate --kernel --function;
    $ done
    $ lttng stop
    $ lttng view
    $ lttng destroy
</pre>

<p>
The output from babeltrace can be analyzed to look at the per-PMU counter
delta between consecutive 
"calibrate_entry" and "calibrate_return" events. Note that these
counters are per-CPU, so scheduling events need to be present in the trace to
account for migration between CPUs. Therefore, for calibration purposes,
only events staying on the same CPU should be considered.

<p>
The average result, for the i7, on 10 samples:

<pre>
				 Average     Std.Dev.
    perf_LLC_load_misses:           5.0       0.577
    perf_LLC_store_misses:          1.6       0.516
    perf_LLC_prefetch_misses:       9.0      14.742
</pre>

<p>
As can be seen, the load and store misses are relatively stable across
runs (their standard deviation is relatively low) compared to the
prefetch misses. We can conclude from this information that LLC load and
store misses can be accounted for quite precisely by removing the
calibration base-line, but pre-fetches within a function seem to behave
too erratically (not much causality link between the code executed and
the CPU pre-fetch activity) to be accounted for.

<p>
We can then continue with our test, which was performed on a 2.6.38 Linux
kernel, on a dual-core i7 SMP 
CPU, with hyperthreading (the same system that was calibrated above):

<pre>
    $ lttng create measure-call-rcu-sched
    $ lttng enable-event call_rcu_sched -k --function call_rcu_sched
    $ lttng add-context --kernel -t perf:LLC-load-misses -t perf:LLC-store-misses \
		    -t perf:LLC-prefetch-misses
    $ lttng start
    $ sleep 10        # [ let system generate some activity ]
    $ lttng stop
    $ lttng view
    $ lttng destroy
</pre>

<p>
Here is some sample output using:

<pre>
    $ lttng view -e 'babeltrace --clock-raw --no-delta'

    timestamp = 37648.652070250,
    name = call_rcu_sched_entry,
    stream.packet.context = { cpu_id = 1 },
    stream.event.context = {
	    perf_LLC_prefetch_misses = 3814,
	    perf_LLC_store_misses = 9866,
	    perf_LLC_load_misses = 16328
    },
    event.fields = {
	    ip = 0xFFFFFFFF81094A5E,
	    parent_ip = 0xFFFFFFFF810654D3
    }

    timestamp = 37648.652073373,
    name = call_rcu_sched_return,
    stream.packet.context = { cpu_id = 1 },
    stream.event.context = {
	    perf_LLC_prefetch_misses = 3815,
	    perf_LLC_store_misses = 9871,
	    perf_LLC_load_misses = 16337
    },
    event.fields = {
	    ip = 0xFFFFFFFF81094A5E,
	    parent_ip = 0xFFFFFFFF810654D3
    }
</pre>

<p>
An analysis of the 1159 entry/return pairs on CPU 1 that did not migrate
between processors yields:

<pre>				 Average     Std.Dev.
    perf_LLC_load_misses:          4.727      6.371
    perf_LLC_store_misses:         1.280      1.198
    perf_LLC_prefetch_misses:      1.662      4.832
</pre>

<p>
So the numbers we have here are within the range of the empty function
calibration. We can therefore say that <tt>call_rcu_sched()</tt> is doing a good
job at staying within the Last Level Cache. We could repeat the
experiment with other kernel functions, targeting L1 misses, branch
misses, and various other PMU counters.


<h4>LTTngTop</h4>

<a href="/Articles/492958/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2012/lttngtop-io-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5 align="right"
width=190 height=200 alt="[LTTngTop]">
</a>

<p>
LTTngTop is a ncurses-based tool developed to provide system administrators
with a 
convenient way to browse traces and quickly find a problem, or at least a
period of time when a problem occurred. That information considerably
reduces the number of events we need to analyze manually. It is designed to suit
the system administrators because it behaves like the popular <tt>top</tt> CPU
activity monitoring program. In addition to the usual behavior of
<tt>top</tt> and 
similar tools, where the display is refreshed at a fixed interval, LTTngTop
allows the user to pause the reading of the trace to take time to look at what
is happening, and also to go back and forth in time to easily see the evolution
between two states.

<p>
In order to properly handle the events without the risk of
attributing statistics to the wrong process in case of a lost event, we
require that the events be self-describing. For use with LTTngTop, it
is required that each event include the process identifier (PID), the process
name (procname), the thread identifier (tid), and parent process identifier
(ppid), all of which can be done using the context information. Although
adding this data makes the trace bigger, it ensures 
that every event is handled appropriately, even if LTTng needs to
discard some events (which can happen if the trace sub-buffers are too
small).

<p>
As of now, LTTngTop only works with recorded traces, but work is in
progress 
to support live tracing. The tool displays
statistics such as the CPU usage time, the PMU counters (real data per-process,
not sampled), and the I/O bandwidth. By default it reads one second of
trace data and refreshes the display every second which gives the feeling
of playing back the activity on the system. The intended usage of this tool is
to allow non-developers (especially system administrators) to use trace data
and to help pinpoint the period of time when a problem occurred on the
system.

<p>
In the following example, we record a trace suitable for analysis with LTTngTop
(with pid, procname, tid, ppid context information associated with each event)
and with three PMU counters.

<pre>
    $ lttng create
    $ lttng enable-event --kernel --all
    $ lttng add-context -k -t pid -t procname -t tid -t ppid \
	    -t perf:cache-misses -t perf:major-faults \
	    -t perf:branch-load-misses
    $ lttng start
    $ sleep 10	# [ let system generate some activity ]
    $ lttng stop
    $ lttng destroy
    $ lttngtop /path/to/the/trace
</pre>

<p>
With this example, you will see exactly the activity that occurred on the
system, and can use the left and right arrows on the keyboard to navigate
forward and backward in the
history.
As noted above, work is in progress to support live trace reads. It will
be performed through a shared memory map on the local machine, and
eventually should support viewing live traces streamed from a remote
target.
LTTngTop is still in development mode but is usable, it can be found in the
<a href="http://git.lttng.org">Git tree</a>, and the README explains how to
get it up and running. 


<h4>Upstreaming: The road ahead</h4>

<p>
We really hope that the LTTng features will gradually make their way
into the upstream kernel. Our target with LTTng 2.0 has been to ensure
that our user base quickly gets access to the features provided by LTTng
2.0 through their Linux distributions, without having to wait for the
upstreaming process to come to completion.

<p>
It remains to be discussed whether the LTTng-specific focus on integrated,
low-overhead, full-system tracing, and its ability to share tools with
various industry players, make strong enough arguments to justify
merging its ABI into the Linux kernel. Nevertheless, our goal is to
share the common pieces of infrastructure with Perf and Ftrace whenever
it is beneficial for all of the projects to do so.


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
The very low overhead and high-scalability of the LTTng tracer makes it
an excellent choice to tackle issues on  high-availability,
low-latency, production servers dealing with high-throughput data. The
tracer flexibility allows combining traces gathered from both kernel and
user space to be analyzed on a common time-line.

<p>
LTTng has been used to debug performance, behavior, and real-time issues
at various client sites.
Some examples include using the kernel tracer to identify an abnormally
long interrupt handler duration and to pinpoint the cause of delays in a
soft real-time system due to a firmware bug.
At the I/O level, identification of bottlenecks
caused by combined fsync() calls and large logs being written by
timing-sensitive services was made possible by use of tracing. Another
client example was one that experienced slowdowns and timeouts
after moving from a local to a distributed filesystem: identifying 
much longer I/O requests in the distributed setup using the LTTng kernel
tracer allowed us to pinpoint a filesystem cache that was too small as the root
cause of the problem.

<p>
We are currently working on several features for LTTng 2.1:
integration of flight recorder "snapshots" into lttng-tools, live trace
streaming over the network, system-wide LTTng-UST buffers, and filtering
of LTTng-UST event fields at trace collection time. With these features and
others down the road on top of the existing LTTng 2.0 base, we hope to succeed
in our goal to make developers' and system administrators' lives easier.

Looks like an awesome set of tools. It's unfortunate that it needs external modules to work. We have production machines where this would be awesome, and they get kernel updates reasonably regularly, but custom modules is just that little bit more work. That said, I'll certainly be trying them out at home.<br>

With my Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU L7500  @ 1.60GHz, 3.4.0 mainline, Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit and all the LTTNG components built from git I get the following:<br>

You probably cannot activate that many performance counters concurrently on your processor. See the dmesg output. Here is an excerpt of mine for example:<br>
<p>
Performance Events: PEBS fmt1+, generic architected perfmon, Intel PMU driver.<br>
... version:                3<br>
... bit width:              48<br>
... generic registers:      4        &lt;------------------<br>
... value mask:             0000ffffffffffff<br>
... max period:             000000007fffffff<br>
... fixed-purpose events:   3<br>
... event mask:             000000070000000f<br>
<p>
In this case, my processor supports 4 concurrent performance counters. (for reference, cpuinfo: model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3520M CPU @ 2.90GHz). So try removing one of the perf counters and it should be fine.<br>

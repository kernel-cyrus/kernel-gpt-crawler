<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 15, 2008</br>
           </div>
There are a number of filesystem-related patches aimed at the upcoming
2.6.25 merge window; one of those is the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/264188/">unprivileged mount patch</a> by
Miklos Szeredi.  This patch enables an unprivileged user process to call
the <tt>mount()</tt> system call and - in certain circumstances - have that
call actually succeed.  It could eventually lead to a situation where users
have more flexibility to create their own environments and the setuid
<tt>mount</tt> utility is no longer needed.
<p>

This patch adds a new field (<tt>uid</tt>) to the <tt>vfsmount</tt>
structure, allowing the kernel to keep track of the owner of a specific
filesystem mount.  The system administrator can give ownership of a
specific mount to a user with the new <tt>MNT_SETUSER</tt> flag.  A common
pattern might be to bind-mount a user's home directory on top of itself,
giving the user the ownership of that mount.  Once that
has been done, the user is allowed to freely mount other filesystems below
that mount point - with a couple of conditions:
<p>
<ul>
<li> There is a system-wide limit on the number of allowed user mounts;
     once that limit is hit, no more unprivileged mounts will be allowed
     until somebody unmounts something.  The current patch has no provision
     for per-user or per-group mount limits, but such a feature would not
     be particularly hard to add should the need arise.
<p>
<li> The filesystem type must be marked as being safe for unprivileged
     mounts.  Miklos notes that a filesystem must go through "a thorough
     audit" before this flag can be set with any confidence.  The patch, as
     posted, marks the fuse filesystem (which allows for the creation of
     filesystems implemented in user space) as being safe; fuse was
     designed for this mode of operation in the first place.  Bind mounts
     are also allowed, with some additional conditions.
</ul>
<p>
If the system allows the mount, the flags allowing for setuid and device
files will be forcibly cleared - unless the user has the requisite
capabilities anyway.  Users are allowed to unmount filesystems they own,
again without privilege, but cannot unmount any others.  Another new mount
flag (<tt>MNT_NOMNT</tt>) marks a specific filesystem as being the end of
the line - no unprivileged submounts are allowed below it.

all this should be a mechanism by which users can organize their filesystem
hierarchies without any need for administrative privileges, and without the
risk of compromising system security.
<p>

One might well wonder why this change to the <tt>mount()</tt> system call
is called for, given that users have been able to do unprivileged mounts
for years.  The answer is that the current mechanism has a couple of
shortcomings.  Every potential unprivileged mount must be explicitly
enabled via a line in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.  That works well for simple
situations, such as allowing a user to mount a CD or a USB storage device.
When users start wanting to do more complicated things, like mounting their
own special fuse filesystems, the <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> mechanism breaks
down.  There is a separate, setuid program which grants the right to make
unprivileged fuse mounts, but it represents a workaround rather than a
proper solution.
<p>

The current user mount mechanism also requires that the <tt>mount</tt>
utility be installed setuid root.  Every setuid binary is a potential
security hole, so there is value in eliminating privileged programs when
possible.  The unprivileged mount patch offers the possibility of
eliminating the setuid mount program while simultaneously leaving policy
control in the hands of the system administrator.  So, unless something
surprising comes up, chances are good that this capability will appear in
the 2.6.25 kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Maybe the "thorough audit" part already covers this, but another big concern is "what does it
look like to other users?"  For example, in fuse, you could make a filesystem that delayed
arbitrarily long when you tried to read a file, or made it seem like you had an infinitely
deep directory structure.  If some other user's process (like an "updatedb" run by root) could
get trapped in here, it's now a DoS and potential security issue.  Fuse gets around this by
simply disallowing it unless you specify "allow_other" when mounting.

The place where I always seem to need this is for loop devices, particularly for mounting a
ISO images.  I could understand if noexec, nosuid, etc. were automatically disallowed, but all
I want is to see the contents.  Anyone have a good solution (that doesn't involve sudo)?

With this patch, I'm assuming iso9660 rules would apply, or would/could there be special
handling of the loop option?

If you have fuse installed, then there's fuseiso (most distros have it packaged) or mountlo
(<a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/27/148">http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/27/148</a>), which can mount arbitrary file system types.

Kernel based loop mounting would be useful, but first each filesystem's code must be audited,
to make sure they handle any filesystem image, even one specially crafted with malicious
intent.  This is a big job, it is much simpler to use some completely userspace solution, like
mountlo.

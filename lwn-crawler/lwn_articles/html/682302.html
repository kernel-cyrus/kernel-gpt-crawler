<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 6, 2016</br>
           </div>
The merging of <a href="/Articles/635771/">security-module stacking</a> was
supposed to jump-start the creation of a whole set of small, special-purpose
security modules.  By making it possible for security modules to play well
together, stacking enables modules that solve one little
problem rather than implementing an entire security policy.  Thus far, the
flood of new modules has yet to begin, but the <a
href="/Articles/681613/">LoadPin module</a> from Kees Cook demonstrates the
sort of problem that little security modules might be written to solve.
<p>
Security-conscious developers have long worried about code that is loaded
into the kernel at run time; such code could clearly, if malicious, subvert
the security of the entire system.  Mechanisms like <a
href="/Articles/525592/">the signing of kernel 
modules</a> are designed to prevent the loading of such code.  In the end,
though, a signature on a loadable module really only guarantees one thing:
where that module came from.  If the provenance of kernel modules (or other
files loaded into the kernel) could be
ascertained by other means, it would not be necessary to sign them.
<p>
ChromeOS keeps its security-sensitive files, including kernel modules,
in read-only storage; that storage is verified as a whole before the system
boots.  In such a setting, the loading of modules from the read-only
partition is safe regardless of whether they have been signed; they are
known to come from Google and cannot have been 
modified since.  So a reasonable security policy for ChromeOS systems might
well be to load modules (without signature checking) from the secure
partition, while rejecting the loading of modules from anywhere else.
<p>
That is the policy that LoadPin was created to implement.  It takes
advantage of the relatively new <a href="/Articles/676101/">kernel
file-loading mechanism</a> to intercept all attempts to load a file into
the kernel; these include loading kernel modules, reading firmware, loading
a security policy, or
loading an image for <tt>kexec()</tt>.  In each case, the filesystem
containing the file to be loaded is compared against the filesystem used in
the first load operation after boot; if the two don't match, the attempt is
rejected.  All that is required is to build the security module into the
kernel; there is no other configuration needed or possible.
<p>
The resulting mechanism is, obviously, quite simple in nature.
Administrators who want to enable file loading from multiple filesystems,
or who want to change the allowed filesystem during the lifetime of the
system will be out of luck.  But, for the simple case where the system
boots from a trusted, read-only image, LoadPin does all that is needed.
<p>
In truth, the interface isn't quite that simple.  If (and only if) the
first load operation is satisfied by a writable filesystem, the LoadPin
module will log a warning and establish a sysctl knob
(<tt>kernel/load_pinning</tt>) that can be used to turn the feature on or
off.  This, of course, is a debugging mechanism; normally one would not
want to be able to write to the filesystem containing the trusted modules.
After all, the immutability of the trusted filesystem is the foundation on
which the trust in its contents is being built.  On a production system,
the ability to disable pinning would also be undesirable.
<p>
It would not be surprising if other developers eventually showed up wanting
to add more complex configuration options to this module.  One could
imagine wanting to apply different policies to different types of files
(firmware or <tt>kexec()</tt> images),
for example.  The current module is also likely to run into trouble on
systems that boot with an initramfs image; the first modules will almost
certainly be loaded from that image (that's why it exists, usually),
causing loads to be pinned to a temporary filesystem that will go away at
the end of the bootstrap process.  In the current patch, if the filesystem
to which loading is pinned disappears, loading of files will be disabled
entirely â€” behavior that makes sense, but which may not lead to the
desired results in an initramfs setting.
<p>
But that is work for later, should
somebody decide that it is needed.
For now, the simple security module would appear to be enough for Google's
needs.  Indeed, the copyright dates in the code suggest that it has been in
use there since 2011.
<p>
As Casey Schaufler suggested in <a href="/Articles/674949/">his talk</a> on
writing one's own security module, the stacking mechanism makes it possible
to implement a wide variety of possible policies.  LoadPin, perhaps, will
be the start of a series of modules from developers who have extended the
kernel's security mechanisms in novel ways.  The potential is there for
some interesting ideas to be contributed back to the kernel.  Given that
relatively few people seem to think that we have solved all of the security
problems with what we have now, that seems like it should be a step in the
right direction.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Linux has multiple methods of booting on (U)EFI platforms, each with its
merits and drawbacks, and it's not always clear when you should use each
of them or why.
What follows is a whirlwind tour of the evolution of booting Linux on
x86 EFI machines, along with a look at the implementations of the
various schemes.
<p>
This article won't cover the basics of booting Linux on BIOS, since
that's been <a
href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-linuxboot/">covered
elsewhere</a> . Instead, it will focus on the particulars
of booting on EFI and how the state of the art has changed over time to
adapt to the needs of the kernel community and its users.
<p>
<h4>Legacy EFI boot</h4>
<p>
Up until Linux 3.3, the only way to boot Linux on EFI hardware was
to use an EFI OS loader. This process begins with the EFI firmware boot
manager loading a boot loader, such as GRUB. The boot loader is then
responsible for loading the Linux kernel and any ramdisk images, taking
control of the platform from the firmware, and jumping to the kernel
entry point.

At a high level, this is all very similar to the way things work on
legacy BIOS platforms. In fact, there are very few places where the
kernel really knows it was booted from EFI and not BIOS â€” most of the
intricacies of booting on EFI platforms are hidden inside the boot
loader.
<p>
If you're trying to bring up Linux on a new firmware, keeping the
process as similar as possible to that used on existing, working systems is
highly 
desirable. It achieves maximum code reuse both in terms of boot loader
source (since most things just need to be recompiled for the firmware's
executable file format) and the difficult-to-debug early kernel boot
code. When x86 EFI systems first started hitting the consumer market,
making the fewest changes possible was the safest strategy.

Of course, there are some special steps that an EFI boot loader must
perform, and a handful of EFI-specific pieces of information that need
to be passed from the boot loader to the kernel.
<p>
For a start, EFI firmware has two very distinct phases of execution
delimited by the termination of the EFI "Boot Services."
Initially, the
EFI firmware has control over the platform. This allows the firmware to
provide a variety of services, such as
memory allocation, timers, and event services, to EFI applications and
drivers. These are known as Boot 
Services. It is the boot loader's responsibility to terminate Boot
Services by calling the firmware's <tt>ExitBootServices()</tt> function and
transition to the second phase of boot (the EFI Runtime
Services will remain available). Once <tt>ExitBootServices()</tt> has been
called, the firmware relinquishes control of the platform to the OS
loader, and ultimately, to the kernel. From that point forward the
kernel owns the platform and can install page tables, interrupt
handlers, and bring memory allocators online; all the things that usually
happen during kernel boot.
<p>
Crucially, some properties of the platform and its devices cannot be
discovered post-<tt>ExitBootServices()</tt> because Boot Services functions are
required to identify them. The boot loader therefore has the additional
responsibility of doing this discovery, stashing the data, and handing it
to the kernel inside of a <tt>struct&nbsp;boot_params</tt> object. The relevant
members of this structure for EFI boot are highlighted below,
<p>
<pre>
    struct boot_params {
	struct screen_info screen_info;
        ...
	struct efi_info {
	    __u32 efi_loader_signature;
	    __u32 efi_systab;
	    __u32 efi_memdesc_size;
	    __u32 efi_memdesc_version;
	    __u32 efi_memmap;
	    __u32 efi_memmap_size;
	    __u32 efi_systab_hi;
	    __u32 efi_memmap_hi;
	} efi_info;
	...
	__u8  e820_entries;
	...
	struct setup_header {
	    ...
	    __u64 setup_data;
	    ...
	} hdr;
	...
	struct e820entry e820_map[E820MAX];
	...
    };
</pre>
<p>
The important pieces of data in this structure are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The EFI memory map and associated data (found in
     <tt>efi_info.efi_memmap</tt> and <tt>efi_memmap_hi</tt>).
<p>     
<li> The EFI System Table pointer (stored in <tt>efi_info.efi_systab</tt>
     and <tt>efi_systab_hi</tt>).
<p>
<li> Graphics (<tt>screen_info</tt>) and PCI device information
     (<tt>hdr.setup_data</tt>). 
</ul>
<p>
Despite the fact that <tt>struct&nbsp;boot_params</tt> already contains an E820
table (<tt>e820_map</tt>) describing all memory regions, the EFI memory map is
also saved and passed to the kernel since it includes EFI-specific
region types and other region attributes. The EFI System Table contains
data used by the kernel at runtime; for example, it holds a pointer to the
Runtime 
Services dispatch table, which is used by the kernel to do things like
create, delete and update EFI variables.

The details of any graphics devices present on the platform are stored in
<tt>boot_params.screen_info</tt>; key details being the physical address
and size 
of the frame buffer. And finally, PCI device details are recorded in a
singly-linked list at <tt>boot_params.hdr.setup_data</tt>.
<p>
Once the boot loader has gathered all of this data, loaded the kernel
and optional ramdisk files, and terminated Boot Services, it prepares to
jump to the kernel entry point and resume the common boot process.
<p>
With the influx of x86 EFI implementations into the market in 2012,
there was a wide variability in their quality, which meant there were a
lot of bugs. The most publicized bug was the <a
href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2026807/booting-linux-via-uefi-can-brick-some-samsung-laptops.html">Samsung
bricking issue</a>, 
which affected some Samsung laptop models and, once encountered,
resulted in users being entirely unable to boot their machines.

Some bugs were worked around inside the kernel without too much problem,
some were handled in the boot loader. But one thing was clear â€” the
situation was not going to improve overnight.
<p>
Furthermore, because it was impossible to guess at the kind of bugs that
would be seen in the future, a more robust solution was needed â€” one that
would not require kernel and boot loader support to be developed in
lockstep. The kernel developers needed a way to make changes quickly as
new bugs were discovered.

A solution was <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=130756991102498&w=3">proposed</a>
by H. Peter Anvin, and immediately 
backed by Linus: the kernel would <i>become</i> the boot loader.
<p>
<h4>EFI boot stub (CONFIG_EFI_STUB)</h4>
<p>
Peter's idea was to carry a "boot stub" in the
kernel image that would take on the responsibility of terminating Boot
Services. In some scenarios, this obviates the need for a Linux boot
loader entirely.

The major benefit that comes with giving the kernel the responsibility
for calling <tt>ExitBootServices()</tt> is that it gains control of the platform
much earlier than is otherwise possible. That means it can apply
bug workarounds much sooner in the boot process. Furthermore,
distributing workarounds for firmware bugs to end users now only
requires a kernel upgrade, instead of a boot loader upgrade, because
the boot ABI would remain unchanged.
<p>
The EFI boot stub doesn't actually live in the kernel proper. Rather, it
is a small piece of code that is prepended to a compressed kernel image,
and is executed directly by the boot loader or the firmware Boot
Manager.

So that EFI firmware understands how to load and execute a kernel with
the EFI boot stub, a Portable Executable (PE) image header is inserted
into the kernel image at build time. To the firmware, the kernel appears
to be a legitimate EFI application, complete with entry point address,
section tables and relocation information â€” the kernel image is said to
"masquerade" as an EFI application.
<p>
As luck would have it, the only important fields in the PE header that overlap
with the <tt>bzImage</tt> header found at the start of the kernel image are the "MZ"
magic string (offset 0x0) and the 
field that points to the rest of the PE header (offset 0x3c). These
fields can be inserted into the existing <tt>bzImage</tt> header without causing
trouble because the <tt>bzImage</tt> uses those addresses to store code that is
only ever executed by unsupported legacy boot loaders to print an error
message. 

The rest of the PE header, pointed at by offset 0x3c, is located at an
arbitrary position within the first 512 bytes of the image and contains
information such as the EFI boot stub entry point, the architecture the
kernel was compiled for, number of sections, size of the image, and
other miscellaneous items used in describing a PE application.
<p>
The entry point for the EFI boot stub conforms to the ABI defined in the
EFI specification:
<p>
<pre>
    EFI_STATUS efi_main(EFI_HANDLE handle, EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *table);
</pre>
<p>
Once the firmware loads the kernel image and jumps to the EFI boot stub
entry point, the boot stub begins performing all the necessary jobs for
the OS to take control of the platform, just like the boot loader in the
legacy EFI boot.
<p>
First, this involves building a <tt>struct boot_params</tt> object, loading any
ramdisks specified on the command line, discovering the platform
topology and stashing the information for later processing by the
kernel. Secondly, <tt>ExitBootServices()</tt> is called and the kernel takes
control of the platform. Because all these steps are performed inside
the boot stub, it entirely replaces the need for a Linux boot loader.
<p>
Despite the fact that boot loader functionality needs to be
re-implemented in the boot stub, the size of the code is actually fairly
small. The boot stub uses the Boot Services provided by the firmware for
things like memory allocation, filesystem access and printing to the
console; the boot stub does not include any drivers of its own.
<p>
This lack of drivers highlights one of the drawbacks of booting using
the EFI boot stub. Remember, the boot stub isn't part of the kernel
proper, so no matter which drivers you build into your kernel, the boot
stub can't use them to load files from Linux filesystems. For most
platforms, this ultimately means it is not possible to boot Linux
directly from Linux filesystems. Instead, the kernel image and any
ramdisk images need to reside on media that the firmware contains
built-in drivers for. Essentially, this means the EFI System Partition
(ESP) or some other FAT filesystem.
<p>
Additionally, because the PE header contains an architecture field, it's
not possible to boot a 64-bit kernel image on 32-bit firmware using the
EFI boot stub, since the firmware PE image loader will complain that the
file has an incompatible architecture.

While these restrictions are acceptable in many situations, some users
want to take advantage of the EFI boot stub, but not at the expense of
sacrificing a polished boot experience.
<p>
<h4>EFI handover protocol</h4>
<p>
The EFI handover protocol first appeared in Linux 3.6.  It provides a
middle ground by combining the best of the legacy and EFI boot stub
schemes: being able to boot from Linux filesystems while applying
workarounds in the boot stub.

This protocol defines a new entry point into the kernel
image â€” one that points after the code to allocate a <tt>boot_params</tt>
structure 
in the EFI boot stub. The EFI handover protocol cannot be used by EFI
firmware because the entry point does not use the EFI application ABI,
so a Linux boot loader is required.
<p>
Internally, jumping to the EFI handover protocol entry point still
handles early device discovery, saving of the EFI memory map data, and
termination of the Boot Services.

Since entering the handover entry point skips the <tt>struct boot_params</tt>
initialization and loading of ramdisk files, the boot loader is
responsible for allocating the object and accessing the filesystem. In
the process, a Linux boot loader can provide the features that many users
have come to expect: loading from Linux filesystems, 
graphical boot menus, configuration files, etc.
<p>
A Linux boot loader finds the entry point for the handover protocol by
looking at the <tt>handover_offset</tt> field of the
<tt>boot_params.hdr</tt> kernel header:
<p>
<pre>
    struct boot_params {
	...
	struct setup_header {
	    ...
	    __u32	handover_offset;
	} hdr;
    	...
    };
</pre>
<p>
The value of this field is an offset from the beginning of the kernel
image, and the runtime entry point address can be calculated by adding
<tt>boot_params.hdr.handover_offset</tt> to the kernel image load address. 
<p>
The entry point prototype looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    void handover(EFI HANDLE handle, EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *table,
    	 	  struct boot_params *bp);
</pre>
<p>
The handover protocol can be thought of as a subset of the EFI boot
stub, since code executed by the handover protocol is also executed by
the EFI boot stub (but not vice versa).
<p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
Each of the schemes discussed above solves a different problem. If you
need the ability to boot from Linux filesystems, using a Linux boot
loader such as GRUB with the EFI handover protocol would be the best
option since the advantage of using the latest kernel workarounds for
firmware bugs is retained. If you just need to load a kernel quickly
with no frills, look at booting with the EFI boot stub directly from the
firmware.
<p>
It's possible to pass the usual kernel parameters directly to the EFI
boot stub, but most are silently passed through to the kernel proper.
However, the <tt>initrd=</tt> option is interpreted directly by the EFI boot
stub and allows initial ramdisks to be loaded from the ESP and other
firmware-supported filesystems.
<p>
Support for building the EFI boot stub is enabled by turning on the
<tt>CONFIG_EFI_STUB</tt> option in the kernel config. <a
href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gummiboot/">Gummiboot</a> is an
EFI 
application loader that leverages kernels built with <tt>CONFIG_EFI_STUB</tt>,
and there is no Linux-specific boot code to be found anywhere in the
source. It uses the the <tt>LoadImage()</tt> and <tt>StartImage()</tt> Boot
Services 
provided by the firmware to load and run kernel images. I
also use <tt>CONFIG_EFI_STUB</tt> kernels containing an embedded ramdisk
to boot bare-metal EFI machines.
<p>
The EFI handover protocol entry point is exported when  the
<tt>CONFIG_EFI_STUB</tt> kernel option is enabled. The versions of GRUB&nbsp;2
shipping with 
major distributions (Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian) include support for
booting via the EFI handover protocol. Use of this
protocol is enabled with the "<tt>linuxefi</tt>" GRUB command (with
corresponding 
<tt>initrdefi</tt> commands for initial ramdisk files), which are used in the
same way as the legacy <tt>linux</tt> (and <tt>initrd</tt>) commands, e.g.
<p>
<pre>
    linuxefi  /boot/efi/EFI/vmlinuz.efi
    initrdefi /boot/efi/EFI/initramfs.img
</pre>    
<p>
The handover protocol is also used by <a
href="http://www.tianocore.org/ovmf/">Tianocore's OVMF firmware</a> for 
QEMU when using the 
<tt>-kernel</tt> command line parameter to directly boot a kernel, e.g.
<p>
<pre>
    qemu-system-x86-64 -kernel /path/bzImage
</pre>
<p>
Whichever option you pick, the beauty is that a single kernel image can
be built that supports all of the schemes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
How many of these bugs affect Windows, requiring Microsoft to have similar workarounds in place?<br>
<p>
If not many, how come it takes Linux to trigger all the other EFI bugs? Surely, Linux is not the most demanding EFI user out there, pushing EFI limits!?<br>
<p>
If many affect Windows as well, how come so many EFI bugs get released at all since booting Windows must certainly be the EFI bar to pass?<br>
<p>
Wild guesses and other speculations welcome :-) Like for instance this one: Microsoft initially implemented a long but finite list of EFI workarounds, which all BIOS implementers get "for free" without even noticing while Linux is rediscovering them one by one.<br>

Bugs that happened to visible break the setup they had been testing got more or less papered over by vendor duhvelopers; those had been a minuscule subset of bogosity spewed forth by said duhvelopers and the rest remains uncaught.  Testing another setup has uncovered (again, minuscule) subset of remaining bogosity, some of those not affecting the original setup at all, some breaking it, but doing so in a subtler way.  Without a doubt a metric arseload of bugs remain undiscovered; never underestimate the amount of garbage lusers can excrete, given an editor, keyboard and supply of oxygen...<br>
<p>
Neither kernel attempts to maximize the amount of turds to step into; there is a major difference between writing a testsuite trying to visibly trigger as many bugs as possible and writing something that tries hard _not_ to.  There is a _lot_ of ways to fuck up an implementation of a standard; for something only nominally sentient (albeit human from the legal point of view, more's the pity) lusers do imitate creativity surprisingly well in that area, Murphy Law being what it is.  So there's an immense swamp of intellectual output to navigate and unless you happen to step precisely in the footprints of the other guy, you are practically certain to step into a lot of shit they didn't step into...<br>

Isn't Linux trying to step precisely in the footprints of the other guy to avoid finding new issues? I thought this was the long and firmly established tradition with BIOS.<br>

We try. There were many operating systems booting on BIOS before Linux came along, and so many of the quirks were already known. That wasn't the case with UEFI. The issues we keep hitting are cases where we implemented functionality without knowing what Windows did, and so poked different functions in different ways and exercised different bugs. The last four years have been an exercise in identifying areas where we still have disparities and dealing with them.<br>

I guess none of these bugs ever had any security impact *cough* since it would invalidate Secure Boot *cough*.<br>

Yeah, nothing we've hit has been a strong security issue - there's been a couple of denial of service cases, but nothing that allowed arbitrary code. There *have* been issues in some firmware implementations that permitted arbitrary code to be executed, and some of those could be used to circumvent Secure Boot on some platforms. Software is hard.<br>

<p>
Maybe Windows has same problems (for instance waking up from power saving modes on some hardware), but Windows users have a different definition of "working" - they expect to pay to have a fix - so they do not complain too much.<br>

It's simpler than that: many if not most EFI implementation are for computers that will delivered with MS Windows pre-installed. For that reason the developers will find their implementation working once it boots the targeted MS Windows versions.<br>
<p>
A nasty consequence of this circumstance can be that errors in the MS Window boot code, may cause those EFI developers to adjust their code in order to have MS Windows boot properly.<br>

<p>
I can give you an example of a pre-installed Windows 7 on a branded portable PC which is not working(1) when waking from hibernation.<br>
No update for the BIOS are present after 2 years.<br>
<p>
(1) not working: In the Unix/Linux sense, meaning it sometimes fails.<br>
 Windows users would call it "working" because on a good day, you can try to close the lid for few seconds so the screen re-enter power saving mode - then re-open the lid - and you may get back your screen.<br>
 Windows user have learned to carry lucky things and put them on the top left side of the screen when using their computers. Me, I am not superstitious, that brings bad luck...<br>

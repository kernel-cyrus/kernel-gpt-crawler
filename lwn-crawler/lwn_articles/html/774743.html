<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 14, 2018</br>
           </div>
Indirect function calls — calls to a function whose address is stored in a
pointer variable — have never been blindingly fast, but the Spectre
hardware vulnerabilities have made things far worse.  The indirect branch
predictor used to speed up indirect calls in the CPU can no longer be
used, and performance has suffered accordingly.  The <a
href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886">"retpoline"
mechanism</a> 
was a brilliant hack that proved faster than the hardware-based solutions
that were tried at the beginning.  While retpolines took a lot of the pain
out of Spectre mitigation, experience over the last year has made it clear
that they still hurt.  It is thus not surprising that developers have been
looking for alternatives to retpolines; several of them have shown up on
the kernel lists recently.
<p>
The way to make an indirect call faster is to replace it with a direct
call; that renders branch prediction unnecessary.  Of course, if a direct
call would have sufficed in any given situation, the developer would have
used it rather than an indirect call, so this replacement is not always
straightforward.  All of the proposed solutions to retpoline overhead
strive to do that replacement in one way or another, though; they vary from
the simple to the complex.

<p>
<h4>Speeding up DMA operations</h4>
<p>
The simplest method is often the best; that is the approach taken in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181207190720.18517-1-hch@lst.de/">Christoph
Hellwig's patch set</a> speeding up the DMA-mapping code.  Setting up DMA
buffers can involve a lot of architecture-specific trickery; the DMA
mapping layer does its best to hide that trickery behind a common API.  As
is often the case in the kernel, the code in the middle uses a structure
full of function pointers to direct a generic DMA call to the code that
can implement it in any specific setting.
<p>
It turns out, though, that the most common case for DMA mapping is the
simplest: the memory is simply directly mapped in both the CPU's and the
device's address space with no particular trickery required.  Hellwig's
work takes advantage of that fact by testing for this case and calling the
direct-mapping support code directly rather than going through a function
pointer.  So, for example, code that looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    addr = ops-&gt;map_page(...);
</pre>
<p>
is transformed into something like:
<p>
<pre>
    if (dma_is_direct(ops))
    	addr = dma_direct_map_page(...);
    else
    	addr = ops-&gt;map_page(...);
</pre>
<p>
The cost of the <tt>if</tt> test is more than recouped in the
direct-mapping case by avoiding the indirect function call (and it is tiny
relative to the cost of that call in the other cases).  Jesper Dangaard
Brouer, who 
reported the performance hit in the DMA-mapping code, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181208170648.296fb8a1@redhat.com/">expressed his
happiness</a> at this change: "<q>my XDP performance is back</q>".
Barring problems, this change seems likely to be merged sometime soon.
<p>
<a name="list"></a>
<h4>Choosing from a list</h4>
<p>
In some situations, an indirect function call will end up invoking one out
of a relatively small list of known functions; a variant of the above
approach can be used to test for each of the known alternatives and call
the correct function directly.  
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1544032300.git.pabeni@redhat.com/">This patch
set</a> from Paolo Abeni implements that approach with a simple set of
macros.  If a given variable <tt>func</tt> can point to either of
<tt>f1()</tt> or <tt>f2()</tt>, the indirect call can be
avoided with code that looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    INDIRECT_CALLABLE_DECLARE(f1(args...));
    INDIRECT_CALLABLE_DECLARE(f2(args...));
    /* ... */
    INDIRECT_CALL_2(func, f2, f1, args...);
</pre>
<p>
This code will expand to something like:
<p>
<pre>
    if (func == f1)
    	f1(args);
    else if (func == f2)
    	f2(args);
    else
    	(*func)(args);
</pre>
<p>
Abeni's patch set is aimed at the network stack, so it contains some
additional optimizations that can apply when the choice is between the IPv4
and IPv6 versions of a function.  He claims a 10% or so improvement for a
UDP generic receive offload (GRO) benchmark.  Networking maintainer David
Miller has <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181206.222409.551374562843523036.davem@davemloft.net/">indicated
a willingness</a> to accept this work, though the current patch set <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181206.222855.1688568512001921392.davem@redhat.com/">needs
a couple of repairs</a> before it can be merged.
<p>
<a name="static"></a>
<h4>Static calls</h4>
<p>
Sometimes indirect calls reflect a mode of operation in the kernel that is
not often changed; in such cases, the optimal approach might be to just
turn the indirect call into a direct call and patch the code when the
target must be changed.  That is the approach taken by the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1543200841.git.jpoimboe@redhat.com/">static
calls patch set</a> from Josh Poimboeuf.
<p>
Imagine a global variable <tt>target</tt> that can hold a pointer to
either of <tt>f1()</tt> or <tt>f2()</tt>.  This variable could be declared as
a static call with a declaration like:
<p>
<pre>
    DEFINE_STATIC_CALL(target, f1);
</pre>
<p>
Initially, <tt>target</tt> will point to <tt>f1()</tt>.  Changing it to
point to <tt>f2()</tt> requires a call like:
<p>
<pre>
    static_call_update(target, f2);
</pre>
<p>
Actually calling the function pointed to by <tt>target</tt> is done with
<tt>static_call()</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    static_call(target, args...);
</pre>
<p>
Since changing the target of a call involves code patching, it is an
expensive operation and should not be done often.  One possible use case for
static calls is tracepoints in the kernel, which can have an arbitrary
function attached to them, but which are not often changed.  Using a static
call for that attachment can reduce the runtime overhead of enabling a
tracepoint.
<p>
This patch set has been through a couple of revisions so far.  It
implements two different mechanisms.  The first tracks all call
sites for each static call variable and patches each of them when the
target changes; the
second stores the target in a trampoline and all calls jump through there.
The motivations for the two approaches are not spelled out, but one can
imagine that the direct calls will be a little faster, while the trampoline
will be quicker and easier to patch when the target changes.

<p>
<h4>Relpolines/optpolines</h4>
<p>
A rather more involved and general-purpose approach can be seen in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181018005420.82993-1-namit@vmware.com/">this patch
set</a> posted by Nadav Amit in October.  Rather than requiring developers
to change indirect call sites by hand, Amit adds a new mechanism that
optimizes indirect calls on the fly.
<p>
The patch set uses some "<q>assembly macro magic</q>" to change how
every retpoline injected into the kernel works; the new version contains
both fast and slow paths.  The fast path is a test and direct call to the
most frequently called target (hopefully) from any retpoline, while the
slow path is the old retpoline mechanism.  In the normal production mode,
the fast path should mitigate the retpoline overhead in a large fraction of
the calls from that site.
<p>
What makes this work interesting is the selection of the target for the
fast path.  Each "relpoline" (a name that was deemed too close to
"retpoline" for comfort and which, as a result, may be renamed to something
like "optpoline") starts out in a learning mode where it builds a hash
table containing the actual target for each call that is made.  After a
sufficient number of calls, the most frequently called target is
patched directly into the code, and the learning mode ends.  To follow
changing workloads, relpolines are put back into the learning mode after
one minute of operation, a period that Amit says "<q>might be too
aggressive</q>".
<p>
This mechanism has the advantage of optimizing all indirect calls, not just
the ones identified as a problem by a developer.  It can also operate on
indirect calls added in loadable modules at any point during the system's
operation.  The results, he says, are "<q>not bad</q>"; they include
a 10% improvement in an nginx benchmark.  Even on a system with retpolines
disabled, simply optimizing the indirect calls yields a 2% improvement for
nginx.  The downside, of course, is the addition of a fair amount of
low-level complexity to implement this mechanism.
<p>
Response to this patch set has been muted but generally positive.  There
are, though, lots of suggestions on the details of how this mechanism would
work.  There may be further optimizations to be had by storing more than
one common target, for example.  The learning mechanism can probably
benefit from some improvement.  There was also a suggestion to use a GCC
plugin rather than the macro magic to insert the new call mechanism into
the kernel.  As a result, the patch set is still under development and will
likely take some time yet to be ready.
<p>
<h4>What's next</h4>
<p>
Various other developers have been working on the indirect call problem as
well.  Edward Cree, for example, has posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cf6e9449-f3f6-e0fc-8096-eaba6b5a3b97@solarflare.com/">a
patch set</a> adding a simple learning mechanism to static calls.  Nearly
one year after the Spectre vulnerability was disclosed, the development
community is clearly still trying to do something about the performance
costs the Spectre mitigations have imposed.
<p>

The current round of fixes is trying to recover the performance lost when
the indirect branch predictor was taken out of the picture.  As Cree <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/7ab6063d-92ac-4708-d820-0cf175cf0f92@solarflare.com/">put
it</a>: "<q>Essentially we're doing indirect branch prediction in
software because the hardware can't be trusted to get it right; this is
sad</q>".  Merging four different approaches (at least) to this problem
may not be the best solution, especially since this particular
vulnerability should eventually be fixed in the hardware, rendering all of
the workarounds unnecessary.  Your editor would not want to speculate on
which of the above patches, if any, will make it into the mainline,
though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

There are other good reasons to optimize indirect calls into direct ones. If you can figure out what code can and can't be called by a function pointer, you could optimize out the code that can't be called, and even inline the only possible code in a given kernel configuration.<br>

In compilers this is called devirtualization and recent GCC versions can do this automatically for C++ at least. Java's JIT does this too and it's one of the biggest advantages of JIT over AOT as it knows for real what can and cannot be called and what is the distribution of probabilities of targets. A very smart compiler could in theory recognize the pattern in C and optimize it too, but since this is not a concept of the language itself, I wouldn't count on it really.<br>

I don't fully understand how relpolines prevent speculation. Win't the CPU itself also learn the most common case and speculate along it? "OK, this if usually takes the true branch, and then there is a direct call right there, and then it loads this yummy stuff into memory, let's do that speculatively".<br>

Sure, in fact you hope that it will: then the cost of those if() branches will be zero.  It's a different piece of the branch predictor though, than the one that was using a poison-able/shared target cache.  The if() way may be able to be biassed to speculate the wrong call, but it will still only call one of the functions you've compiled into your code, not an exploit.  Also there is probably much less chance of causing the function pointer to be wildly wrong, compared to a wildly-wrong out-of-range array index.  Ideally though you'd fix the hardware, so that the various "hidden" cache state was localized to protection domains along with the rest of memory....<br>

The branch predictor for indirect call is shared and unrelated processes can make it to speculate to jump to an arbitrary address. The conditional direct jumps as used by the if statements can only jump to the wrong branch of the if. The exploit is possible only when the code uses a particular not so frequent pattern and the defense when necessary does not cost as much as trampolines.<br>

Retpolines don't prevent speculation, they just give the branch prediction logic a harmless path to speculate into. Speculation occurs into an infinite loop to self (with an optimization hint to the hw via a "pause" instruction so it doesn't actually consume cycles on the loop).<br>

      This comment seems to nicely illustrate the fact that "relpoline" is indeed a name <em><q>too close to "retpoline" for comfort</q></em>.

For a research project a few years ago I set up a prototype system somewhat similar to the "optpolines" described here -- it used perf to profile a running workload and discover common indirect call targets, and then took a whole syscall path and used LTO to compile a version of it with all indirect calls de-indirected and even inlined (with a guard check that fell back to the original code of course) to generate an optimized version of the hot code path for that specific running system (from syscall entry points all the way down to device drivers), which it then spliced into the running system as a livepatch.<br>
<p>
While I was working on it the results weren't quite dramatic enough to justify pursuing it further, but this was well before Spectre -- perhaps it just wasn't timed right...<br>

All these optimizations are suspiciously similar to the "inline caches" used to optimize method calls in dynamic languages!<br>

It was not only dynamic languages. Some compilers for object-oriented languages replace virtual calls by few ifs that check for all known classes and call the corresponding method statically. This was done, for example, in SmallEiffel compiler 20 years ago. <br>
<p>
The indirect branch prediction on CPU made that optimization largely unnecessary, but now we are back to it as the prediction turned out to be a security nightmare.<br>

      <blockquote>Indirect function calls [...] have never been blindingly fast</blockquote>

Actually, in my measurements correctly predicted indirect calls have been as fast as direct calls on Intel-compatible CPUs for a decade or two.  That obviated the need for inline caching, so it's not surprising that all the papers on inline caching are more than two decades old.

In large applications the indirect branch predictor runs out of capacity so inline caches are still very useful.<br>

The world is contiuously redoing the same things. I used to do this almost 10 years ago in haproxy ( <a href="http://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy.git;a=commitdiff;h=531cf0">http://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy.git;a=commitdiff;h=531cf0</a>  ) and slightly more than a year ago, when explaining this code to someone, I said "I know it looks strange, this is old, dating when CPUs were not able to predict indirect branches, now we could get rid of this". Then spectre/meltdown arrived and I was very happy not to have touched that code :-)<br>

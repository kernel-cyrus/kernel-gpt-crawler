<h1>CXL 2: Pooling, sharing, and I/O-memory resources</h1>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 19, 2022</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
During the final day of the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM), attention in the
memory-management track turned once again to the challenges posed by the
upcoming Compute Express Link (CXL) technology.  Two sessions looked at
different problems posed by CXL memory, which can come and go over the
operation of the system.  CXL offers a lot of flexibility, but changes will
be needed for the kernel to be able to take advantage of it.

<p>
<h4>Pooled and shared memory</h4>
<p>
Hongjian Fan, who led one of <a href="/Articles/894598/">Tuesday's CXL
sessions</a> returned on Wednesday (via videoconference) for a discussion
that was 
dedicated to pooled and shared memory.  These are concepts that apply to memory
appliances, where the goals are to share memory across multiple systems,
improve memory utilization and, naturally, to reduce costs.  Sharing
memory from a central appliance can reduce the need to put large amounts of
memory into every server; when a given machine needs more, it can get a
temporary allocation from the appliance.
<p>
Pooled memory is partitioned on the appliance and allocated in chunks to
servers, which only have access to the memory that has been given to them.
Requesting memory from a pooled appliance creates a hotplug event, where
new memory suddenly becomes addressable.  Supporting pooled memory requires
the ability to generate and manage the hotplug events, as well as a
virtual-device driver 
that monitors memory use and requests or releases memory as appropriate.

</blockquote>
<p>
Shared memory is, instead, shared across all servers, though it will
probably not be possible for any given server to allocate it all.  With a
shared appliance, the memory is always in each server's physical address
space, but it may not all be usable.  The kernel can provide a sysfs file
that indicates which memory is available at any given time; tracking of
allocations can done by the appliance or via communication between servers,
though the latter mode can create a lot of traffic.
<p>
Dave Hansen said that CXL memory behaves a lot like RAM today, but it requires
some extra care.  There may be cache-coherency issues not present with RAM,
and the kernel can't keep any of its own data structures in this memory
since those structures cannot be moved and would thus block removal.  Fan
said that cache coherency is part of
the CXL protocol and shouldn't be a problem.  Hansen added that there is
little that is new with CXL memory appliances, they are much like how
memory is managed with virtualization.  But now it is being done in
hardware, which scares him a bit.  Memory removal success is "a matter of
luck" now, he said, and calling this memory "CXL" won't change that.
<p>
An attendee asked what the benefit of the shared mode was, given
that all memory will still be used exclusively by one system at any given
time.  Fan answered that the problem with pooled access is fast and reliable
hotplugging, while the problem with shared access is communication between
the systems.  Hansen asked how access to shared memory is cut off when
memory is reallocated, but Fan was unable to answer the question.
<p>
Dan Williams said that access control is not really visible to the kernel, and
that it was necessary to "trust the switch".  He added that users want to
be able to manage this memory with the existing NUMA APIs, but they also
want hard guarantees that it will be possible to remove memory from a
system; those two goals are in conflict.  It will be necessary to reset
expectations about removal, he said; it will be a learning experience for
the industry.  Hansen said that the use of hotplug will be no different in
this scenario, but Williams said there will now be a whole new level of
software behind hotplug to manage the physical address space.  That is
something that the firmware has always done, but now the kernel will have
to deal with it; the CXL specification group is still trying to figure out
the details of how that will work.
<p>
Fan said some other changes will be necessary as well.  There will need to
be a mechanism to warn about available capacity on the appliance.  Since
memory can be requested and added to the system on the fly, the
out-of-memory handler should perhaps wait for more memory to materialize
before it starts killing processes.  David Hildenbrand said that the
out-of-memory scenario scares him; people think that it's possible to just
wait for memory to appear, but it's not true.  If the system is going into
the out-of-memory state, there will be other
allocations failing at the same time.  What is needed is a way to determine
that the system is short of memory, then wait for more memory in a safe
way, before running out.  Hansen added that plugging in more memory is an
act that, in itself, requires allocating memory, and an out-of-memory
situation is not a good time to try to do that.  Williams said, as the
session came to a close, that the system cannot be reactionary, and that
memory requirements should be handled in user space at the job-scheduling
level. 
<p>
<h4>Managing the resource tree</h4>
<p>
Management of the physical address space was the topic of the second CXL
session of the day.
The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.17.8/source/include/linux/ioport.h#L21"><tt>resource</tt>
structure</a> is one of the oldest data structures in the kernel; it was
added in the 2.3.11 release in 1999.  Its job is to track the resources
available to the system and, in the form of the <tt>iomem_resource</tt>
variable, the layout of the computer's physical address space.  It forms a
tree structure with some resources (a PCI bus, for example) containing 
other resources (attached devices) within their address ranges.  This tree is
represented in <tt>/proc/iomem</tt>, which must be opened as root to show
the actual addresses involved.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/895430/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lsfmm/BenWidawsky-sm.png" alt="[Ben Widawsky]"
title="Ben Widawsky" class="rthumb"></a>

The kernel's I/O-memory resource tree was not designed with CXL in mind;
for Linus Torvalds to have been so short-sighted in 1999 is perhaps
forgivable.  But, said Ben Widawsky in his session,
that shortcoming is threatening to create problems now.  In current
systems, <tt>iomem_resource</tt> is initially created from the memory map
provided by the boot firmware; architecture-specific code and drivers then
modify it and subdivide the resources there as needed.  Once a given range
of physical address space has been assigned to a specific use, it can never
be reassigned — only subdivided.
<p>
The core of the problem is that CXL memory can come and go, and it may not
be present at boot time.  When this memory is added, it essentially
overrides a piece of the physical address space, which is something that
<tt>iomem_resource</tt> is not prepared to handle.  If the space used by
CXL were disjoint from local system resources, Widawsky said, there
wouldn't be a problem; traditional resources could be put into one range,
and CXL in another.  But that is not how things are going to work.  RAM
added via CXL will overlap the space already described by
<tt>iomem_resource</tt>.  What, he asked, can be done to properly represent
these resources?
<p>
Mike Rapoport questioned the need to put CXL memory into
<tt>iomem_resource</tt> at all.  The problem, Hansen explained, is that CXL
memory might be the only memory in the system.  People tend to see CXL as a
sort of add-on card, but it is closer to the core than that.  On a system
using only CXL, it would not be possible to boot without having that memory
represented in <tt>iomem_resource</tt>.  David Hildenbrand said that
<tt>iomem_resource</tt> should describe everything in the system.
<p>
Widawsky said that there is a need to keep device-private memory from
taking address space intended for CXL; this is another reason to represent
CXL memory in the resource tree.  He suggested that attempts to take pieces
of memory assigned to CXL should be blocked.  Hildenbrand suggested creating
the CXL region as a device and adding some special calls to allocate space
from that region.  This could be tricky, Widawsky said.  System RAM may
already be set up in the resource tree; making it part of a special device
would involve reparenting that RAM, which, he said, has never been done.
Matthew Wilcox contradicted the "never been done" claim, but without
details on when it had been done.
<p>
John Hubbard said that the kernel should keep <tt>iomem_resource</tt> as
"the one truth" about the layout of the physical address space.  Williams
said that <tt>struct resource</tt> is old; there are people around who love
to add new structures to the kernel, perhaps the time has come to do that
for this problem.  Wilcox referenced a "20-year-old patch" in Andrew
Morton's tree, but didn't identify it.  Hildenbrand said that the structure
as a whole is difficult to traverse and work with; any work to improve it
would be appreciated.
<p>
Widawsky asked if there was a path to a solution that involved a bit less
hard work.  Williams suggested adding resources in smaller chunks, with a
number of entries for the CXL CFMWS ("fixed memory window structures")
areas.  Some of those entries could later be removed, Widawsky added, if it
turned out they weren't being used for CXL memory.
<p>
The session came to an end with Wilcox asking what would happen in response
to a discovery that an assigned resource's range is too small.  Could it be
expanded somehow?  Williams said it would be good to be able to update the
address map as more information became available.  All told, the session
described a problem but did not get close to finding a solution.  This is a
problem that has been seen in numerous other contexts as computers have
become more dynamic.  Solutions have been found in the past and will surely
be found this time too, but it may be challenging to find one that doesn't
involve a fair amount of hard work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I think a lot of people are confused about how CXL memory is going to work. Trying to munge it in memory hotplug is just going to be hopelessly broken. The problem is that the receiving system does not actually own that memory. The memory appliance does. Suppose that you have a CXL memory device with gobs of memory. The compute machines that are attached will request memory and give it back. But what happens if $VENDOR driver pukes over kernel memory and causes a kernel panic. The exciting data that gets written back to the appliance doesn&#x27;t matter so much as what the device does in response to the fact that the machine that is bleeding out has some of its memory. A sane spec will have a mechanism for the appliance to say, &quot;You are giving up this memory NOW!&quot;<br>
<p>
So if you want the kernel to manage this memory there will have to be two separate concepts, the memory the device owns and cannot be taken away, and memory that it does not own and subject to being ripped away. I&#x27;m half of the mind that a better model for this is to expose remote CXL devices in /dev/ and then mmap() that like a normal &#x27;file&#x27;. <br>

The kernel has had at least some support for memory disappearing underneath it for a long time -- ECC RAM can say &quot;whoops, this RAM suddenly doesn&#x27;t work anymore, sorry!&quot; and the kernel will try to recover gracefully. (E.g. it might kill the process that owns that memory but the rest of the system will keep going.)<br>

I have no idea how well or poorly this will extend to CXL failure modes, but it&#x27;s at least precedented.<br>

I&#x27;d expect this though to be segmented off into the Epyc line only though.  At least for a generation or two simply because I don&#x27;t expect anything close to the consumer level to be supporting CXL until hardware manufacturers start demanding it.<br>

One has to distinguish here between CXL, CXL.mem and what zealous vendors promise CXL.mem can do. I have my doubts about the latter, but there&#x27;s definitely compelling use cases for CXL.mem, and CXL itself is kind of too useful and big to fail at this point.<br>

And, yes, the kernel needed (and still needs more) modification to support it well.<br>

It&#x27;s funny you bring it up though, since one of the use cases is to put PMem on CXL.<br>

<p>
You can buy a 256Gb module for an affordable $3,386.99 , a 512Gb module is on a discount right now at $9,768.99<br>
<p>
It&#x27;s fair to say that Optane memory is vaporware compared to the initial vision of systems with tens of terabytes of persistent RAM.<br>

As opposed to a 32GB DIMM for $560?<br>

It&#x27;s not &quot;vaporware&quot; just because you don&#x27;t want to pay for it. And you can buy an Exadata X9M with 18TB of PMem per rack (admittedly that&#x27;s spread over three servers each with 6TB). I did think we&#x27;d have more capacity by now (about double what we have). But an undershoot on capacity is hardly the same thing as &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;. It was always going to be a high-end option.<br>

You can buy them much cheaper: <a href="https://memory.net/product/m393aag40m32-cae-samsung-1x-128gb-ddr4-3200-rdimm-pc4-25600r-quad-rank-x4-module/">https://memory.net/product/m393aag40m32-cae-samsung-1x-12...</a><br>
<p>
But yep, this means that the persistent RAM is pretty much a non-entity now. It needs special chipsets, it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s not available through most cloud computing providers.<br>
<p>
CXL will likely be similar once people find out that it&#x27;s nowhere close in speed to normal RAM.<br>

I was comparing apples-to-apples. PMem from this vendor vs DRAM from this vendor. PMem is cheaper per bit than DRAM, just as promised. It&#x27;s more expensive per bit than NAND, also as promised. It&#x27;s available in large capacities, so the price of a DIMM is high.<br>
<p>
If you were expecting it in your laptop by now, then you weren&#x27;t paying attention. You also don&#x27;t have 100Gbps networking in your laptop, but it very much exists.<br>

I think I&#x27;m done here. You said something stupid and hyperbolic; now you&#x27;re determined to Be Right. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what the facts are.<br>

Except that it&#x27;s not. At best it&#x27;s about the same, and certainly machines with tens of terabytes of NVRAM are in the realm of exoticware for at least a decade more. This situation is far away from the hyped state where NVRAM was going to be ubiquitous.<br>

<p>
I have 40Gbps networking at home, and it&#x27;s not even that expensive. It&#x27;s not in my laptop (for some reason adapters max out at 10GBps), but I certainly can use it otherwise.<br>

It&#x27;s always amuses me that hardware companies develop and ship products before getting kernel support ready. Who is gonna use their products?<br>
Or HW vendors designing CPU features conflicting with the way Linux operates (like Intel&#x27;s memory tags). It&#x27;s like they sit in a cave, completely ignoring software supposed to run on their silicon. <br>

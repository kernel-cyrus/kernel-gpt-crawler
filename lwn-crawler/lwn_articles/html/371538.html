           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 27, 2010</br>

Linux has long had the <tt>mincore()</tt> system call which allows an
application to determine whether a given page is in RAM or not.  There is
no easy way, though, to tell whether a given page from a file is in the
page cache or not.  An application can <tt>mmap()</tt> the file and use
<tt>mincore()</tt> on it, but that can be slow.  So Chris Frost has
proposed a new <tt>fincore()</tt> system call to handle this task:
<p>
<pre>
    int fincore(int fd, loff_t start, loff_t len, unsigned char *vec);
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>fincore()</tt> will look at the pages of the file associated
with <tt>fd</tt> in the range indicated by <tt>start</tt> and
<tt>len</tt>.  For each page of the file, one byte of <tt>vec</tt> will be
set to a non-zero value if that page is in memory.  Naturally, this answer
is an approximation - the situation can change while the system call is
running.
<p>
That, however, can be good enough for Chris's needs.  His objective is to
speed up applications which perform large numbers of non-sequential file
reads.  The traditional readahead code deals poorly with this kind of
application, since the access pattern cannot be predicted ahead of time.
But the application often <i>does</i> know about a sequence of reads in
advance; if the kernel could be told to pull in those pages ahead of time,
it could order the I/O operations optimally and make the whole thing go
faster.  When doing this for sqlite and the GIMP, Chris reports significant
speedups.
<p>
The <tt>fadvise()</tt> system call can be used to request prefetching of
file data.  But there's a problem: it's hard for a prefetch library to know
how much system memory is available.  If too little data is prefetched, the
performance gains will not be what they could be.  Prefetching too much
data, however, can lead to thrashing.  Hence the <tt>fincore()</tt> system
call: if prefetched pages are no longer present by the time the application
gets around to using them, the library knows that it is asking for too much
and can back off.
<p>
Andrew Morton <a href="/Articles/371540/">likes the patch</a>:

	I must say, the syscall appeals to my inner geek.  Lot of
	applications are leaving a lot of time on the floor due to bad disk
	access patterns.  A really smart library which uses this facility

<p>
Jamie Lokier, though, <a href="/Articles/371541/">wondered</a> if it might
not be a better idea to find a way to inform applications more directly
that their pages are being evicted prior to use.
<p>
This is the first posting for this system call, so it has not gotten a lot
of attention yet; more discussion will certainly be necessary before it
could be merged.  In the mean time, the <a

It seems to me like, once you're using both fadvise() and a non-portable syscall, you could inform the kernel in more detail about your actual usage pattern, and it could store the info and decide what to do. The system should be able to make good choices if you could tell the kernel, in order, the pages you intend to use (up until the kernel tells you it doesn't want to store any more hints for you), and have the kernel only prefetch up to where it can fit in memory, prefer to drop the ones which are further out (and likely newest rather than oldest), and remember what you've requested that isn't in memory such that when you drop your interest in the pages you've passed, it can prefetch new ones then.<br>
<p>
It doesn't make sense to have a userspace heuristic for figuring out kernel limits when you need kernel support to implement it, particularly if the information you're getting only helps if you are right about the kernel's heuristics. Maybe the kernel will stop evicting pages that have been requested but not used when asked to prefetch more pages, and heuristics based on checking whether pages are in core and an assumption as to the kernel's use of the hints will give entirely wrong results.<br>

      I agree.  First of all, fadvise() does <em>not</em> request prefetch.  It advises the kernel that you are going to access a certain part of the file soon.  It is up to the prefetcher to decide how to exploit that information.
<p>
Only the prefetcher, in the kernel, can properly decide how much memory to allocate for prefetching this particular file.  Memory is a resource shared between processes, and coordinating resource usage between processes is fundamentally the kernel's responsibility.  The application should just look out for itself.

Hmm, it seems there's an assumption here about the page size. It's not immediately clear if you mean 4K or 1K pages. So I think that should be made explicit somehow, like by vec getting a length argument.<br>
<p>
But other than that I think it's a fabulous idea. Although you could achieve much the same benefits if you could do a read() and have it also return a flag indicating if the data was all in memory or not.<br>

<h1>An introduction to compound pages</h1>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>November 11, 2014</br>
           </div>
Your editor was digging through a patch set that makes changes involving
compound pages when he realized that his understanding of these pages
was a bit on the weak side.  After some time digging through the source to
rectify that situation, a thought surfaced: the world must be full of
people wishing they knew more about compound pages.  For all of you whose
list of desired lifetime accomplishments includes a better understanding of
this subject, here is a quick introduction to compound pages in the Linux
kernel.
<p>
A compound page is simply a grouping of two or more physically contiguous
pages into a unit that can, in many ways, be treated as a single, larger
page.  They are most commonly used to create huge pages, used within <a
href="/Articles/374424/">hugetlbfs</a> or the <a
href="/Articles/423584/">transparent huge pages</a> subsystem, but they
show up in other contexts as well.
Compound pages can serve as anonymous memory or be used as buffers
within the kernel; they cannot, however, appear in the page cache, which is
only prepared to deal with singleton pages.
<p>
Allocating a compound page is a matter of calling a normal memory
allocation function like
<tt>alloc_pages()</tt> with the <tt>__GFP_COMP</tt> allocation flag set and
an order of at least one.  It is not possible to create an order-zero
(single-page) compound page due to the way compound pages are implemented.
(The "order" of an allocation is the base-2 logarithm of the number of
pages to allocate; zero thus corresponds to a single page, one to two
pages, etc.).
<p>
Note that a compound page differs from the pages returned from a normal
higher-order allocation request.  A call like:
<p>
<pre>
    pages = alloc_pages(GFP_KERNEL, 2);  /* no __GFP_COMP */
</pre>
<p>
will return four physically contiguous pages, but they will not be a
compound page.  The difference is that creating a compound page involves
the creation of a fair amount of metadata; much of the time, that metadata
is unneeded so the expense of creating it can be avoided.

<p>
So what does that metadata look like?  Since most of it is stored in the
associated <tt>page</tt> structures, one can assume that <a
href="/Articles/565097/">it's complicated</a>.  Let's start with the page
flags.  The first (normal) page in a compound page is called the "head
page"; it has the <tt>PG_head</tt> flag set.  All other pages are "tail
pages"; they are marked with <tt>PG_tail</tt>.  At least, that is the case
on systems where page flags are not in short supply — 64-bit systems, in
other words.  On 32-bit systems, there are no page flags to spare, so a
different scheme is used; all pages in a compound page have the
<tt>PG_compound</tt> flag set, and the tail pages have <tt>PG_reclaim</tt>
set as well.  The <tt>PG_reclaim</tt> bit is normally used by the page
cache code, but, since compound pages cannot be represented in the page
cache, that flag can be reused here.
<p>
Code dealing with compound pages need not worry about the different
marking conventions, though.  No matter which convention is in use, a call
to <tt>PageCompound()</tt> will return a 
true value if the passed-in page is a compound page.  Head and tail pages
can be distinguished, should the need arise, with <tt>PageHead()</tt> and
<tt>PageTail()</tt>. 
<p>
Every tail page has a pointer to the head page stored in the
<tt>first_page</tt> field of <tt>struct page</tt>.  This field occupies the
same storage as the <tt>private</tt> field, the spinlock used when the page
holds page table entries, or the <tt>slab_cache</tt> pointer used when the
page is owned by a slab allocator.  The <tt>compound_head()</tt> helper
function can be used to find the head page associated with any tail page.
<p>
There is a bit of information describing the compound page as a whole: the
order (size) of the page, and a destructor used to return the page to the
system when it is no longer needed.  One might first think to store that
information in the head page's <tt>struct page</tt>, but there is no room
for it there.  Instead, the order is stored in the <tt>lru.prev</tt> field
in the <tt>page</tt> structure for the first <i>tail</i> page.  While unions are
used for many of the overlaid 
fields in <tt>struct page</tt>, here the order is simply cast into a
pointer type before being stored in a pointer field.  Similarly, a pointer
to the destructor is stored in the <tt>lru.next</tt> field of the first
tail page's <tt>struct page</tt>.  This extension of compound-page metadata
into the second <tt>page</tt> structure is why compound pages must consist
of at least two pages.
<p>
Incidentally, there are only two compound page destructors declared in the
kernel.  By default, <tt>free_compound_page()</tt> is used; all it does is
return the memory to the page allocator.  The hugetlbfs subsystem, though,
uses <tt>free_huge_page()</tt> to keep its accounting up to date.
<p>
In most cases, compound pages are
unnecessary and ordinary allocations can be used; calling code needs to
remember how many pages it allocated, but otherwise the metadata that would
be stored in a compound page is unneeded.  A compound page is indicated,
though, whenever it is important to treat the group of pages as a whole
even if somebody references a single page within it.  Transparent huge
pages are a classic example; if user space attempts to change the
protections on a portion of a huge page, the entire huge page will need to
be located and broken up.  Various drivers also use compound pages to ease
the management of larger buffers.
<p>
And that is pretty much everything that distinguishes a compound page from
an ordinary, higher-order allocation.  Most developers will not encounter
compound pages in their area of the kernel.  In cases where it is truly
necessary to treat a set of pages as a single unit, though, compound pages
may well be part of the solution toolkit.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yes! A fascinating article, thank you. There's enough desperate thrashing about to squash stuff into the limited available space in the <tt>struct page</tt> that having a reference for it is very useful (particularly the really weird parts like the order storage).

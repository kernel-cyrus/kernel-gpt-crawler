           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 13, 2023</br>
           </div>
The kernel's software-interrupt ("softirq") mechanism was added prior to
the 1.0 kernel release, but it implements a design seen in systems that were
already old when Linux was born.  For much of that time, softirqs have been
an impediment to the kernel community's scalability and response-time
goals, but they have proved resistant to removal.  A recent discussion on a
proposed new heuristic to mitigate a softirq-related performance problem
may have reinvigorated interest in doing something about this subsystem
as a whole rather than just tweaking the parameters of how it operates.
<p>
Hardware interrupts are generated when some component of the system needs
the CPU's attention to, for example, deal with a completed I/O operation.
The processing of hardware interrupts is one of the highest-priority tasks
in the kernel; an interrupt will preempt almost anything else that might be
running, so the amount of work done in interrupt handlers must be kept to a
minimum to avoid adversely affecting the rest of the system.  The softirq
mechanism was designed to allow hardware-interrupt handlers to set aside
work to be done urgently — but not quite as urgently as hardware-interrupt
processing.
<p>
The subsystems that use software interrupts include networking, timers, the
block subsystem, read-copy-update (RCU), and tasklets.  When one of these
subsystems has work to delegate to a softirq handler, it will "raise" a
softirq by setting a bit in a special mask.  When the kernel
is in a position to handle software interrupts — usually either
at the end of hardware-interrupt processing or on return from a system call
— it will make a pass over the raised softirqs and call the appropriate
handler for each.
<p>
In practice, a softirq raised out of a hardware-interrupt handler will
often be
run immediately after that hardware handler finishes, but that is not
necessarily the case.  Softirqs can also be raised out of any (kernel)
context, not just while responding to hardware interrupts; the RCU softirq,
for example, is not tied to any hardware interrupt at all.
<p>
The problem here is that there may be a lot of work for the softirq
handlers to do.  They are invoked for, among other things, packets received
from the network and RCU callbacks and, by the time the handlers run, there
may be thousands of each waiting.  So softirq processing can go on for a
long time, to the detriment of the rest of the work the system is meant to
be doing.  This problem gets worse if, as can easily happen, <i>more</i>
work shows up while softirq handling is happening.
<p>
<h4>Managing softirq handling</h4>
<p>
To avoid overwhelming the system with softirq processing, a number of
heuristic mechanisms have been added to the kernel over time.  These
include:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> The function that normally processes software interrupts (<a
     href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/softirq.c#L528"><tt>__do_softirq()</tt></a>)
     will pass over all of the raised softirqs and process them.  Once that
     is done, it checks if more softirqs are pending; should that be the
     case, it will go back to the beginning — but only for a maximum of ten
     times.  If that count is exceeded, the kernel stops processing
     softirqs and, instead, wakes the per-CPU <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> kernel
     thread to continue the work.
<li> Similarly, if softirq processing continues for more than
     (approximately) 2ms, the remaining work will be punted to
     <tt>ksoftirqd</tt>.
<li> Whenever the <tt>ksoftirqd</tt> thread is running on a given CPU, the
     kernel will not even try to process software interrupts there; it will
     just leave them for the thread to handle.
<li> When the kernel <i>is</i> processing software interrupts, it will
     occasionally check the current process (the one that was preempted to
     handle softirqs) for the <tt>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</tt> flag, which
     indicates that a higher-priority process is ready to run.  In that
     case, it will stop processing softirqs to defer to that process.
</ul>
<p>
Some of the subsystems using software interrupts also implement limits in
their own handlers, independent of anything that the central softirq code
manages (or even knows about).
<p>
Toward the end of December, Jakub Kicinski posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221222221244.1290833-1-kuba@kernel.org/">a patch
set</a> (under the title "<q>uncontroversial change</q>") addressing a
problem that has been encountered with the last heuristic listed above.
The deferral of softirq processing when the kernel wants to reschedule was
meant to allow low-latency processing of events.  If some audio data comes
in, for example, a recorder application will want be able to run and to
grab it quickly.  But if the process that runs after reschedule is not
quick — if it holds onto the CPU for a long time — it will block all
softirq processing for that long time.  That can cause undesirable behavior
like networking stalls, TCP retransmissions, and more.
<p>
To fix the problem, Kicinski has proposed the addition of another
heuristic.  Once the rescheduling deferral happens, the kernel will only
wait 2ms before it starts handling softirqs again, regardless of whether
ksoftirqd is running; this will keep a long-running process from blocking
softirq processing for too long.  A similar timeout applies to deferrals
caused by an overload of softirqs — the first two items in the list above.
In that case, the kernel will restart handling softirqs after 100ms.  These
changes, he said, result in a tenfold reduction in networking stalls and a
50% drop in TCP retransmissions.
<p>
<h4>Addressing the real problem</h4>
<p>
Thomas Gleixner <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/87r0u6j721.ffs@tglx/">seemed
willing to accept the new timeouts</a>, though he added that he is
"<q>not a big fan of heuristical duct tape</q>".  He pointed out some
problems with the timekeeping; it is using the <tt>jiffies</tt> time
variable, which has a resolution of 1-10ms, for small-millisecond values.
That can lead to fairly widely varying results — a problem that, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87jzzxkgno.ffs@tglx/">he later realized</a>, exists
in current kernels as well.  But it didn't take much longer before he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/87r0u3hqtw.ffs@tglx/">complained about the whole
approach</a> which, he said, just makes the overall softirq problem worse.
<p>
Softirqs, he said, "<q>are just the proliferation of an at least 50 years
old OS design paradigm</q>".  They exist to allow certain code to
circumvent whatever resource management (CPU scheduling, for example) is in
place and, as a result, make it impossible to fully control the operation
of the system.  He grumbled that the usual approach when problems
inevitably turn up is to add more heuristics and knobs.  "<q>Can we please
stop twiddling a parameter here and there and go and fix this whole problem
space properly</q>?", he asked.  He also acknowledged that he did not have
a complete solution in mind, but promised to think about it in the near
future.
<p>
Kicinski <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230306165131.11b7b475@kernel.org/">said</a> that
the networking developers are trying to move processing out of software
interrupts, but that it is a long, slow process.  Frederic Weisbecker,
instead, <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/ZAXVF0tPKLErAkpT@lothringen/">pointed
out</a> the real problem with softirqs: only one of them can run at a time,
and there is kernel code that depends on that level of exclusion.  Nobody
really knows, after all these years, which softirq-handling code can safely
run concurrently with other handlers, and which cannot.  So
disabling of software-interrupt processing has taken on a role similar to
that of the unlamented big kernel lock and, like the big kernel lock,
softirqs are hard to safely get rid of.
<p>
The solution, he suggested, is a pushdown effort similar to <a
href="/Articles/283066/">what was done for the big kernel lock</a>.  All
softirq processing could be pushed into kernel threads, which would then be
scheduled in the normal way, but they would all start by running with the
equivalent of the softirq-disable big lock held.  As the handlers for
specific subsystems were proven safe, they could release that lock until,
someday, it would wither away entirely.  The task, he said, is not for the
faint of heart:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Of course this is going to be a tremendous amount of work but it
	has the advantage of being iterative and it will pay in the long
	run. Also I'm confident that the hottest places will be handled
	quickly. And most of them are likely to be in core networking code.
</blockquote>
<p>
All that is needed is somebody to actually do all of that work.
<p>
Matthew Garrett once <a href="/Articles/461720/">said</a> that
"<q>'heuristic' is an ancient African word meaning 'maybe bonghits will make
this problem more tractable'</q>".  Certainly software interrupts have been
the sort of intractable problem that can drive developers to such a remedy.
Perhaps, someday, this ancient subsystem will be cleaned out, urgent
processing will be done in a controlled manner, and the heuristics will no
longer be needed.  For now, though, they are still necessary, and Kicinski's
patch may be the sort of bandage that makes them work a little better for a
little longer while the real problem is being solved.  After all, even
though the development community will surely deal with softirqs for real
this time, this work is likely to take a while to come to fruition.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Fundamentally, humans aren't good about thinking in terms of concurrent modifications - our brains like "first this, then that, then either this or that" sequences, and not "this and this and this in unknown order, then that and that in unknown order". A big global lock is a great way to ensure that there are no concurrent modifications; even better if it's implicit and thus compile-time, rather than something you have to remember to lock before you do your work.

      <p>If a (fictional) word in one African language means something, does that make that word less African if the word does not exist (or has a different meaning) in any of the other thousands of African languages? Matthew Garrett didn't say <b>the</b> African language.</p>

      I guess I'm not sure I understand the objection.  Would it have been better if he'd said it was an ancient "Igbo" word - even though it obviously is not?  Or if he'd said it was an ancient Indo-European word?  Please educate me.

The agglomeration of all the diverse cultures and peoples in Africa into a single "African" culture or people is a tired racist trope with colonialism overtones. You would never say "ancient European language" in the same way.<br>

<p>
Why not?<br>
<p>
If I talk about Middle High German or Old English, I clearly subsume them as "ancient European languages". I would also add Latin and old variations of Basque (a non Indo-European language!) to that class...<br>
<p>
In fact, the term "ancient European languages" (scholarly known as "Paleo-European languages") has its own Wikipedia entry!<br>
<p>
And don't come up and tell me that the Goths, Kelts, Romans, and Huns (there in owing to the grande invasion), have had a common culture. This is exactly the "agglomeration of all the diverse cultures and peoples in Europe" that you describe.<br>
<p>
Is this a racist trope? It might be that some Basque seperatistic extremists would agree to that; but I beg to differ. (FWIW: I like the Basque region -- they have one of the most exciting cuisines in Europe!)<br>
<p>
Since I'm living in the part of Europe that has successfully conquered the Roman Empire -- is it with colonialism overtones concerning Latin?<br>
<p>
Don't misunderstand me: We shall tell about and celebrate the differences of cultures on the African continent. But a "proverb" is meant as a quip that uses an archetype to bring some point across. Look, there are a lot of proverbs about German culture that we could interpret as offending, if you look at our current society. Nevertheless they are useful in many situations, and one should recognize them for what they are -- not a description of culture or reality, but an allegory.<br>

Hm.<br>
<p>
Your interlocutor is 100% right, in a very specific sense.  One could even say a *critical* sense.<br>
<p>
He's correct that quite a few people would *never* say "ancient European language" in the same way as "ancient African language".  The question is simply one of *who / whom* and under *what* circumstances.<br>
<p>
From the perspective of someone captured by critical consciousness, the turn of phrase "ancient African language" refers to the *oppressed*; therefore use of the term by an *oppressor* (typically but not necessarily referring to people of European ancestry) is by definition going to be a transgression requiring negative judgments ("outdated viewpoint", "tired racist trope with colonialism overtones").  The turn of phrase is evil in this case -- it clearly erases Africans.<br>
<p>
In constrast, the same turn of phrase "ancient African language" can very well be considered *virtuous* (e.g. "fresh viewpoint", "inspiring truism") when uttered by someone who is a part of the *oppressed* class and / or buys into critical consciousness dialectic (such as Kimberle Crenshaw, Judith Butler or Ibram X. Kendi).  The turn of phrase is good in this case -- it clearly exalts Africans.<br>
<p>
The term "ancient European language", valid as it has been for pretty much all of modern history, is *not* going to carry the same implication -- since the "agglomeration of all the diverse cultures and peoples in Europe" is *not* a sin from the critical consciousness perspective.  In fact, since it is the *oppressor* there who is being agglomerated, it is a *virtue* to use that turn of phrase.  Same as people captured by critical consciousness would consider it a virtue to remind everyone constantly of how "colonialist" said oppressors are.  The turn of phrase is good in this case -- it's totally not erasing Europeans, and we're so happy it is.<br>
<p>
You see, people captured by critical consciousness use the same *vocabulary* as the rest of us, but they don't use the same *dictionary*.  The dictionary changes depending on who's doing the talking, along the oppressor / oppressed axis characteristic of critical consciousness.<br>
<p>
In sum: whether this or that phrase would be "said in the same way", depends very heavily on the writer's status -- is he an "enemy" or a "friend" of the Hegelian dialectic proper of critical consciousness?  I am sure most people are consciously or unconsciously familiar with this dichotomy (though most are not familiar with the philosophical underpinnings of the works).<br>
<p>
----------<br>
<p>
Of course, for those of us who reject critical consciousness dialectic, this form of perceiving the world -- and therefore this form of treating others, like your interlocutor has done -- is divisive, relativistic casuistry, engineered to create a hateful "oppressor / oppressed" distinction, drive a cudgel between otherwise-friendly and collaborative people, and manipulate the audience into fear of raising their voices against the absurdity of critical consciousness and its tenets.  From my perspective, your comment is 100% truthful and correct.  But those pesky facts are not going to matter to anyone captured by critical consciousness.  To them, the fundamental question is who wields the power in the interaction -- and since you are an oppressor (or so they may assume due to your unwillingness to submit to them), you should not be allowed to have any power, period.<br>
<p>
To be blunt: it's not that "we don't understand it".  We do -- we get the mechanics and we've studied its origins.  It's that we see what critical consciousness is doing to our spaces, and reject it as evil.<br>

I appreciate your compliment (and I appreciate the work you have done too).<br>
<p>
As a bit of an aside:<br>
<p>
W.r.t the term "wokist", it's well-defined by a center-left scholar on the matter (former mathematician) called James Lindsay, who runs New Discourses and its embedded dictionary "Translations from the Wokish".  That is my source, at least.  <br>
<p>
That the term is popular with the right is not a surprise to me — woke ideology (critical consciousness to use the term they use in their scholarly papers) and right-wing ideology are a nearly 100% mutually-exclusive set of ideas.  Ultimately, it's a popular term because nearly everybody knows what it refers to.<br>
<p>
If you would like me to use a different term to express the same set of ideological beliefs, I am open to hearing suggestions.<br>
<p>
Thanks again and keep up the good work!  😊<br>

I was just commenting on the rabid anti-wokeism crowd not actually being able to define what it is they're so vehemently taking a stand against.  Or unwilling, because leaving it as a vague boogeyman is more useful.  Regardless, the term is now effectively more radioactive than Fukishima.<br>

"Rabid" is a dehumanizing way to refer to a large group of people who reject critical consciousness ideological tenets.  It is a direct contention that people who reject such ideas are akin to angry animals that cannot be reasoned with.<br>
<p>
Most Americans reject most tenets of critical consciousness, and almost all of the rest of non-Western Planet Earth (me included) find these tenets outright absurd.  Ask honestly one of these allegedly "rabid" people why they reject said tenets, you will often find principled, well-reasoned and well-founded objections to them, which perfectly explain their human discontent when these tenets are inflicted on them.<br>
<p>

<p>
I have already pointed out twice that there is a well-referenced definition of the term (and related terms), and how to find it.  More than that, I cannot do.  If you insist "none of these people can even define X", after being afforded the opportunity to read a written definition of X, I hope you realize your objection comes across to me as closed-minded and argumentative.<br>
<p>
Either way, I sincerely hope have a good day 😊<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; "Rabid" is a dehumanizing way to refer to a large group of people who reject critical consciousness ideological tenets. It is a direct contention that people who reject such ideas are akin to angry animals that cannot be reasoned with.</span><br>
<p>
I live in "Where woke goes to die" Florida.  (In a particularly "red" county, I might add)<br>
<p>
"Rabid" is an accurate description of that group of people; hyper-aggressively attacking anyone who is even perceived to disagree with them.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; I have already pointed out twice that there is a well-referenced definition of the term (and related terms), and how to find it.</span><br>
<p>
You are completely missing my point.  It's not that term doesn't have a well-defined meaning that is easy to locate; it's that the ones loudly and repeatedly using the term pejoratively are unable (or unwilling) to express that meaning, and by extension, explain why it's "bad".<br>
<p>
There are good reasons for that, of course -- because when explained plainly, taking a stand against the actual meaning of "woke" basically means that you're stating up front that you intend to be an objectively awful human being.  Incidentally, that isn't my personal interpretation.<br>
<p>
To go back to my home state of Florida, our governor has made a crusade against "woke" a core pillar of his political identity, successfully pushing for "anti-woke" legislation, removing local elected officials for being "too woke", and perhaps most infamously, attacking large businesses that express support for "woke" principles.  Naturally, the courts are filled with legal challenges.  During one of these trials, the Governor's general counsel had to define what "woke" meant, and the response was telling:  <br>
<p>
"The belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them." [1]<br>
<p>
That definition, made under penalty of perjury, tells you the governor (and by extension, the right-wing political establishment in Florida) knows exactly what they are saying, and also why they refuse to publicly acknowledge that meaning directly, instead preferring to just use an intentionally vague term.  The same sort of thing is repeating itself all over this nation, at both the local and national level.  The right has successfully made the term "woke" into a toxic boogeyman, and anyone who wants to actually use it positively (eg as you've cited) needs to use a different term or immediately end up on the defensive.<br>
<p>
[1] I can't be bothered to dig up a primary source, but this was widely reported in the news.  Here's a representative example:  <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/what-does-woke-mean-gov-desantis-officials-answer-during-andrew-warren-trial">https://www.fox13news.com/news/what-does-woke-mean-gov-de...</a><br>

If that's what the term really means, then you also have a good reason why Europeans hate it. We don't want to be dragged into American Discrimination Politics.<br>
<p>
We've got our own troubles at the moment with Harriet Harman who, having presumably been heavily discriminated against during her career because she's black, made comments about Jews that dropped her in hot water. Whether I like her political views or not, the fact she is black makes her a target and there's nothing she can do about it. My Jewish heritage is not obvious unless I *CHOOSE* to make it so ... (and I believe that was her point!)<br>

To be fair, anyone taking their term definitions from politicians is as gullible as anyone else believing politicians about budgetary or campaign promises.  When I, my friends, anyone I know in my circle, or the scholars I study, use the term, that idiocy uttered by the General Counsel of Florida is absolutely not what I have in mind -- it's a totally preposterous definition.<br>
<p>
(To be *perfectly clear* your interlocutor is clearly *not* one of those gullible people.)<br>
<p>
As such, your interlocutor is right that idiots have made it so that people like me have to /define/ the term upfront (and comments are not editable here, so no way to clarify meaning post-facto).  *Shrug*.<br>

I will say that I have come to strongly believe the divisive polarisation on every thing - where we seek to pigeonhole everyone as Blue or Green, so we can jump to labelling them as "good" or "evil" and reflexively back or dismiss their ideas - is highly corrosive to civil society. And we should resist that urge and push back against those tendencies. Judge ideas on their merits, not the person putting them forth; and acknowledge that people are mixed bags, no one or group has a monopoly on righteousness - the virtuous sometimes get it badly wrong, the misfits sometimes are right. <br>
<p>
Keep an open mind, stick to empathy and evidence, minimise judging things by association and bias.<br>

I'm sorry, there's only so much direct abuse I can tolerate before choosing to walk away from those who are constantly angry and espouse general hatred for anything different than themselves.  I take an especially dim view of folks that claim that &lt;others&gt; shouldn't even have the right to _exist_, much less participate in society.<br>

I would *also* take an extremely dim view of anyone with such reprehensible attitudes to other human beings, as in your last sentence. <br>
<p>
That said, I think it's a vanishingly small number of people who have such beliefs about anyone. I know such arguments exist though, on both sides of political spectra on a couple of issues. And I think there's a large degree of mis-attribution of the position of the other side, straw-manning, etc., in all such cases. And I think that's due to the increased silo-ing in modern, online societies, and the resultant tendencies to pigeon-hole the "other" side and dismiss all they say (ascribing of hyper-extreme, non-representative positions to /all/ of the "other side" being one way to easily dismiss).<br>

The article kind of elides the enormous magnitude of this regression:<br>
<p>
"We have a sirq latency tracker in our prod kernel which catches<br>
8ms+ stalls of net Tx (packets queued to the NIC but there is<br>
no NAPI cleanup within 8ms) and with these patches applied<br>
on 5.19 fully loaded web machine sees a drop in stalls from<br>
1.8 stalls/sec to 0.16/sec. I also see a 50% drop in outgoing<br>
TCP retransmissions and ~10% drop in non-TLP incoming ones.<br>
This is not a network-heavy workload so most of the rtx are<br>
due to scheduling artifacts."<br>
<p>
This is not a network-heavy workload, is a key phrase here. For many months now I have been observing a marked decline in observed bufferbloat via a variety of tools and metrics, and thinking that ah! our projects's efforts are finally taking hold...<br>
<p>
... instead, now I am thinking that with this bug, leading to great amounts of tcp "inefficiency", widely propagating to the vms and billions of containers of the world, as taking a great deal of pressure off the network. <br>
<p>
It would be (perversely?) nice to see a before/after rtt comparison with the bug as it lies, on multiple containerized and vm´d systems.<br>

As a non-kernel developer, if the top/bottom half (hard/soft irq) approach is a discredited(?) 50-year old design paradigm, what's the solution? Threaded irq's would appear to fix Gleixner's objections, and seems to be what the real-time Linux people in general like, but suffers from more (too much?) context-switching overhead? ksoftirqd is maybe some middle ground, but then you'll want to assign priorities to interrupt handlers, and maybe ksoftirqd should priority inherit the priority of the highest pending or currently processing softirq, you'll want to distribute softirq processing among available cpu's etc. etc., and at some point you're just reinventing the scheduler.. <br>

You're pointing out the fundamental issue with using shared threads to do deferrable, unattributed, work.  We see this in ksoftirqd.  We see it in workqueues.  These threads process generic work that have no associated priority.  There is no single policy that one can apply that doesn't degrade some other use-case.<br>
<p>
Suppose you have an application thread that contends with ksoftirqd for a CPU, and you feel your application is more important than network processing.  You elevate the priority of your application thread over ksoftirqd.  To your dismay, you discover that your application is now starving out timers, because thread wakeups are handled by ksoftirqd as well.  This may be an unacceptable trade-off, so you submit and let the ksoftirqd network work stomp on your application thread.  (I've been forced to make this trade-off half a dozen times.)<br>
<p>
Possibly one way forward is to assign CPU-scheduler-oriented priority (i.e., don't use a flag like HI_SOFTIRQ) to all work ksoftirqd work items, and let ksoftirqd's priority float with the work.  Adding priority inheritance is the next reasonable step.  This is a lot like how some microkernel services work.  This would require an API change and would probably be super disruptive!<br>
<p>
Maybe another approach would be to assign one thread to each tasklet-class (HI_SOFTIRQ, TIMER_SOFTIRQ, ...).  This would at least let one decouple timer processing from network processing.<br>

Having read about the Mill architecture now, I have at least two thoughts:<br>
1. Not exactly?  And details really, really matter for building instruction execution hardware, it’s about what you can get the wires to do<br>
2. Similarly, a valid architecture for higher level software doesn’t necessarily have much to do with a valid CPU design, which faces a very different set of problems<br>
<p>
Also, my reading of the Mill stuff gives me a vaguely gross feeling - they’re very proud and very defensive of it.  The proof is in the pudding and they don’t have any (and almost certainly won’t, but I get the sense this wouldn’t get them to admit they were wrong).<br>

Ahem.  Sorry for the rant.<br>

I think the mill, even as a paper design, has been highly influential. The talks sparked a lot of thought back when they were giving them. The idea of a processor that could context or priv switch in 5 clocks, compared to thousands, would give an immense real-world gain to many applications. <br>
<p>
Living with some new aspect of Spectre every year, seeing capabilities make it into an arm processor, seeing message passing make a comeback with io_uring, watching ebpf take off,<br>
makes me wish for something, even a virtual processor, that was more secure by design.<br>
<p>
The Mill instruction set continues to evolve, mostly in directions that I think are excessive, and I keep wishing, as always, that somehow, with all the great compiler development happening, that someone will manage to create a vm and compiler for it. <br>
<p>
Another thing I would like to see is dedicated cache for irq routines so as to always have consistent latency while servicing them. <br>
<p>
A new thing (I am getting seriously offtopic) now out there (not mill-related) is a possible new floating point standard, called posits: <a href="http://loyc.net/2019/unum-posits.html">http://loyc.net/2019/unum-posits.html</a> which I find sort of comforting. I would love it if we could recompile and cross check so many models against a different floating point standard. Those of you that don't distrust IEEE floating point, worry me. <br>

TBH, I have very little confidence that will ever happen. They have thrown a boatload of mostly untested concepts together, but unless you have Manhattan program style nearly unlimited resources available, that's not the way to bring innovation into the world. It has earned them a small but vocal internet following though, I grant them that.<br>
<p>
I think some of the concepts they present could be interesting topics for some academic research, but it seems them being super protective around it has caused academics to decide to not touch that stuff with a 10ft pole. Or then academics with much more architecture experience than me have looked at Mill and concluded it's uninteresting, IDK.<br>

<p>
That sounds quite interesting. Seems the main difference is that posits are less uniformly distributed than IEEE floats: they have better precision for numbers around +/- 1.0, and also a wider range (smaller minimum positive value, larger maximum finite value), with the tradeoff of worse precision for numbers closer to the extremes. They implement that by effectively having a variable-length exponent and mantissa, so numbers further from 1.0 will allocate more bits to range at the expense of precision.<br>
<p>
There may be many use cases where it's very useful to have more precision around +/- 1.0 - in particular there seems to be some interest among HPC people - but I'm not convinced it'd be a good idea for general-purpose computation where many people use floats nowadays. I'm thinking of stuff like 3D games, which are a significant driver of PC hardware performance, where the graphics and physics engines do a lot of work on coordinates that are within a reasonably limited range (the size of a game world which is small enough to walk around) and are rarely close to +/-1, and they need reasonably consistent precision across that range (because players get sad when they walk to the far corners of the world and everything goes wobbly), which is the exact opposite of what posits provide.<br>
<p>
Fixed-point integers provide even more consistent precision, but stuff like sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2) is relatively expensive and awkward to do without overflow in fixed-point, so people don't want to do that either. IEEE floats seem like a useful compromise - you can be sloppy and ignore both precision and overflow, and you can largely ignore scale (it doesn't matter if you define 1.0 as representing 1mm or 1km, you'll get similar precision either way, unlike posits or fixed-point), and if you're working at a normal human range (from mm up to km) then you'll probably get away with it.<br>
<p>
Posits sound like they're probably better than IEEE floats when you're interested in numerical analysis and you can scale your data and design your algorithms to work around +/-1, but possibly worse in the default case where people don't want to think about all that.<br>

<p>
Why is fixed point a problem? Yes it causes a bit more grief in that the programmer has to keep track of the decimal, but if I define 1 as mm to 0 decimal places, then I simply redefine the number to be 6dp and I've converted it to km.<br>
<p>
You can't just use fixed point without knowing what you're doing, but provided you know the typical range of the numbers you are dealing with, it can make life much simpler.<br>

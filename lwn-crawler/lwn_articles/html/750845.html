<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 9, 2018</br>
           </div>
The Linux network stack does not lack for features; it also performs well
enough for most uses.  At the highest network speeds, though, any overhead
at all is too much; that has driven the most demanding users toward
specialized, user-space networking implementations that can outperform the
kernel for highly constrained tasks.  The express data path (XDP)
development effort is an attempt to win those users back, with some apparent
success so far.  With the posting of the <a
href="/Articles/750293/"><tt>AF_XDP</tt> patch set</a> by Björn Töpel,
another piece of the XDP puzzle is coming into focus.
<p>
The core idea behind the XDP initiative is to get the network stack out of the
way as much as possible.  While the network stack is highly
flexible, XDP is built around a bare-bones packet transport that is as
fast as it can be.  When a decision needs to be made or a packet must be
modified, XDP will provide a hook for a user-supplied BPF program to do the
work.  The result combines minimal overhead with a great deal of
flexibility, at the cost of a little "some assembly required" label on the
relevant man pages.  For users who count every nanosecond of
packet-processing overhead (to the point that the 4.17 kernel will include
some painstaking enhancements to the BPF JIT compiler that reduces the size
of the generated code by 5%), figuring out how to put the pieces together
is worth the trouble.

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/682538/">earliest XDP work</a> enabled the loading
of a BPF program into the network interface device driver, with the initial
use case being a program that dropped packets as quickly as possible.
That may not be the most exciting application, but it is a useful feature
for a site that is concerned about fending off distributed
denial-of-service attacks. 
Since then, XDP has gained the ability to perform simple routing
(retransmitting a packet out the same interface it arrived on) and, for
some hardware, to offload the BPF program into the interface itself.
<p>
There are limits, though, to what can be done in the context of a
network-interface driver; for such cases,
<tt>AF_XDP</tt> is intended to connect the XDP path through to user space.
It can be thought of as being similar to the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html"><tt>AF_PACKET</tt></a>
address family, in that it transports packets to and from an
application with a minimum of processing, but this interface is clearly
intended for applications that prioritize packet-processing performance above
convenience.  So, once again, some
assembly is required in order to actually use it.
<p>
That assembly starts by calling <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html"><tt>socket()</tt></a>
in the usual way with the
<tt>AF_XDP</tt> address family; that yields a socket file descriptor that
can (eventually) be used to move packets.  First, however, it is
necessary to create an array in user-space memory called a "UMEM".  It is
a chunk of contiguous memory, divided into equal-sized "frames" (the actual
size is specified by the caller), each of
which can hold a single packet.  By itself, the UMEM looks rather boring:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/af_xdp1.png" alt="[The UMEM array]" class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
After the memory has been allocated by the application, this array is
registered with the socket using the <tt>XDP_UMEM_REG</tt> command of the
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockopt.2.html"><tt>setsockopt()</tt></a>
system call.
<p>
Each frame in the array has an integer index called a "descriptor".  To use
those descriptors, the application creates a circular buffer called the
"fill queue", using the <tt>XDP_UMEM_FILL_QUEUE</tt> <tt>setsockopt()</tt>
call.  This queue can then be mapped into user-space memory using
<tt>mmap()</tt>.  The application can request that the kernel place an
incoming
packet into a specific frame in the UMEM array by adding that frame's
descriptor to the fill queue:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/af_xdp2.png" alt="[The fill queue]" class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
Once a descriptor goes into the fill queue, the kernel owns it (and the
associated UMEM frame).  Getting
that descriptor back (with a new packet in the associated frame) requires
creating yet another queue (the "receive 
queue"), with the <tt>XDP_RX_QUEUE</tt> <tt>setsockopt()</tt> operation.
It, too, is a circular buffer that must be mapped into user space; once a frame
has been filled with a packet, its descriptor will be moved to the receive
queue.  A call to <tt>poll()</tt> can be used to wait for packets to arrive
in the receive queue.
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/af_xdp3.png" alt="[The receive queue]" class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
A similar story exists on the transmit side.  The application creates a
transmit queue with <tt>XDP_TX_QUEUE</tt> and maps it; a packet is
transmitted by placing its descriptor into that queue.  A call to
<tt>sendmsg()</tt> informs the kernel that one or more descriptors are
ready for transmission.  The completion
queue (created with <tt>XDP_UMEM_COMPLETION_QUEUE</tt>) receives
descriptors from the kernel after the packets they contain have been
transmitted.  The full picture looks something like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/af_xdp4.png" alt="[The transmit queue]" class="photo">
</blockquote>
<p>
This whole data structure is designed to enable zero-copy movement of
packet data between user space and the kernel, though the current patches
do not yet implement that.  It also allows received packets to be
retransmitted without copying them, since any descriptor can be used for
either transmission or reception.
<p>
The UMEM array can be shared between multiple processes.  If a process
wants to create an <tt>AF_XDP</tt> socket attached to an existing UMEM, it
simply passes its socket file descriptor and the file descriptor associated
with the socket owning the UMEM to <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html"><tt>bind()</tt></a>;
the second file descriptor is passed in the <tt>sockaddr_xdp</tt> structure.
There is only one fill queue and one 
completion queue associated with the UMEM regardless of how many
processes are using it, but each process must maintain its own transmit and
receive queues.  In other words, in a multi-process configuration, it is
expected that one process (or thread) will be dedicated to the management
of the UMEM frames, while each of the others takes on one aspect of the
packet-handling task.
<p>
There is one other little twist here, relating to how the kernel chooses a
receive queue for any given incoming packet.  There are two pieces to that
puzzle, the first of which is yet another new BPF map type called
<tt>BPF_MAP_TYPE_XSKMAP</tt>.  This map is a simple array, each entry of
which can contain a file descriptor corresponding to an <tt>AF_XDP</tt>
socket.  A process that is attached to the UMEM can call <tt>bpf()</tt> to
store its file descriptor in the map; what is actually stored is an
internal kernel pointer, of course, but applications won't see that.

The other piece is a BPF program loaded into the driver whose job
is to classify incoming packets and direct them to one of the entries in
the map; that will cause the packets to show up in the receive queue
corresponding to the <tt>AF_XDP</tt> socket in the chosen map entry.
<p>
Without the map and BPF program, an <tt>AF_XDP</tt> socket is unable to
receive packets.  You <i>were</i> warned that some assembly was required.
<p>
The final piece is a <tt>bind()</tt> call to attach the socket to a
specific network interface and, probably, a specific hardware queue within that
interface.  The interface itself can then be configured to direct packets
to that queue if they should be handled by the program behind the
<tt>AF_XDP</tt> socket.
<p>
The intended final result is a structure that can enable user-space code to
perform highly efficient packet management, with as much hardware support
as possible and with a minimum of overhead in the kernel.  There are some
other pieces that are needed to get there, though.  The zero-copy code is
clearly one of them; copying packet data between the kernel and user space
is fatal in any sort of high-performance scenario.  Another one is the <a
href="/Articles/750571/">XDP redirect patch set</a> being developed by
Jesper Dangaard Brouer; that functionality is what will allow an XDP
program to direct packets toward specific <tt>AF_XDP</tt> sockets.  Driver
support is also required; that is headed toward mainline for a couple of
Intel network interfaces now.
<p>
If it all works as planned, it should become possible to process packets at
a much higher rate than has been possible with the mainline network stack
so far.  This functionality is not something that many developers will feel
driven to use, but it is intended to be appealing to those who have
resorted to user-space stacks in the past.  It is a sign of an interesting
direction that kernel development has taken: new functionality is highly
flexible, but using it requires programming for the BPF virtual machine.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wonder (as someone who does not know enough about networking) whether this will be usable in combination of in-device processing (e.g. a card's hardware TCP/IP stack) as well in future.  I seem to recall that Linux preferred to do as much of that processing on the CPU as possible until recently, but I don't know whether that is changing or likely to change - I would expect that using specialised network processing hardware has at least the potential to be a performance benefit.  I am sure that the answers will enlighten me...<br>

Nice overview. I guess this is intended to appeal to users of DPDK and the like. <br>
<p>
“and, for some hardware, to offload the BPF program into the interface itself.”<br>
<p>
Does anyone have a link to which devices support this and any patches needed to enable this. Offloading arbitrary BPF programs to the NIC sounds very interesting given the path the kernel seems to be taking. <br>

      Much of the available information seems to be in the form of slidware, but Netronome has a card that does BPF offload.

And yes, from what I can see, only Netronome offer kernel support for HW offload of eBPF programs today (but I'd love to be corrected if this is not true).<br>

Will stuff like libonload eventually use this? Or are they to remain separate forever?<br>

Nice article.  I wrote up some notes on Magnus Karlsson's FOSDEM talk on AF_XDP here (scroll down to the second talk):<br>

<p>
I thought the following talk by François-Frédéric Ozog was an interesting counterpoint.  In any case, if the kernel can get packets to userspace in a fast, generic way, that would definitely be a step forward.<br>

Hi Jonathan,<br>
Thanks for this very interesting article. <br>
One question though: is AF_XDP still hindered by interrupts? I mean in high-performance applications the "ksoftirqd" thread will jump up to 100% of CPU usage in scenarios where you're receiving a lot of packets per second... on 100Gbps the theoretical max is 148 MPPS... unless you use DPDK framework, which does use polling instead of interrupts, you will never achieve that PPS rates on Linux. Is AF_XDP using a polling mechanism or relies on interrupts?<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>

irq load will be a function of how often NAPI posts from its loop, which can be controlled with sysctls.<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 22, 2024</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
The problem of sharing page tables across processes has been discussed
numerous times over the years, Khalid Aziz said at the beginning of his <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a> session on the topic.  He
was there to, once again, talk about the proposed <a
href="/Articles/895217/"><tt>mshare()</tt></a> system call (which, in its
current form, is no longer actually a system call but the feature still
goes by that name) and to see what can be done to finally get it into the
mainline.
<p>
Threads, he said, naturally share page tables, but independent processes do
not.  An individual page-table entry (PTE — mapping a single page) is
small, but a process's page tables contain many PTEs and can add up to a
significant amount of memory use.  The problem is exacerbated when many
processes share the same memory region; each of those processes will have
its own full set of page tables for that region.  He mentioned a case of a large,
well-provisioned database server that had 1,500 processes all sharing the
same memory area; the resulting page-table overhead was larger than the
size of the shared region and ran the system entirely out of memory.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/974514/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/lsfmm/KhalidAziz-sm.png" alt="[Khalid Aziz]"
title="Khalid Aziz" class="rthumb"></a>

To avoid this kind of problem (and to put that memory to better use), Aziz
would like to bring thread-like page-table sharing to processes; that is
the purpose of <tt>mshare()</tt>, which was
originally created by Matthew Wilcox.  It provides an opt-in mechanism by
which a process can inform the kernel that it wants to share the page
tables for a given region; the kernel then makes it possible for other
processes to map that region.  Since page tables are shared, page
protections are also shared, a fact that application developers need to
keep in mind.  Pasha Tatashin pointed out that, when page tables are shared, the
virtual address must also be shared — the region must be mapped at the same
address in all processes.
<p>
The first version of the <tt>mshare()</tt> patches was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1642526745.git.khalid.aziz@oracle.com/">posted</a>
in January 2022; it was then discussed at LSFMM+BPF that year, resulting in
some significant changes.  The system call was renamed to
<tt>ptshare()</tt> then, but Aziz would now like to move forward with
<tt>mshare()</tt>, which has been redesigned around the filesystem-based <a
href="/Articles/901059/">msharefs</a> concept rather than as a new system
call.
<p>
To use this feature, Aziz continued, the first step is to mount the
msharefs filesystem.  A process will then create a file on that filesystem
and map it as <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt>.  The fact that the file lives in this
special filesystem is the indication to the kernel that the creating
process wants to share the page tables for that region with others.  Those
others can open the file, and read this structure from it:
<p>
<pre>
    struct mshare_info {
    	unsigned long start;
	unsigned long size;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>start</tt> and <tt>size</tt> values can then be used by the new
process to map the region at the correct location.
<p>
The kernel maintains an <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.1/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L762"><tt>mm_struct</tt>
structure</a> for each process, describing its address space.  Use of
msharefs causes the creation of a separate <tt>mm_struct</tt>, independent
of any process, to describe the shared region.  The kernel, running in the
context of the creating process, will
end up copying the relevant virtual memory areas (VMAs) over to the new
<tt>mm_struct</tt>; its original VMAs will be marked with a special flag
pointing to the new <tt>mm_struct</tt>.
<p>
David Hildenbrand asserted that msharefs needed to identify the new VMAs as
a sort of special container that would prohibit use with features like <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>,
but others objected to that idea.  There is no reason, Wilcox said, that
these VMAs cannot be used with <tt>userfaultfd()</tt>, just like memory
shared between threads can be used there.
<p>
Michal Hocko asked how the shared memory, which has no owning process, is
accounted for in control groups; Aziz admitted that accounting was "a
little complication" that has not been fully solidified yet.  Hocko said
that it was important for the kernel to be able to find all of the
processes mapping the region and kill them in out-of-memory situations;
msharefs cannot be merged without this ability, he said.  He added that
basic memory accounting also matters; which process is charged when a new
page is allocated in response to a fault?  Shakeel Butt said that the
kernel has no good solution for the accounting of shared memory in general,
currently; memory is simply charged to the process that faults it in first.
<p>
Another complication, evidently, is that potential users of this feature
want the creating process to exit.  Hildenbrand, though, said that the page
tables should be torn down when the original process goes away.  That
process should also be the one that is charged for the shared memory
solving the control-group problem.  Wilcox worried, though, that keeping the
original process around would be an easy way to create unkillable
processes.
<p>
The final topic covered was locking; Jason Gunthorpe was concerned that it
would now be necessary to take two independent <tt>mmap_lock</tt> locks
(one in each <tt>mm_struct</tt>) to
make changes to the VMA tree.  Wilcox said that there is only a single
level of lock nesting, in a well-defined order, so there can be no cycles
(and thus no deadlock worries).  Hildenbrand said that most page-table
walkers should simply refuse to deal with the special <tt>mm_struct</tt>,
but Gunthorpe said that <tt>get_user_pages()</tt> needs to work, and that
opens a whole can of worms.  There are other use cases out there as well,
he said.  As the session ended, Hildenbrand suggested special-casing things
as much as possible, and not trying to do complex things around this
strange mechanism initially.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Did anyone propose using MMU notifiers to mirror page tables from one primary process into secondary processes without touching the VMAs or creating a new mm_struct?<br>
<p>
The kernel already sorta does that (mirroring userspace memory into other contexts at the page table level) for KVM and for some IOMMU stuff...<br>

<p>
Mount a filesystem? Create a file? What?<br>
<p>
Solaris solved this decades ago - it is called "Intimate Shared Memory"<br>
<p>
shmget - Get shared memory<br>
shmat - Attach shared memory with SHM_SHARE_MMU flag to share page tables.<br>
<p>
No need to involve any filesystem code at all or traverse the VFS layer / mount layer of the kernel!<br>
<p>
Linux already has shmget and shmat, it would be nice for it to catch up with where Solaris was in the mid 1990's by just adding a flag!<br>

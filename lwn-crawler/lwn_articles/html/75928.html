<h1>Lots of SCSI disks</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 16, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
One of the motivations for increasing the size of the <tt>dev_t</tt> device
number type in 2.6 was to allow the use of huge numbers of SCSI disks.  In
the 2.6.4 kernel, however, that promise remains unfulfilled; the SCSI
subsystem makes no use of the expanded device number range.  That will
change in 2.6.5, however; a patch has been merged which allows the
enumeration of up to 1&nbsp;million SCSI disks.
<p>
The authors of this patch had an interesting problem to solve: they wanted
to be able to enumerate all of those disks without breaking existing
systems.  In other words, all of the existing SCSI device numbers have to
work as they do in 2.4 and prior kernels.  The solution is expressed in the
following macro, which turns a device index (the "nth disk") and a
partition number into its associated device number:
<p>
<pre>
static unsigned int make_sd_dev(unsigned int sd_nr, unsigned int part)
{
	return  (part &amp; 0xf) | ((sd_nr &amp; 0xf) &lt;&lt; 4) |
		(sd_major((sd_nr &amp; 0xf0) &gt;&gt; 4) &lt;&lt; 20) | (sd_nr &amp; 0xfff00);
}
</pre>
<p>
LWN readers will, no doubt, immediately understand what is going on here.
Your editor, however, had to stare at it for a little while.  Then, as a
way of avoiding doing real work, he made the following diagram to show how
a device index and partition number are transmogrified into a device
number. 
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/scsi-numbers.png" width=545 height=232 
alt="[SCSI numbering diagram]" border=0>
</center>
<p>
The "remap" operation takes four bits from the device index  and uses them
to index into an array of the 16 major numbers which have been assigned for
some time to SCSI disks: 8, 65-71, and 128-135.  The lowest four bits of
the device index move directly down into the minor number.
The result is that the
first 256 SCSI disks will get exactly the same major and minor numbers that
they have
in 2.4 kernels.  
<p>
Once that space has been exhausted, however, the four red
bits in the diagram will return to zero, the major number will go back to
8, the highest-order bits in the device index are routed back into the
minor number, and, as a result, the 257th disk will be given device number
<tt>8:256</tt>.  The 
273rd disk will advance again to the next major number; it will be given
number <tt>65:256</tt>.  Additional disks will be distributed across the
available major numbers indefinitely until their combined power load flips
a breaker somewhere.
<p>
The result is a scheme which might be a little hard for humans to follow,
but, when you are dealing with thousands of disks, that will be the case
anyway.  Meanwhile, most of the main design goals - support lots of disks
without breaking existing systems - have been met.  There is one remaining
issue, however: some SCSI users have been asking for the ability to have
more than 15 partitions on one drive.  Supporting a larger partition space
and simultaneously preserving compatibility is not currently possible
because the block layer expects partitions to be assigned contiguous minor
numbers.  Fixing that will require tweaks to the gendisk code.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      --That is a Truly Neat Hack.  I don't understand it, but the explanation given in the article by the Editor is sufficient for me.<p>--AFA having more than 15 partitions on one disk - WHY??  It's generally better to just add disks; that way you're usually looking at less impact if one particular device fails.<p>--Can anybody come up with a good real-world reason to have &gt;15 partitions on one device?  I mean, my setup looks like this:<p>hda: (80GB)<br>1 - 1600MB Win98 C:<br>2 - 16MB /boot<br>3 - 8MB Knoppix/Syslinux bootfloppy image<br>4 - Extended --=&gt; rest of drive<br>5 - 256MB Swap<br>6 - 9GB D:<br>7 - 4480MB E: DVD/CD temp partition<br>8 - reserved (leftover from a resize)<br>9 - 4800MB (?Mepis install?)<br>10 - 4GB LVM<br>11 - ~53GB Backups (Reiserfs)<p>hdb: (80GB)<br>1 - 5GB Knoppix hdinstall<br>2 - 3GB LVM<br>3 - 8MB alternate /boot<br>4 - Extended<br>5 - 500MB Swap<br>6 - 5GB DVD/CD temp space #2 (ext2)<br>7 - 10GB F: -- ISO storage, games, etc<br>8 - 4GB ??? (Man I wish I wasn't writing this from Windoze)<br>9 - 5GB ??? (Space for testing another Linux install, prolly)<br>10 - 4GB (Reserved for future expansion)<br>11 - ~38GB Backups #2 (Reiserfs)<p>--I think the largest number of partitions I've ever had on 1 device went up to 13, but that was before restructuring.  If anyone can come up with a valid and -necessary- scheme for having 16 or more partitions, I'd really like to see it.<p>--OTOH, *BSD has a partition scheme that uses &quot;slices&quot; - which are basically sub-partitions.  I dunno exactly how well the Linux kernel currently supports UFS(? might be FFS) filesystem writing or formatting, but might be something to consider.<br>

<p>
It's needed if you want many OSes on the same machine for testing and cannot stand more noise from additional drives.  Don't forget that BSD subpartitions (disklabel) also count in Linux as partitions.  Imagine installing Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD on the same machine in the default configuration, i.e. with separate swap and /usr partitions.  That will put you very close to the limit.

      &gt; Can anybody come up with a good real-world   <br>&gt; reason to have &gt;15 partitions on one device?   <br>   <br>I recently ran into that question here, on my (luckily IDE, as IDE allows   <br>64 partitions) 250G drive, as I considered installing Gentoo dual-boot on   <br>my current Mandrake system.  I do have a second, older, disk, but it   <br>contains a backup installation useful for when my main drive won't boot   <br>because I hosed something up, and for critical personal data backup.  I   <br>don't want to change that, at least until/unless Gentoo becomes my primary   <br>distrib so I don't have the possibility of having the regular Mandrake   <br>system hosed by updates, while Gentoo may also not yet be operational or   <br>is itself hosed.   <br>   <br>Now, this wouldn't apply to corporate installations, and SCSI tends to be   <br>used more in that environment than in the home, since IDE is cheaper if   <br>more limited and slower, but yes, there ARE reasons to have more than 16   <br>partitions, for some of us.   <br>   <br>FWIW,  here's my layout and why I needed more than 16 partitons (hmm, <br>looks better tabulated, but don't want to bother with the html).   <br>   <br>hda##   mntpt           comment   <br>01      /boot   <br>02      /   <br>03      /mnt/rtm        rootmirror, always keep a / backup   <br>04      --              extended partition mapping   <br>05      swap   <br>06      /usr   <br>07      /var   <br>08      /tmp   <br>09      /opt   <br>10      /usr/local   <br>11      /home   <br>12      /mnt/news       dedicated usenet cache   <br>13      /mnt/mail       dedicated mail partition   <br>14      /mnt/mm         dedicated multimedia   <br>   <br>Those are my Mandrake partitions.  As I got set to install Gentoo, I   <br>remembered reading about a 16 partition limit, and had to go look it up   <br>and find (to my great relief) that IDE had a larger 64 partition limit.    <br>Here's how I set that up (as listed in my mandrake fstab: boot, tmp, mail,   <br>news, opt, swap, mm, and home, are to be shared)   <br>   <br>15      /mnt/g          g=gentoo, thus, the gentoo root   <br>16      /mnt/g/mnt/rtm  root-mirror for gentoo   <br>17      /mnt/g/usr      gentoo's /usr   <br>18      /mnt/g/var   <br>19      /mnt/g/usr/local   <br>   <br>That still doesn't include dedicated /var/log partitions, one for each   <br>distrib, likely shared public www, p2p, and ftp partitions, if I were so   <br>inclined, or any MSWormOS partitions, since I am MS free (the only   <br>proprietary-ware I believe I still have is my original Master of Orion   <br>game, which I continue to play on occasion using a DOSBox VM).  In   <br>addition, further distribs or other OSs, the BSDs, for instance, if I were   <br>to install any of them, would take up further multiple partitions.   <br>   <br>BTW, on that 250G drive, with the above 19 partitions (well, 18, since   <br>hda4 is virtual), I still have over 100G of unpartitioned free space to   <br>eventually expand into, so I'm definitely glad, with that sort of space   <br>around, that IDE does more than 16 partitions.  &lt;g&gt;   <br>   <br>Duncan

I've also had 20 or more on a single system; some of the reasons:

<UL TYPE="disc">
  <LI>I like to have system dirs mounted read-only where possible; it's hard to mount / as "read-only except for var and etc and tmp".
  <LI>I like to download directly into a CD-sized partition for ~ quick burning of archives without moving a lot of files around (and I like to have at least two or three such partitions since I don't always get the sorting/burning done right away, nor the cleaning-out part after the burn).
  <LI>In the old days, Linux didn't handle swap partitions bigger than 128 MB.  I usually had three or four.
  <LI>OS/2 partitions (including boot mangler), DOS partitions, etc...
</UL>

<P>
These days I still do the read-only and CD-R things, but I'm trying to trim things where possible.  My backup disks are single-partition monsters (read-only, of course, and spun down 99% of the time).

      --I see your point...  However, I suppose my &quot;need&quot; for more partitions has been largely bypassed due to using Vmware Workstation.  (Note - I have no affiliation, blahblahblah; just a satisfied customer.)<p>--For testing purposes, or even virtual servers, Vmware is really well done - separate &quot;disks&quot; are merely files on an existing partition, which makes backups really easy.  (Although you can in fact give the virtual machine access to the real disk hardware; I was using this method to access my Win98 files in-situ from a VM for a while.)<p>--By using Vmware, I was able (for instance) to beta-test the Knoppix DVD without allocating any additional disk space (even though I didn't have a DVD burner at the time) simply by booting the VM directly from the ISO file; vmware can treat an ISO as a CDROM drive.<p>--If you have a need/want for constantly testing new distros (Linux, *BSD, etc - I've become something of a live-cd addict) without the repartitioning involved, I would seriously consider trying Vmware.  It's ~$300 for the 1st purchase, but only $99 for upgrades -- and they have a 30-day free trial IIRC.  It's come in quite handy over the years - I'm still on version 3.x, and I believe the current rev is 4.x now.  (I might have to upgrade eventually though; my 3.x is having trouble with Linux kernel 2.6.x.)<p>(Side note - I've run VM's with only 128MB of RAM installed, on a Pentium 233; but it runs better with higher specs.  On my AMD Duron 900 with 512MB, you can hardly tell the difference between a VM and the native OS.  YMMV.  About the only thing vmware is NOT good at, are 3D-intense apps - such as FPS games - and 3.x has a few problems with sound.  I think they fixed the sound issue in 4.x tho.)<p>( http://www.vmware.com ) ( http://www.vmware.com/products/desktop/ws_features.html )<br>

      Surely running lvm (or device mapper -- dm) over the top of the disks makes sense in this environment? One can then create as many parititions as one wants using the LVM equivalents and hence the problem goes away.<p>Stu.<br>

      Frankly, I've never understood why partitions are implemented down in the block device layer at all.  If it were up to me, I'd use an LVM-style setup for ALL partitions -- i.e. a partition device driver stacked on top of a physical device driver, with the latter being blissfully ignorant of partitions.

<p>Then there's no need for partition bits in a SCSI disk minor number.  And people with thousands of disks (which of course are not partitioned) wouldn't have to worry about partitions at all.

      Block drivers <i>are</i> blissfully ignorant of partitions - in 2.6.  Occasionally somebody brings up the idea of moving partition handling out entirely, all the way to user space.  That probably will not happen, though; things like booting from an arbitrary partition get increasingly hard when you do that.

      They're not <i>totally</i> ignorant, or it wouldn't have come up here.  The SCSI disk driver (sd) has to be aware enough of the existence of partitions to allocate exactly 16 minor numbers for each physical device.  If partitions were instead handled by a separate device driver with a separate major number, LVM style, we wouldn't be worrying about how many bits to reserve for partitions.
<p>
I can't imagine how partitions could be moved all the way out to user space and maintain any significant part of their value.

      Millions of scsi disks? Stop the insanity!! :)<p>Have the kernel developers ever watched a system boot with just 100 Luns? It's not pretty. Hopefully, any work to increase the number of available luns will also have done some abstraction on the boot sequence list, i.e.<br>1 of 230 LUNs found<br>2 of 230 LUNs found<p>etc.

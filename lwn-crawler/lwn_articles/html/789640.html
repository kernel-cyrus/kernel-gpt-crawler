<p>
In a followup to his <a href="/Articles/787614/">earlier session on dying
control groups</a>, Roman Gushchin wanted to talk about problems with the
shrinkers and filesystem caches in a combined filesystem and
memory-management session at the 
2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit (LSFMM).
Specifically, for control groups that share the same underlying filesystem,
the shrinkers are not able to reclaim memory from the VFS caches after a
control group dies, at least under slight to moderate memory pressure.  He
wanted to discuss how to reclaim that memory without major performance
impacts. 
</p>

<p>
The starting point might be to determine how to calculate the memory
pressure to apply, he said.  Back in October and November, there were several
proposals on 
doing that; his <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=172b06c32b949759fe6313abec514bc4f15014f4">patch</a>
was reverted due to performance regressions, but there were others, none of 
which went upstream.

<p>
Chris Mason asked if there was a need to reparent the caches.  Gushchin
said that was already being done, but that there is no way to move pages
between different caches, so references to shared objects persist.
Christoph Lameter suggested making slab objects movable, so that things
like directory entry (dentry) cache entries and inodes could be moved, but
Gushchin 
said that the objects are in use, so they cannot be moved.  Lameter said
that it would take some work, but those objects could be made movable.
</p>

<p>
James Bottomley said that he didn't think this was a shrinker problem,
exactly.  The objects are still in use based on the reference counts so
they should not be reclaimed.  Gushchin said that the current shrinker
implementation tries to minimize the number of objects it has to scan, so
unless there is major memory pressure, it doesn't scan anything.  Small
objects held by a dying control group could be holding onto a large amount
of memory, but when calculating the pressure, the system does not know if
that is the case.
</p>

<p>
Bottomley said that the idea behind the shrinkers is to reclaim just
the amount of memory needed, not to reclaim it all.  So if you think you
have 100MB of reclaimable memory, but only need ten pages, that's all the
shrinkers are meant to give you.  Changing that will cause regressions in
lots of other places.
</p>

<p>
What was proposed, Gushchin said, was to provide additional pressure so
that some amount of scanning is done.  Right now, the shrinkers don't scan
anything, 
then the system runs out of memory, so all of the reclaimable memory gets
freed.  Bottomley said that perhaps the solution is not in the shrinkers,
but in handling the dying control groups differently.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that the kernel cannot shrink hard enough without impacting
performance, Mason said.  It is the same problem that was discussed in the
earlier session; there needs to be a way to move or copy the objects
elsewhere so the dying control group no longer owns the memory.  Gushchin
said that he didn't know if trying to move pages between caches is "totally
crazy" or not.  After a long pause, Mason said "I think it should be easy"
to laughter.
</p>

<p>
An attendee asked if control groups really need to use different pages or
if their 
pages could be merged by the allocator.  Gushchin said that control groups
are charged for memory on a per-page basis; each page belongs to a
particular control group.  Bottomley summarized the problem by saying that
if three objects are allocated normally, they all likely end up in the same
page, but if they are allocated by three different control groups, they
each end up in their own page.  Another attendee noted that once a control
group goes away, the page with that object will not be filled further and
may not be reclaimed for some time.
</p>

<p>
That led Bottomley to wonder if the page's ownership could be switched to a
different control group; that way the memory references to the object would
not have to change.  Matthew Wilcox rephrased that as donating the slab page to
another similar slab in the system that is associated with a still-running
control group.  Ted Ts'o said there is a policy question with that
approach, as suddenly a control group gets charged with a new page.  But
Wilcox stressed the word "donate"; the new control group would not be taxed
for the new page. "No taxation without allocation", he said, to groans and
chuckles. 
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of switching to a per-byte charging model for
control groups, but the complexity seemed high.  Bottomley said that any
attempt to change the charging policy would be reopening a "big can of
worms".   After that, Mason asked Gushchin if the discussion had made
things easier or harder.  Gushchin said that it was "hard to say", there
are several different kinds of objects that come into play.
</p>

<p>
Mason said that the most complicated thing to move would be the inodes
because there are lots of pointers from pages back to the inode.  There may
well be other slabs that are far worse that he doesn't know about,
however.  Lameter said that making these objects movable would solve a lot
of problems and not just for this particular situation.  Making objects
that are frequently allocated, such as dentries and inodes, movable would
be an overall improvement to the kernel.  It would, for example, make it
easier to assemble huge pages when needed.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o asked if anyone had looked to see which slab objects are the most
problematic.  His guess would be the inodes, which is also the hardest to
deal with.  But, if so, it might also give the "most bang for the buck".
Gushchin said it is mostly dentries and inodes.  Mason said that inodes
require the most I/O to get them back so it would be worth preserving them
if possible.
</p>

<p>
If the pages were donated to some common cache, the next allocation of that
size that required a new page could return the partly filled page, an
attendee said.  It
would be more efficient than donating it to another control group when it
is not known that the group will actually need to do more allocation.
Wilcox called that a kind of "lazy donation".  Ts'o added that donating a
page that contained, say, an inode owned by a dying control group would at
least allow the rest of the page to be used by someone, rather than just
wasting most of a page. 
</p>

<p>
The problem with donating cache pages is that there is no way to get from a
control group to the list of slab pages that it has objects in, Mason
said.  From a complexity point of view, it needs to be determined if it is
worth tracking that and keeping it up to date.  At that point, the
discussion trailed off without any real resolution other than some possible
paths forward.

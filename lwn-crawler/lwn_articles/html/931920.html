           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 18, 2023</br>
           <hr>

Joel Fernandes introduced himself to the memory-management track at the
2023 <a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a> as a co-maintainer of the
read-copy-update (RCU) subsystem and an implementer of the "lazy RCU"
functionality.  Lazy RCU can improve performance, especially on systems
that are not heavily utilized, but it also has some implications for memory
management that he wanted to discuss with the group.
<p>
The core idea behind lazy RCU is that, when the system is idle, it may not
need to invoke RCU callbacks right away.  These callbacks trickle in
constantly, even on a lightly loaded system, and waking a CPU to call them
can disturb an otherwise idle system, confusing the power-management
code.  This behavior can be seen in workloads like video playback on Chrome
OS systems and Android logging.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/931922/"><img

title="Joel Fernandes" class="rthumb"></a>

RCU, he said, maintains a per-CPU "bypass list" to reduce contention.
Normally, callbacks can be queued on one CPU but run on another, which can
lead to lock contention and reduced performance.  If the main callback list
gets too long, the RCU code will start shunting callbacks over to the bypass
list instead, avoiding the need to acquire a lock.  Eventually the bypass
list is flushed back onto the main list, either as the result of a timer
firing or the bypass list getting too long.  Lazy RCU is based on the idea
that callbacks marked as non-urgent can go straight to the bypass list and
be processed at some future time.  This technique, he said, can reduce a
system's power usage by 10-20%.
<p>
One of the main uses of RCU callbacks is to release memory once it's safe
to do so.  Accumulating callbacks indefinitely thus has the potential to
run the system short of memory over time.  To avoid this problem, RCU
implements a simple shrinker that flushes bypass-list callbacks into the main
list, where they will be processed.  There are some problems with this
approach, though, starting with the fact that RCU has no way to know how
much memory any given callback will release to the system.  Shrinkers are
for caches, but the callback list is not really a cache; it is, instead, a
deferred garbage-collection mechanism.  So a call to the shrinker might
free more memory than is needed, but it doesn't do that immediately;
instead, the shrinker has to trigger an RCU grace period, which can take
some time.
<p>
Fernandes was looking for input on how the handling of this list could be
improved from a memory-management point of view.  Michal Hocko said that
the shrinker is probably not the right approach; the kernel's
proactive-reclaim mechanisms can cause shrinkers to be called even when the
system is not short of memory.  That could cause callbacks to be flushed
unnecessarily, defeating the purpose of lazy RCU.  A better idea would be
to hook into the allocator directly, perhaps in a function like <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc1/source/mm/page_alloc.c#L4125"><tt>should_reclaim_retry()</tt></a>.
When that call does happen, he said, RCU should just flush everything.
Fernandes said this approach might help.
<p>
Another attendee suggested that, since callbacks are being flushed in the
hope that they will free memory, the right thing to do would be to
specially mark callbacks that will do so?  Matthew Wilcox said that "99% of
RCU callbacks" free memory, but Fernandes disagreed, saying that they
handle numerous other types of tasks as well.  Still, he allowed that
"most" callbacks do, indeed, free memory.  Perhaps, he said, a better
approach would be to create an API for callbacks that <i>don't</i> return
memory to the system.
<p>
Fernandes asked whether it might make sense to get information from the
memory-management subsystem on whether any given callback actually freed
memory.  That might help in cases where a specific amount of memory is
targeted for freeing.  He also wondered if the RCU shrinker should return
zero (indicating no memory was actually freed), since it will have only
started a grace period and will not have actually freed any memory yet.  The
answer was that RCU should just drop the shrinker and implement something
better.
<p>
There was a side discussion about <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4-rc1/source/include/linux/rcupdate.h#L958"><tt>kfree_rcu()</tt></a>,
which exists for the sole purpose of freeing memory after an RCU grace
period.  This implementation, rather than maintaining a linked list of
callbacks, just fills a page with pointers to the objects to be freed; the
whole set can then be returned with a call to <tt>kfree_bulk()</tt>.  This
approach has a number of advantages, including increased cache locality and
the ability to use the more efficient <tt>kfree_bulk()</tt> method.  There
is a significant disadvantage, though, in that <tt>kfree_rcu()</tt> may
have to allocate memory while freeing.  Having to allocate memory in this
situation is something kernel developers go out of their way to avoid,
since that allocation might be impossible at exactly the time when it is
most needed.
<p>
Fernandes would like to build a deferred-freeing mechanism directly into
the slab allocator but, he confessed, he was "living in a fantasy world"
when he was researching the idea.  It is harder to do than he thought it
would be.  The interaction of grace periods with the slab allocator is
tricky and, when the need to free memory arises, the grace period might
have already passed, meaning that the RCU stage can be skipped entirely.
<p>
His thought was to mark objects specifically in the slab allocators as not
being ready to be freed quite yet.  The allocators could maintain such
objects in their free list, but not hand them out to new users until that
marking goes away.  That would eliminate the need to allocate memory in
<tt>kfree_rcu()</tt>, and could eliminate the need for a separate shrinker
as well.  Unfortunately, the SLUB allocator maintains its free lists by
storing pointers in the objects themselves — which is not advisable if the
objects are still in use.  Slab maintainer Vlastimil Babka said that he
would think about the problem.
<p>
Fernandes closed the session by saying that the benefits of this scheme may
not justify the addition of more complexity to the slab allocator.  For
now, at least, hooking into the reclaim path as Hocko suggested is the
direction this work seems likely to go.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

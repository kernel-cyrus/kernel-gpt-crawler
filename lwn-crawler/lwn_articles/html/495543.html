           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 2, 2012</br>
           </div>
Memory management is a notoriously tricky task, though the underlying
objective is quite clear: look into the future and ensure that the pages
that will be needed by applications are in memory.  Unfortunately, existing
crystal ball peripherals tend not to work very well; they also usually
require proprietary drivers.  So the kernel is stuck with a set of
heuristics that try to guess future needs based on recent behavior.
Adjusting those heuristics is always a bit of a challenge; it is easy to
put in changes that will break obscure workloads years in the future.  But
that doesn't stop developers from trying.
<p>
A core part of the kernel's memory management subsystem is a pair of lists
called the "active" and "inactive" lists.  The active list contains
anonymous and file-backed pages that are thought (by the kernel) to be in
active use by 
some process on the system.  The inactive list, instead, contains pages
that the kernel thinks might not be in use.  When active pages are
considered for eviction,
they are first moved to the inactive list and unmapped from the address
space of the process(es) using them.  Thus, once a page moves to the inactive
list, any attempt to reference it will generate a page fault; this "soft
fault" will cause the page to be moved back to the active list.  Pages that
sit in the inactive list for long enough are eventually removed from the
list and evicted from memory entirely.
<p>
One could think of the inactive list as a sort of probational status for
pages that kernel isn't sure are worth keeping.  Pages can get there from
the active list as described above, but there's another way to inactive
status as well: file-backed pages, when they are faulted in, are placed in the
inactive list.  It is quite common that a process will only access a
file's contents once; requiring a second access before moving file-backed
pages to the active list lets the kernel get rid of single-use data
relatively quickly.
<p>
Splitting memory into two pools in this manner leads to an immediate policy
decision: how big should each list be?  A very large inactive list gives
pages a long time to be referenced before being evicted; that can reduce
the number of pages kicked out of memory only to be read back in shortly
thereafter.  But a large inactive list comes at the cost of a smaller active
list; that can slow down the system as a whole by causing lots of soft page
faults for data that's already in memory.  So, as is the case with many
memory management decisions, regulating the relative sizes of the two lists
is a balancing act.
<p>
The way that balancing is done in current kernels is relatively
straightforward: the 
active list is not allowed to grow larger than the inactive list.  Johannes
Weiner has concluded that this heuristic is too simple and insufficiently
adaptive, so he has come up with <a href="/Articles/495423/">a proposal for
a replacement</a>.  In short, Johannes wants to make the system more
flexible by tracking how long evicted pages stay out of memory before
being faulted back in.
<p>
Doing so requires some significant changes to the kernel's page-tracking
infrastructure.  Currently, when a page is removed from the inactive list
and evicted from memory, the kernel 
simply forgets about it; that clearly will not do if the kernel is to try
to track how long the page remains out of memory.  The
page cache is tracked via a <a href="/Articles/175432/">radix tree</a>; the
kernel's radix tree implementation already has a concept of "exceptional
entries" that is used to track tmpfs pages while they are swapped out.
Johannes's patch extends this mechanism to store "shadow" entries for evicted
pages, providing the needed long-term record-keeping for those pages.
<p>
What goes into those shadow entries is a representation of the time the page was
swapped out.  That time can be thought of as a counter of removals from the
inactive list; it is represented as an <tt>atomic_t</tt> variable called
<tt>workingset_time</tt>.  Every time a page is removed from the inactive
list, either to evict it or to activate it, <tt>workingset_time</tt> is
incremented by one.  When a page is evicted, the current value of
<tt>workingset_time</tt> is stored in its associated shadow entry.  This
time, thus, can be thought of as a sort of sequence counter for memory
management events.
<p>
If and when that page is faulted back in, the difference between the
current <tt>workingset_time</tt> and the value in the shadow entry gives a
count of how many pages were removed from the inactive list while that page
was out of memory.  In the language of Johannes's patch, this difference is
called the "refault distance."  The observation at the core of this patch
set is that, if a page returns to memory with a refault distance of
<i>R</i>, its eviction and refaulting would have been avoided had the
inactive list been <i>R</i> pages longer.  <i>R</i>&nbsp;is thus a sort of
metric describing how much longer the inactive list should be made to avoid
a particular page fault.
<p>
Given that number, one has to decide how it should be used.  The algorithm
used in Johannes's patch is simple: if <i>R</i> is less than the length of
the active list, one page will be moved from the active to the inactive
list.  That shortens the active list by one entry and places the
formerly-active page on the inactive list immediately next to the page that
was just refaulted in (which, as described above, goes onto the inactive
list until a second access occurs).  If the formerly-active page is still
needed, it 
will be reactivated in short order.  If, instead, the working set is
shifting toward a new set of pages, the refaulted page may be activated
instead, taking the other page's place.  Either way, it is hoped, the
kernel will do a better job of keeping the right pages active.  Meanwhile,
the inactive list gets slightly longer in the hope of avoiding refaults in
the near future.
<p>
How well all of this works is not yet clear: Johannes has not posted any
benchmark results for any sort of workload.  This is early-stage work at
this point, a long way from acceptance into a mainline kernel release.  So
it could evolve significantly or fade away entirely.  But more
sophisticated balancing between the active and inactive lists seems like an
idea whose time may be coming.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks for the clear introduction to the LRU implementation.<br>
<p>
I'm not a kernel hacker, but still curious enough to look under the hood of my machine sometimes (especially in those moments when I'm convinced that a reasonable software cannot be so slow to complete the task in question...)<br>
<p>
To look into memory management there is /proc/kpageflags, displayed in human readable format by the page-types tool (recently moved from Documentation/vm to tools in the kernel tree).<br>
<p>
If I guess correctly the size of the active list can be shown using<br>
"page-types -b active"<br>
<p>
I further guess the size of the inactive list can be shown using<br>
"page-types -b lru,~active,~unevictable"<br>
<p>
(the article simplified from the fact that there are really 3 list nowadays, unevictable being the 3rd one. It's well described under Documentation/vm/unevictable-lru.txt)<br>
<p>
However, when running these commands on 2 machines in this moment I get:<br>
<p>
- active 168 MB, inactive 259 MB on a 512 MB system <br>
- active 1366 MB, inactive 971 MB on a 4 GB system<br>
<p>
So either my guesses about the options to use are incorrect or there is no such limitation as inactive &gt; active.<br>
<p>
All hints welcome!<br>

You can get the list sizes more easily:<br>
<p>
nassau:~$ grep active /proc/vmstat <br>
nr_inactive_anon 267<br>
nr_active_anon 392461<br>
nr_inactive_file 258286<br>
nr_active_file 416048<br>
<p>
Or even more detailed from /proc/zoneinfo, as each memory zone has its own set of lists.<br>
<p>
The inactive &gt; active rule is only enforced during reclaim, we don't mind the list sizes on idle systems.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
That's not actually the tradeoff.  The tradeoff is primarily about reducing the number of page reads from disk, without regard to the cost of soft page faults.
<p>
The tradeoff is the weight the policy gives to frequency of access vs the weight it gives to recency of access in forecasting when a page will next be accessed.
<p>
Let's say you have two pages.  Alpha was accessed once a minute ago and never since.  Beta was last accessed two minutes ago, but also 3, 4, and 5 minutes ago.  Which page is least likely to be referenced again in the next 5 minutes?
<p>
A large active / small inactive apportionment is more likely to say Alpha.  A small active / large inactive would more likely say Beta.
<p>
To make the proper list size choice, you have to employ a model of typical process page usage patterns, which you probably just do implicitly by observing how changing the sizes affects paging rates.  The proposed modification is supposed to be better because it effectively develops that model of access patterns automatically on the fly, and with finer grain.

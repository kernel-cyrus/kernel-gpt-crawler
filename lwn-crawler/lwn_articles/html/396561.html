<h1>Fixing writeback from direct reclaim</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 20, 2010</br>
           </div>
"Writeback" is the process of writing the contents of dirty memory pages
back to their backing store, where that backing store is normally a file or
swap area.  Proper handling of writeback is crucial for both system
performance and data integrity.  If writeback falls too far behind the
dirtying of pages, it could leave the system with severe memory pressure
problems.  Having lots of dirty data in memory also increases the amount of
data which may be lost in the event of a system crash.  Overly enthusiastic
writeback, on the other hand, can lead to excessive I/O bandwidth usage,
and poorly-planned writeback can greatly reduce I/O performance with
excessive disk seeks.  Like many memory-management tasks, getting writeback
right is a tricky exercise involving compromises and heuristics.

<p>
Back in April, LWN <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/384093/">looked at a
specific writeback problem</a>: quite a bit of writeback activity was
happening in direct reclaim.  Normally, memory pages are reclaimed (made
available for new uses, with data written back, if necessary) in the
background; when all goes well, there will always be a list of free pages
available when memory is needed.  If, however, a memory allocation request
cannot be satisfied 
from the free list, the kernel may try to reclaim pages directly in the
context of the process performing the allocation.  Diverting an allocation
request into this kind of cleanup activity is called "direct reclaim."
<p>
Direct reclaim normally
works, and it is a good way to throttle memory-hungry processes, but it
also suffers from a couple of significant problems.  One of those is stack
overflows; direct reclaim can happen from almost anywhere in the kernel, so
it may be that the kernel stack is already mostly used before the reclaim process even
starts.  But if reclaim involves writing file pages back, it can be just
the beginning of a long call chain in its own right, leading to the
overflow of the kernel stack.  Beyond that, direct reclaim, which reclaims
pages wherever it can find them, tends to create
seek-intensive I/O, hurting the whole system's I/O performance.
<p>
Both of these problems have been seen on production systems.  In response,
a number of filesystems have been changed so that they simply ignore
writeback requests which come from the direct reclaim code.  That makes the
problem go away, but it is a kind of papering-over that pleases nobody; it
also arguably increases the risk that the system could go into the dreaded
out-of-memory state.

<p>
Mel Gorman has been working on the reclaim problem, on and off, for a few
months now.  His <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/396512/">latest patch
set</a> will, with luck, improve the situation.  The actual changes made
are relatively small, but they apparently tweak things in the right
direction.
<p>
The key to solving a problem is understanding it.  So, perhaps, it's not
surprising that the bulk of the changes do not actually affect writeback;
they are, instead, tracing instrumentation and tools which provide
information on what the reclaim code is actually doing.  The new
tracepoints provide visibility into the nature of the problem and,
importantly, how much each specific change helps.
<p>
The core change is deep within the direct reclaim loop.  If direct reclaim
stumbles across a page which is dirty, it now must think a bit harder about
what to do with it.  If the dirty page is an anonymous (process data) page,
writeback happens as before.  The reasoning here seems to be that the
writeback path for these pages (which will be going to a swap area) will be
simpler than it is for file-backed pages; there are also fewer
opportunities for anonymous pages to be written back via other paths.  As a
result, anonymous writeback might still create seek problems - but only if
the swap area shares a spindle with other, high-bandwidth data.
<p>
For dirty, file-backed pages, the situation is a little different; direct
reclaim will no longer try to write back those pages directly.  Instead, it
creates a list of the dirty pages it encounters, then hands them over to
the appropriate background process for the real writeback work.  In some
cases (such as when <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/211505/">lumpy
reclaim</a> is trying to free specific larger chunks of memory), the direct
reclaim code will wait in the hope that the identified pages will soon
become free.  The rest of the time, it simply moves on, trying to find free
pages elsewhere.
<p>
Handing the reclaim work over to the threads which exist for that task has
a couple of benefits.  It is, in effect, a simple way of switching to
another kernel stack - one which is known to be mostly empty - before
heading into the writeback paths.  Switching stacks directly in the direct
reclaim code had been discussed, but it was decided that the mechanism the
kernel already has for switching stacks (context switches) was probably the
right thing to use in this situation.  Keeping the writeback work in kswapd
and the per-BDI writeback threads should also help performance, since those
threads try to order operations to minimize head seeks.
<p>
When this problem was discussed in April, Andrew Morton pointed out that,
over time, the amount of memory written back in direct reclaim has grown
significantly, with an adverse effect on system performance.  He wanted to
see thought put into why that change has happened rather than trying to
mitigate its effects.  The final patch in Mel's series looks like an
attempt to address this concern.  It changes the direct reclaim code so
that, if that code starts encountering dirty pages, it pokes the writeback
threads and tells them to start cleaning pages more aggressively.  The idea
here is to keep the normal reclaim mechanisms running at a fast-enough pace
that direct reclaim is not needed so often.  

<p>
This
tweak seems to have a significant effect on some benchmarks; Mel says:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Apparently, background flush must have been doing a better job
	getting [pages] cleaned in time and the direct reclaim stalls are
	harmful overall. Waking background threads for dirty pages made a
	very large difference to the number of pages written back. With all
	patches applied, just 759 filesystem pages were written back in
	comparison to 581811 in the vanilla kernel and overall the number
	of pages scanned was reduced.
</div>
<p>
Anybody who likes digging through benchmark results is advised to look at
Mel's patch posting - he appears to have run just about every test that he
could to quantify the effects of this patch series.  This kind of extensive
benchmarking makes sense for deep memory management changes, since even
small changes can have surprising results on specific workloads.  At this
point, it seems that the changes have the desired effect and most of the
concerns expressed with previous versions have been addressed.  The
writeback changes, perhaps, are getting ready for production use.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I really hope that they've finally got all this ironed out.<br>
<p>
Linux's problems with dirty memory pages have made it awful to use since forever. My old 1 GB Athlon64 laptop (now deceased) would often end up in minutes-long read/swap/flush storms when loading applications (laptop disk did not help here!). I had to use hacks to mlock X.org, critical libraries and Gnome daemons in order to maintain any kind of interactive response.<br>
<p>
Try running Evolution and Eclipse in 1 GB RAM in 64-bit mode and using the 2.6.24 kernel if you don't believe me. :)<br>
<p>
On that machine Windows XP64 used to run Eclipse so much nicer than 2.6.24.<br>

Is there a user tunable setting to control how many pages are kept in the free list at all times?  Specifically I'm wondering If I can make Linux a little more aggressive at flushing old data in the page cache to avoid hitting direct reclaim when my process does a large allocation. <br>

But remember that the "free list" is not the list of pages available for use.  It's much more complicated than that, and in fact nearly all the pages are available for use because of page stealing.
<p>
Some pages are more expensive to steal than others, and that's what makes the problem so hard.  But a clean page with evidence that it isn't going to be accessed soon is about as cheap to use to satisfy an allocation as a member of the free list.
<p>
The free list is a list of pages that don't contain data the kernel has any way of using in the future, and a large free list represents memory waste.

True, it's all a bit more complicated. Perhaps he should tune things like<br>
dirty_ratio and other dirty_* settings instead.<br>
<p>
But a large free list is useful to handle sudden memory pressure situations<br>
well without destroying latency. So if you have a spiky load having a bigger<br>
free list seems like a good idea to me. If you make sudden huge allocations<br>
then a bigger free list won't help much, what you want then is little dirty<br>

I don't know that there is any noticeable difference in the time it takes to get a page from the free list and the time it takes to steal a clean inactive page not in the free list.  But maybe, since it does take a certain number of CPU cycles to forget what used to be in the page.
<p>
I believe the only point of a minimum free list size is to provide some reserve for use in contexts where stealing is not possible.  In particular, when the page stealer itself needs memory in order to progress, it can't wait for a page steal to get it.  I.e. the parameter in question is for adjusting the probability of deadlock and maybe OOM.

If it doesn't make a difference then this option is redundant.<br>
<p>
The page stealer can't possibly need memory itself, that would be too stupid. It can't really wait anyway because it's generally called from interrupt, when a page fault happens (or maybe the call is deferred to the process causing the fault). And if it waits then it's a lot slower than the page allocator.<br>
<p>
Deadlock shouldn't be possible whatever value you set. OOM is only more likely with higher values because the kernel only OOMS when it can't allocate memory for itself.<br>

      <p>The page stealer does need memory itself.  I've always hated the lack of strict resource ordering in Linux, such that it avoids deadlock only by parameters being set so that it's really unlikely, but that's the way it is.  The kmalloc pool sits above and below many other layers.  The page stealer is more complex than you're probably thinking, because it can involve, for example, writing the contents of a page to its backing store on a network filesystem.
<p>
There is a flag (PF_MEMALLOC) on a memory request that says, "this request is part of memory allocation itself" or, equivalently, "don't wait for memory under any circumstance."  The requester is supposed to have some way to respond to a failed memory allocation that is better than a deadlock.  For example, it could try to find an easier page to steal.
<p>
Page fault handling does happen in process context.  It normally requires I/O, so interrupt context is pretty much out of the question.
<p>
I remember a similar discussion some years ago, in which someone as an experiment set his minimum free list size to zero, and the system froze.
<p>
Of course, everything here must be taken with a grain of salt because this stuff changes frequently, so what's true of one particular version of kernel isn't necessary true of another.  I do remember being tormented by the network subsystem's requests for memory as part of page stealing and then someone later doing something to ameliorate that.

Peter Zijlstra was busy with a VM deadlock prevention patch a while ago, no idea if that made it or if that PF_MEMALLOC flag came from there.<br>
<p>
Anyway, those cases come from cleaning dirty pages, and the deadlock comes into view when that is triggered by the page stealer, but those paths try to allocate memory and trigger the page stealer again. I wouldn't really say the page stealer is the one needing memory, but rather that to steal dirty pages you sometimes need memory, especially with network file systems. The main problem there being that they need to receive packets to have forward progress in the dirty data writeout (and you don't know before receiving whether it's a critical packet or not). I think they added a memory pool to mostly fix this case.<br>
<p>
Most page faults don't require IO, just memory mapping updates. If a process allocates memory it gets virtual memory, only when it actually uses it real memory is allocated for it. In that case a page fault occurs and a page needs to be allocated and mapped. Same for copy-on-write handling. Looking at the code it seems that the kernel just has to enable interrupts and can continue handling the page fault in process context without doing much special.<br>

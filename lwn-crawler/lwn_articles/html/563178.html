           </div>
<p>
Network port numbers are a finite resource, and each port number can only
be used by one application at a time.  Ensuring that the "right"
application gets a particular port number is important because that
number is required by remote programs trying to connect to the program.
Various methods exist to reserve specific ports, but there are still ways
for an application to lose "its" port.  Enter <a
href="/Articles/563286/">KPortReserve</a>, a Linux Security Module (LSM)
that allows an administrator to ensure that a program gets its reservation.
</p>

<p>
One could argue that KPortReserve does not really make sense as an LSM—in
fact, Tetsuo Handa asked just that question in his RFC post proposing it.
So far, no one has argued that way, and Casey Schaufler <a
href="/Articles/563297/">took the opposite view</a>, but the RFC has only
been posted to the LSM and kernel hardening mailing lists.  The level of
opposition might rise if and when the patch set heads toward the mainline.
</p>

<p>
But KPortReserve does solve a real problem.  Administrators can ensure that
automatic port assignments (i.e. those chosen when the <tt>bind()</tt> port
number is zero) adhere to specific ranges by setting a range or ranges of
ports in the <tt>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_reserved_ports</tt> file.  But
that solution only works for 
applications that do not choose a specific port number.  Programs that <i>do</i>
choose a particular port will be allowed to grab it—possibly at the expense
of the 
administrator's choice.  Furthermore, if the port number is not in the
privileged range (&lt;= 1024), even unprivileged programs can allocate it.

<p>
There is at least one <a
href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/2012/02/15/portreserve-systemd-solution/">existing
user-space solution</a> using <a href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/portreserve/">portreserve</a>, but it still suffers from race
conditions.  Systemd has a race-free way to reserve ports, but it requires
changes to programs that will listen on those ports and is not
available everywhere, which is why Handa turned to a kernel-based solution. 
</p>

<p>
The solution itself is fairly straightforward.  It provides a
<tt>socket_bind()</tt> method in its <tt>struct security_operations</tt> to
intercept <tt>bind()</tt> calls, which checks the reserved list. An
administrator can write 
some values to a control file (where, exactly, that control file
would live and the syntax it would use were being discussed in the thread) to
determine which ports are reserved and what program should be allowed to
allocate them.  For example:
<pre>
    echo '10000 /path/to/server' &gt;/path/to/control/file
</pre>
That would restrict port 10,000 to only being used by the server program
indicated by the path.  A
special "<tt>&lt;kernel&gt;</tt>" string could be used to specify that
the port is reserved for kernel threads.
</p>

<p> 
Vasily Kulikov
<a href="/Articles/563316/">objected</a> to 
specifying that certain <i>programs</i> could bind the port, rather a user ID
or some LSM security context, but Schaufler <a
href="/Articles/563317/">disagreed</a>, calling it "<q>very 21st century
thinking</q>".   His argument is that using unrelated attributes to
govern port reservation could interfere with the normal uses of those
attributes: 
<div class="BigQuote">
[...]  Android used (co-opted, hijacked) the
UID to accomplish this. Some (but not all) aspects of SELinux policy
in Fedora identify the program and its standing within the system.
Both of these systems abuse security attributes that are not intended
to identify programs to do just that. This limits the legitimate use
of those attributes for their original purpose.
<p>
What Tetsuo is proposing is using the information he really cares
about (the program) rather than an attribute (UID, SELinux context,
Smack label) that can be associated with the program. Further, he
is using it in a way that does not interfere with the intended use
of UIDs, labels or any other existing security attribute.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, Handa <a href="/Articles/563318/">noted</a> that all of the
programs he is interested in for this feature are likely running as root.
While it would seem that root-controlled processes could be coordinated so
that they didn't step on each other's ports, there are, evidently,
situations where that is not so easy to arrange.
</p>

<p>
In his initial RFC, Handa wondered if the KPortReserve functionality should
simply be added to the Yama LSM.  At the 2011 Linux Security Summit, Yama
was <a href="/Articles/458652/">targeted</a> as an LSM to hold
discretionary access control (DAC) enhancements, which port reservations
might be shoehorned into—maybe.  But, then and since, there has been a
concern that Yama <i>not</i> become a "dumping ground" for unrelated
security patches.  Thus, Schaufler argued, Yama is not the right place for
KPortReserve.
</p>

<p>
However, there is the <a href="/Articles/518345/">well-known problem</a>
for smaller, targeted LSMs: there is 
currently no way to have more than one LSM active on any given boot of
the system.  Handa's interest in Yama may partly be because it has, over
time, changed from a "normal" LSM to one that can be <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c6993e4ac002c92bc75379212e9179c36d4bf7ee">unconditionally
stacked</a>, which means that it will be called regardless of which LSM is
currently active.  Obviously, if KPortReserve were added to Yama, it would
likewise evade the single-LSM restriction.
</p>

<p>
But, of course, Schaufler has been working on another way around that
restriction for some time now.  There have been attempts to stack (or chain
or compose) LSMs for nearly as long as they have existed, but none has ever
reached the mainline.  The latest entrant, Schaufler's "<a
href="/Articles/560802/">multiple 
concurrent LSMs</a>" patch set, is now up to version 14.  Unlike some
earlier versions, any of the existing LSMs (SELinux, AppArmor, TOMOYO, or
Smack) can now be arbitrarily combined using the technique.  One would
guess it wouldn't be difficult to incorporate a single-hook LSM like
KPortReserve into the mix.
</p>

<p>
While there was some discussion of Schaufler's patches when they were
posted at the end of July—and no objections to the idea—it still is unclear
when (or if) we will see this capability in a mainline kernel.  One senses
that we are getting closer to that point, and new single-purpose LSM ideas
crop up fairly regularly, but we aren't there yet.  Schaufler will be
<a href="http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Linux_Security_Summit_2013/Abstracts/Schaufler">presenting</a> his ideas at the <a
href="http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Linux_Security_Summit_2013">Linux
Security Summit</a> in September.  Perhaps the discussion there will help
clarify the future of this feature.

It isn't entirely related to this, and its not clear if this would solve my oft-pondered "WTF doesn't this exist"?<br>

&lt;=1024 is reserved, based on historical reasons, for root-executed processes. Allegedly, this is because important things run &lt;=1024 and non-important things don't, and this hysterical, er, historical, conclusion fails to pass any sniff test of sanity. There are lots of hosts out their with out any meaningful concept of users; with more granularity in their admin/not distinctions than unix; or less (including Linux appliances that run everything as root)<br>
<p>
So taking some widely used apps, with their own user id's, why _isn't_ there a file thus:<br>
<p>
/etc/portsec<br>
25:smtp<br>
53:named<br>
80:wwwrun<br>
631:cups<br>
<p>
i.e. given users can bind to low ports. Mail servers, web server, dns server, need not run as root even for an instant. Just startup and bind to their standard port. No dropping permissions, no master socket listener waiting to pass things off to a low privilege thread. Just run as whoever and bind to what you are allowed to (at least for &lt;=1024).<br>

<p>
I suppose it's because people think something based on a superuser process is more consistent with Unix overall, more flexible, less work, etc.  I do.
<p>
Other operating systems were designed to have a variety of permission lists, for a variety of fixed kinds of permissions, which is what you're describing, but Unix designers thought it was superior just to have one basic permission: superuser.  Coupled with the setuid flag, that meant application developers could implement an unimaginable variety of permission schemes just by writing code.
<p>
In retrospect, we know that that flexibility creates no end of opportunity for accidentally granting too much permission, but the engineering simplicity of it is still appealing.
<p>
I personally don't like having a server program drop permissions because it means I have to trust the program to drop the permissions, and have duplicate code in every server program.  But I do a similar thing where a single program dedicated to binding ports binds the port, drops permissions, then execs the server program (actually, teh binder execs a program that sets permissions and that program execs the server program).
<p>
That port binder program could easily be setuid superuser and consult a file such as you propose, but I haven't found that maintaining such a file would be preferable to maintaining the scripts that invoke it, which contain the same information.

The reason for the restriction on low numbered ports doesn't have anything to do with "importance", it has to do with a simple mechanism to verify that a particular connection originated from a privileged process (assuming a trusted network). This is extremely important in, e.g., an old-school NFS environment, as the use of the privileged port is the only thing that prevents unprivileged users from making privileged connections to the NFS server. The same sort of model was used for rsh and some other protocols.<br>
<p>
Obviously, in the modern world you'd want to depend on some sort of strong authentication rather than origin port, especially if you're on a trusted network which mixes traditional unix systems with other systems which don't enforce privileged ports or any untrusted network. Nevertheless, as long as people use linux to interoperate with legacy environments it's useful to retain this now-obsolete functionality. It's also useful to understand this model if you run a legacy NFS environment--I've even seen some vendors who have forgotten, and shipped NFS configurations which permitted any user on an NFS client to read any file on an NFS server (scary, and exploited). And if you create any new protocol which depends on this property, you're an idiot. :)<br>

He sure didn't make his point that making permissions based on the program is better than making them based on the uid (or anything else).
<p>
I should be able to run 10 web servers all running Apache, with each entitled to its own unique port.  If I have to vary some attribute to give them different port permissions, I'd much rather give the processes different uids than give Apache different names.
<p>
I find altogether too much conflating of programs with services.
<p>
And I especially didn't get why being 21st century thinking makes it bad.

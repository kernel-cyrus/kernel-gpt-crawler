           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>May 25, 2022</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2022/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
<p>
Steve French led a discussion on change notifications for network
filesystems in a session at the
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM).  He is part of
the Samba team and noted that both Windows and macOS clients get notified
of new and changed files in 
a shared directory immediately, while on Linux that does not happen.  He
wanted to explore what it would take to add that functionality.
</p>

<p>
On Windows and macOS, a file browser automatically shows changes to files
in shared network filesystems, but at some point that broke for Linux
clients.  The inotify mechanism (and its predecessor, dnotify) were added
to the kernel to support the Samba server, he said.  Remote systems that
are talking to a Samba server on Linux can see those kinds of changes, but remote
Linux clients cannot.
</p>

<p>
The client API changed at some point so that network
filesystems have no easy way to register to receive these kinds of events.  For SMB, he
added an <tt>ioctl()</tt> command that can be used wait on notifications of
these changes.  But in order to use that, all of the client programs would
need to change to make a filesystem-specific call in to get that information.
</p>

</a>

<p>
The underlying problem is that the filesystem servers are not told that a Linux client wants to
be notified of changes.  That means Linux file browsers do not have the
functionality that Windows and Mac users have come to expect.  The inotify
functionality does not have a hook into Ceph, AFS, or SMB to
make them aware that a client wants notifications, 
he said.  Chuck Lever noted that NFS
has the notification capability in the protocol, but, like the others, it is not implemented for Linux.
</p>

<p>
There is also the fanotify API, French said, but he does not know if it
would be useful for what he is looking for.  Amir Goldstein said that
fanotify was originally created by antivirus vendors but that, more recently, work has
gone into it to add more functionality.  As of about Linux&nbsp;5.10,
fanotify provides almost a superset of the inotify functionality.
</p>

<p>
One big
feature that inotify lacks has been implemented in fanotify: watching
an entire filesystem.  There are not many applications that use it, because
it is new, Goldstein said.  He has added fanotify support to <a
href="https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools">inotify-tools</a> and
its library, so there are now user-space tools that can be used to watch a
filesystem or set of files using the fanotify API.
</p>

<p>
There are many types of events that an SMB client can get from the server
to tell it about changes to timestamps, file creation, file name changes,
file deletion, and so on, French said.  Those all seem to map reasonably
well to fanotify/inotify events; changes to the access-control lists (ACLs) is
not supported but might need to be, he said.  Goldstein said that if there is
enough interest, event types can be added to fanotify.  
</p>

<p>
On Linux, David Howells said, the file notifications are mostly used by
desktop file managers.  KDE starts a daemon to monitor changes and GNOME
does something similar, he said;  if notifications are not available, then
they poll for the information.  Goldstein said that it is not that
notifications are not available, just that they are not granular enough and that
there may be some kinds of changes that do not have notification events, so
polling is used for those cases.
</p>

<p>
Goldstein said that French had been asking for this feature for a long
time.  The FUSE developers "took a shot at implementing something", he
said; it <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20211025204634.2517-1-iangelak@redhat.com/">added
inotify support for virtiofs</a>.  On the Zoom link, Vivek Goyal, who was
involved in that work, said that inotify
was chosen because it is simpler than fanotify.  Whatever notification watches are
placed on the local file are forwarded to the remote file server, which sets up
inotify and forwards events back to the local filesystem. 
Based on the feedback on those patches, Goyal said, he has been trying to
rework the patches to use fanotify but ran into a number of difficulties. There may
be more limitations when using fanotify.  French said that it is important
to get a handle on what exactly can be supported because the alternative is
"really painful": polling.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara, also via Zoom, said that it should be fairly straightforward to add the hook
for filesystems to inform them that a watch has been added; in the simplest
case, the filesystem just says that it does not support the feature.  The
more difficult part is that when the filesystem receives an event and wants
to get it to the client filesystem in a way that user space can receive it
via fanotify or inotify.  For inotify, the inode number and file name are
available to send to the client, but that is not true for fanotify, where
you may only have the inode number.  Goyal agreed that was the problem for virtiofs.
</p>

<p>
The important thing is to provide a generic mechanism for filesystems so
that applications do not have to use multiple filesystem-specific
interfaces to get this information, French said.  He also wants to avoid polling, which
is particularly expensive when done across the network. Josef Bacik said that it seemed
reasonable to add the hook to let the filesystems know when a watch has been
added; it is up to French and Goyal to work out the details on that.
</p>

<p>
Howells asked about subtree watches; on Windows you can get notified for
changes within a subtree.  He wondered if fanotify could add support for
that.  Goldstein said that it is something that everyone wants, but it is
not trivial to do; several attempts have been made over the years, but
nothing has been added.
</p>

<p>
French said that the feature he is looking for is an asynchronous,
non-perfect mechanism.  Some filesystems, such as SMB and NFS, have strict
approaches using delegations or leases to ensure that all events are seen,
but that is not usually worth the 
cost.  Those could be used to implement these change notifications, but it
should be left up to the filesystem to decide that, he said.
</p>

<p>
As time wound down, French also wanted to mention that he had not seen any
tests for inotify and fanotify in xfstests (which are being renamed to
"fstests").  It will be important to have tests to ensure that nothing
breaks when the remote notifications are added.  But Goldstein said that
the tests for notifications are part of the Linux Test Project (LTP) tests.
There is a test there for every new feature and regression tests for bugs
that have been fixed.
Ted Ts'o said that xfstests have historically been used by the developers of
different filesystems, while features that were implemented in the virtual
filesystem (VFS) layer were tested in LTP.  That may need to change as the
network filesystems add features to support notifications.

It seems remarkable to me that there doesn’t seem to be an abstraction on the user space APIs in the VFS layer? Or is the overlap in functionality so small that it wouldn’t be worth it?<br>

      It is however disabling not to know which user attempted to open or access a file, or caused file event.
<p>
The prudent approach may be to add uid, gid, real and effective user ids to the structure:

<pre>
           struct fanotify_event_metadata {
               __u32 event_len;
               __u8 vers;
               __u8 reserved;
               __u16 metadata_len;
               __aligned_u64 mask;
               __s32 fd;
               __s32 pid;
           };
</pre>

It doesn't seem to have to break anything, since programs rely on even_len rather than sizeof (struct fanotify) to get data.
<p>
Rationale: it is possible to lookup which user is the owner of the PID, however, while that information is being searched for, the process may exit already.
<p>
It also involves a race condition. And it may not be the same which user we give an access to file to. Lookup in /proc file system is expensive and inefficient. :-(

Wouldn&#x27;t that be difficult for network filesystems in particular. You don&#x27;t really have uids that are the same across the whole network filesystem scope (server + all clients).<br>

      IMHO, from the security point of view, it would be very useful i.e. to know which user is trying to modify /bin/bash on local filesystem.
If this is a user named jdoe@localhost, and he is not one of the admins, then Huston we have a problem!
<p>
IMNSHO, the network file system's integrity should be the responsibility of the NSF, SMB or other server ...
<p>
A process could request (for example) <code><b>IN_EVENT_UID</b></code> in the list of events listened to, and the fs driver could reply with <code>EINVAL</code> or perhaps even more distinctive <code><b>EREMOTE</b></code> (Object is remote).

Hi.<br>
<p>
Good to see there is attention for fsnotify methods (inotify, fanotify) and network filesystems. Earlier I've been pretty busy why this does not work on Linux, and wrote this about it (only FUSE):<br>
<p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/wiki/Fsnotify-and-FUSE">https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/wiki/Fsnotify-and-FUSE</a><br>
<p>
One citation about why it does not work: "In short: the individual filesystems do not "know" a watch has been set, and thus cannot react on that."<br>
I've written some patches back then, which made the fsnotify subsystem in Linux informs the VFS fuse kernel module when a watch has been set (or changed or removed).  That worked, but later I came to the conviction that handling of this is far better of in userspace, than in the kernel.<br>

In network filesystems, you are working in an network enviroment right? And when you want fsnotify to work in an network environment, it's because you want that applications like a filemanager, but also officesuites for example are informed about changes made by others, on other hosts (because changes made on the same host you are working on does work ...). <br>
Now I think that users are not only interested in seeing a simple event like a file is created in a watched folder, but also by who (a user in username@domain.org notation) from what host. You can do a lot in the kernel, but you can never let a network filesystem in the kernel pass through  this information. A better way to do this is doing this in userspace. <br>
<p>
Some time ago there was a special service for that (FAM = File Alteration Monitor) but that is not used anymore.<br>
<p>
The way it should work in my opinion:<br>
- there is a dedicated service which offers a fs change notify service to applications<br>
- applications can ask (via mask) what info they want: apart from pretty standard events like a file is added, removed or changed/modified, also by who, from what host and time.<br>
- this service checks the filesystem the watch has been set upon: if its a not a networkfs and not a fuse fs use the native fs method, which is fanotify at this moment for Linux. This method provides ways to determine who (via pid) caused the event.<br>
- when dealing with a FUSE fs, the daemon is running in userspace, then it should be not so hard to forward the watch request to this daemon. This daemon can than (if it supports this, otherwise fallback to default which is fanotify) reply what info it can handle, and possibly provide the information when an event on the backend occurs.<br>

I'm working in a set of software (OSNS, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/stefbon/OSNS">https://github.com/stefbon/OSNS</a>) based upon the SSH protocol, MDNS and FUSE and this is doable.<br>
With a network filesystem in the kernel (cifs) this is harder. <br>
<p>
I'm very interested in what you think,<br>

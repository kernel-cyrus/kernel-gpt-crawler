<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 8, 2011</br>
           </div>
The "vsyscall" and "vDSO" segments are two mechanisms used to accelerate
certain system calls in Linux.  While their basic function (provide fast access
to functionality which does not need to run in kernel mode) is the same,
there are some distinct differences between them.  Recently vsyscall has
come to be seen as an enabler of security attacks, so some patches have
been put together to phase it out.  The discussion of those patches shows
that the disagreement over how security issues are handled by the community
remains as strong as ever.
<p>
The vsyscall area is the older of these two mechanisms.  It was added as a
way to execute specific system calls which do not need any real level of
privilege to run.  The classic example is <tt>gettimeofday()</tt>; all it
needs to do is to read the kernel's idea of the current time.  There are
applications out there that call <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> frequently, to the
point that they care about even a little bit of overhead.  To address that
concern, the kernel allows the page containing the current time to be
mapped read-only into user space; that page also contains a fast
<tt>gettimeofday()</tt> implementation.  Using this virtual system call,
the C library can provide a fast <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> which never
actually has to change into kernel mode.
<p>
Vsyscall has some limitations; among other things, there is only space for
a handful of virtual system calls.  As those limitations were hit, the
kernel developers introduced the more flexible vDSO implementation.  A
quick look on a contemporary system will show that both are still in use:
<p>
<pre>
    $ cat /proc/self/maps
    ...
    7fffcbcb7000-7fffcbcb8000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0            [vdso]
    ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0    [vsyscall]
</pre>
<p>
The key to the current discussion can be seen by typing the same command
again and comparing the output:
<p>
<pre>
    7fff379ff000-7fff37a00000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0             [vdso]
    ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0     [vsyscall]
</pre>
<p>
Note that the vDSO area has moved, while the vsyscall page remains at the
same location.  The location of the vsyscall page is nailed down in the
kernel ABI, but the vDSO area - like most other areas in the user-space
memory layout - has its location randomized every time it is mapped.
<p>
Address-space layout randomization is a form of defense against security
holes.  An attacker who is able to overrun the stack can often arrange for
a function in the target process to "return" to an arbitrary address.
Depending on what instructions are found at that address, this return can
cause almost anything to happen.  Returning into the <tt>system()</tt>
function in the C library is an obvious example; it can be used to execute
arbitrary commands.  If the location of the C library in memory is not
known, though, then it becomes difficult or impossible for an exploit to
jump into a useful place.
<p>
There is no <tt>system()</tt> function in the vsyscall page, but there are
several machine instructions that invoke system calls.  With just a bit of setup, these
instructions might be usable in a stack overrun attack to invoke an
arbitrary system call with attacker-defined parameters - not a desirable
outcome.  So it would be nice to get rid of - or at least randomize the
location of - the vsyscall page to thwart this type of attack.
Unfortunately, applications depend on the existence and exact address of
that page, so nothing can be done.
<p>
Except that Andrew Lutomirski <a href="/Articles/446220/">found something
that could be done</a>: remove all of the useful instructions from the
vsyscall page.  One was associated with the <tt>vsyscall64</tt> sysctl
knob, which is really only useful for user-mode Linux (and does not work
properly even there); it was simply deleted.  Others weren't actually
system call instructions as such: the system time, if jumped into (and,
thus, executed as if it were code) when it held just
the right value, looks like a system call instruction.  To address that problem,
variables have been moved into a separate page with execute permission
turned off.
<p>
The remaining code in the vsyscall page has simply been removed and
replaced by a special trap instruction.  An application trying to call into
the vsyscall page will trap into the kernel, which will then emulate the
desired virtual system call in kernel space.  The result is a kernel system
call emulating a virtual system call which was put there to avoid the
kernel system call in the first place.  The result is a "vsyscall" which
takes a fraction of a microsecond longer to execute but, crucially, does
not break the existing ABI.  In any case, the slowdown will only be seen if
the application is trying to use the vsyscall page instead of the vDSO.
<p>
Contemporary applications should not be doing that most of the time, except
for one little problem: glibc still uses the vsyscall version of
<tt>time()</tt>.  That has been fixed in the glibc repository, but the fix
may not find its way out to users for a while; meanwhile, <tt>time()</tt>
calls will be a little slower than they were before.  That should not
really be an issue, but one never knows, so Andy put in a configuration
option to preserve the old way of doing things.  Anybody worried about the
overhead of an emulated vsyscall page can set
<tt>CONFIG_UNSAFE_VSYSCALLS</tt> to get the old behavior.
<p>
Nobody really objected to the patch series as a whole, but Linus hated the
name of the configuration option; he asked that it be called
<tt>CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALLS</tt> instead.  Or, even better, the change
could just be done unconditionally.  That led to a fairly predictable
<a href="/Articles/446542/">response</a>
from the PaX developer on how the kernel community likes to hide security
problems, to which Linus <a href="/Articles/446539/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Calling the old vdso "UNSAFE" as a config option is just plain
	stupid.  It's a politicized name, with no good reason except for
	your political agenda. And when I call it out as such, you just
	spout the same tired old security nonsense.
</div>
<p>
Suffice to say that the conversation went downhill from there; interested
parties can follow the thread links in the messages cited above.  
<p>

One useful point from that discussion is that the static vsyscall page is
not, in fact, a security vulnerability; it's simply a resource which can
make it easier for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability elsewhere in the
system.  Whether that aspect makes that page "unsafe" or merely "legacy" is
left as an exercise for the reader.  Either way, removing it is seen as a
good idea even though that removal might, arguably, cause real security
bugs to remain unfixed in the kernel; the argument is all about naming.

<p>
Final versions of the patches have not been posted as of this writing, but
the shape they will take is fairly clear.  The static vsyscall page will
not continue to exist in its current form, and applications which still use
it will continue to work but will get a little bit slower.  The
configuration option controlling this 
behavior may or may not exist, but any distribution shipping a kernel
containing this change (presumably 3.1 or later) will also have a C library
which no longer tries to use the vsyscall page.  And, with luck, exploiting
vulnerabilities will get just a little bit harder.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Not least because there is a spray of reports of what look like rather serious bugs in 2.14 on libc-alpha, but (as usual) no movement at all from the libc maintainers towards anything like a backport. So we have to wait until a 2.14 maintainer gets sorted out and figures out what patches might fix it, with the usual no help at all from the people who introduced the bugs in the first place.<br>

      On i386, randomizing the address of the vDSO slows down the loading of prelinked shared libraries.  Even /bin/cat, which uses just /lib/libc.so, suffers on 7% of invocations.  Large GUI executables with many shared libraries suffer 60% of the time or more.  <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=162797#c4">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=162797#c4</a>

           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>September 10, 2008</br>

<p>
A patch to add some security checks before making system calls would seem
like a reasonable addition to the kernel, but because it is, at best, a
half-measure, it received a less than enthusiastic response.  
Preventing rootkits&mdash;malware that alters the kernel to hide its
presence and function&mdash;from altering the system call table was the
rationale 
behind the patch, but it would only work for the current crop of
rootkits.  Once that change was made, rootkit authors would just change their
<i>modus 
operandi</i> in response.
</p>

<p>
There are many possible
ways that a root user&mdash;or malware running as root&mdash;can modify a
Linux system to run rootkit code. Some currently "popular" rootkits modify
the system call table, though it is ostensibly read-only.  Some commercial malware
scanners that run on Linux have also been known to use this technique.  In
both cases, certain system 
calls are re-routed from the standard kernel code to code that lives
elsewhere.  That code, running in kernel mode, can then do just about
anything it wants with the system.
</p>

<p>
Arjan van de Ven proposed a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/296926/">patch</a> that hooked into the
system call entry code to check the
address of the call to ensure that it was within the addresses
occupied by kernel code.  He describes the change and its impact this way:
<div class="BigQuote">
The patch below, while obviously not perfect protection against malware,
adds some cheap sanity checks to the syscall path to verify the
system call is actually still in the kernel code region and not some
external-to-this region such as a rootkit.
<p>
The overhead is very minimal; measured at 2 cycles or less.
(this is because the branches get predicted right and the rest of the
code is almost perfectly parallelizable... and an indirect function call
is a branch issue anyway)
</div>
</p>

<p>
Various kernel hackers pointed out the flaws inherent in that scheme.  As Andi
Kleen succinctly <a href="/Articles/297628/">puts it</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
This just means that the root kits will switch to patch
the first instruction of the entry points instead.
[...]
So the protection will be zero to minimal, but the overhead will
be there forever.
</div>
</p>

<p>
One of the more interesting ideas to come out of the discussion was Alan
Cox's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/297622/">thoughts</a> on using a
hypervisor to enforce protections: 
<div class="BigQuote">
The only place you can expect to make a difference here is in virtualised
environments by teaching KVM how to provide 'irrevocably read only' pages
to guests where the guest OS isn't permitted to change the rights back or
the virtual mapping of that page.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/297631/">described</a> a rather complicated
scheme that might increase the likelihood of a rootkit being detected, but
with a fairly high cost&mdash;in build complexity as well as the ability
to debug the resulting kernel.  The compiler would be changed to insert
calls to rootkit checks randomly throughout the kernel binary in ways that
would be 
difficult or impossible for a rootkit to detect and evade.  In the end,
though, a rootkit could simply install a new kernel that does exactly what
it wants, then cause, or wait for, a reboot.
</p>

<p>
Without some kind of hardware enforcement (e.g. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">Trusted
Platform Module</a>) or locked-down virtualization, Linux is defenseless
against attacks that run as 
root.  The kernel could change to thwart a particular kind of attack, such
as van de Ven's patch, but other kinds of attacks will still succeed.  It
is clearly a situation where "<q>the only way to win is not to play this
game</q>", as Pavel Machek&mdash;amongst others&mdash;<a
href="/Articles/297666/">noted</a> in the thread.
</p>

<p>
In the end, van de Ven wrote off the patch as an exercise in measuring the
cost of this kind of runtime checking.  It was fairly low cost solution,
but without any major upside.  The real upside was getting kernel hackers
thinking about the problem, which could lead to some better solutions
down the road.

<p>
I guess you mean getting a rootkit to install into the kernel would be more difficult.  But as there would be correspondingly more places than the kernel into which to install a rootkit, I don't think the overall ease of installing a rootkit would be any different.
<p>
Note that even with Linux as it exists, a decent rootkit need not touch the kernel.

No, Linux is <em>not</em> based on Minix (which is a microkernel, by the way). Linux was written according to published Unix design.
<p>
This common misconception is due to Linus running Minix for 386 while developing Linux. Fortunately, when Linus fat-fingered and killed his Minix, Linux was already far enough along to fight it on its own.

If u have implement any rootkits, u will know that the best way to do it IS NOT hook at the syscall level (eg, because "sys_read" can be used for so many purposes).   Instead, it is much better to do it at the lower level (eg, VFS layer).   But if u can hook the syscall table, and so can u unpatch the patch that Arjan has put in to protect the syscall table.   And likewise, many other techniques like making the ".text" region read-executable only, is really a joke - because u can easily undo it if u are a rootkit.   Eg, ftrace have to make the region writeable momentarily and then switching it back to readonly - exactly the same sequence of steps can be executed by the rootkit kernel module as well.   In general "rootkit" means that the system is alreayd 0wned (or compromised).   Comments?<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 12, 2018</br>
           </div>
One of the many longstanding — though unwritten — rules of kernel
development is that infrastructure is not merged until at least one user
for that infrastructure exists.  That helps developers evaluate potential
interfaces and be sure that the proposed addition is truly needed.  A big
exception to this rule was made when the heterogeneous memory management
(HMM) code was merged, though.  One of the reasons for the lack of users in
this case turns out to be that many of the use cases are proprietary; that
has led to some disagreements over the GPL-only status of an exported
kernel symbol.
<p>
The HMM subsystem exists to support peripherals that have direct access to
system memory through their own memory-management units.  It allows the
ownership of ranges of memory to be passed back and forth and notifies
peripherals of changes in memory mappings to keep everything working well
together.  HMM is not a small or simple subsystem, and bringing it into the
kernel has forced a number of low-level memory-management changes.  After a
multi-year development process, the core HMM code was merged for the 4.14
kernel, despite the lack of any users.
<p>
The immediate issue has to do with HMM's use of <tt><a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/memremap.c#L319">devm_memremap_pages()</a></tt>,
which allows the mapping of pages that exist in device memory.  Early
versions of HMM used this function before switching to <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/hmm.c#L1026">an
internal version</a> with some changes.  Dan Williams recently posted <a
href="/Articles/757133/">a patch series</a> adjusting
<tt>devm_memremap_pages()</tt> and changing HMM to use it, getting rid of
the duplicated code.  That change is
not controversial, but one other part of the patch set is:
he changed the export declaration of <tt>devm_memremap_pages()</tt> to
<tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()</tt>.
<p>
There are, of course, two ways to export symbols from the kernel to
loadable modules, with and without the <tt>_GPL</tt> suffix.  Symbols exported
with that suffix will be unavailable to any module that does not declare a
GPL-compatible license.  It is a statement that, in the developers' belief,
any use of those symbols will necessarily make the module a derived work of
the kernel.  In this case, the proposed changes will make it harder for
proprietary modules to use HMM.
<p>
Jérôme Glisse, the author of HMM, is naturally <a
href="/Articles/757135/">opposed</a> to this change, since it defeats part
of the purpose for HMM in the first place.  Dave Airlie has also <a
href="/Articles/757136/">questioned the change</a>, noting that
<tt>devm_memremap_pages()</tt> was exported normally for three years and
wondering what has changed:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If something wasn't a derived work for 3 years using that API, then
	it isn't a derived work now 3 years later because you changed the
	marker. Retrospectively changing the markers doesn't really make
	any sense legally or otherwise.
</div>
<p>
Williams <a href="/Articles/757137/">responded</a> that the initial marking
of the symbol was "<q>an oversight</q>" that is being corrected now.
In support of the claim that any user of <tt>devm_memremap_pages()</tt>
must be derived from the kernel, he pointed out that turning on this
remapping capability changes the kernel 
fundamentally.  The reverse of Airlie's logic also works: if a user of this
functionality was a derived work of the kernel before, the non-GPL status
of the export will not have changed that fact.
<p>
Williams further <a href="/Articles/757139/">explained</a> the reasoning
behind his proposed changes as:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	My concern is the long term health and maintainability of the Linux
	kernel. HMM exports deep Linux internals out to proprietary drivers
	with no way for folks in the wider kernel community to validate
	that the interfaces are necessary or sufficient besides "take
	Jerome's word for it".
</div>
<p>
The rest of his message perhaps gets closer to the real source of this
particular dispute, though: the fact that there are no in-tree users of the
HM functionality.
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Every time I've pushed back on any HMM feature the response is
	something to the effect of, "no, out of tree drivers need this".
	HMM needs to grow upstream users and the functionality needs to be
	limited to whatever those upstream users exploit. Since there are
	no upstream users of HMM, we should delete it unless / until those
	users arrive.
</div>
<p>
Glisse has <a href="/Articles/757141/">a response</a> to all of these
complaints.  HMM, he says, is meant to isolate drivers from core
memory-management internals rather than tying them together.  There is a
user now in the form of <a href="/Articles/752966/">patches to the
Nouveau driver</a> for NVIDIA 
GPUs; he said he hopes to get that code upstream in 4.19.  And upstreaming
the pieces, he said, has been "<q>a big chicken and egg
nightmare</q>" with a lot of independent pieces to prepare together;
that has made it hard to get the users merged along with the infrastructure.
<p>
The merging of the Nouveau code, if and when it happens, should resolve the
question of whether HMM should be in the kernel at all; it might reopen
some questions about specific HMM interfaces, though.  The question about
the GPL-only export may prove harder to reach a conclusion on, though.
There is no easy or
objective standard for deciding whether the use of a specific kernel
function makes a module into a derived work; it usually comes down to the
judgment of the developers who wrote the code in the first place.  In this
case, those developers are Williams and Christoph Hellwig, who has 
<a href="/Articles/757183/">stated</a> that he is
willing to enforce the GPL against users of <tt>devm_memremap_pages()</tt>.
<p>
While a case could thus be made for changing the status of this symbol,
it's not at all clear what will actually happen.  Either Andrew Morton or
Linus Torvalds will almost certainly end up making the final decision.
It is more clear, though,
that a number of developers are unhappy with the no-users status of HMM in
the kernel.  The most likely outcome of this particular episode may end up
being a redoubling of the community's determination not to accept new
subsystems into the kernel until users exist.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I've long viewed EXPORT_SYMBOL* as an aid to self-auditing for mistakes/accidents, not as legal advice.<br>
<p>
And while in the thread they were talking about the way it interacts with kernel internals as being a guide to deciding whether it should be EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL or not, I think that doesn't align well with a reasonable copyright-informed interpretation.<br>
<p>
I feel a better question to guide that decisionmaking might be "To what degree are the concepts and interfaces linux-specific?".  This also aligns somewhat with Linus's stance that driver code written for other OSes and ported to Linux doesn't de facto derive from Linux (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/13398/">https://lwn.net/Articles/13398/</a>).<br>

The first two have some integrity. Ubuntu practically bends over backwards to make filling the system with crapware as easy as possible.<br>
<p>
That's how we ended up with the current swamp of proprietary and/or Electron-based software that advertise support for “Linux”, where in practice that usually means “Ubuntu $(($year - 6)), x86-32 only, good luck with anything else”. I don't think making concessions at this point will make that situation go away, unfortunately.<br>

I don't think Cyberax particularly hates GPL - he just doesn't consider it "fit for purpose". And I find I quite often agree ...<br>
<p>
The other problem I see - I don't know if it's happening here - is that some people seem to have this need to relabel OTHER PEOPLE'S code as GPL. As far as copyrights and legalities are concerned, this can start to get VERY hairy, VERY fast. If I choose NOT to stick "GPL" on the end of my export, I don't want other people changing it.<br>

The issue here is that in the kernel, some symbols (variables, functions, …) are marked as OK to use in non-free third-party modules, and a superset of those is marked as OK to use in GPL third-party modules. Sometimes it turns out that someone working on a non-free third-party module would really love to use one of the symbols that are only available to GPL modules. Since the only thing standing between such a developer and using the symbol is the missing <tt>EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL</tt> declaration, Cyberax suggests that such a developer should go right ahead and relabel the symbol in their copy of the kernel, because nobody cares enough to police that sort of thing.
</p>
<p>
Personally I think if you do something like that and it comes out, as it inevitably will sooner or later, that will certainly not make you popular in the Linux kernel community. Whether that is an actual problem as far as you're concerned is for you to decide.

The VMWare suit has shown us that GPL is pretty much unenforceable. That’s why I think that Apache-style licenses are,way better.<br>

"....the core HMM code was merged for the 4.14 kernel, despite the lack of any users"  Why?? any specific reason for that? Yet another thing to maintain for no apparent reason ...heck ...look like I am missing the big picture.<br>

Work has been ongoing for a while for nouveau support, although it is quite non-trivial.. changes to kernel driver, ofc, but also bringing up clover/opencl on nouveau in userspace, lots of shader compiler infrastructure work, etc.  So it is at least nice not to be having to carry around and rebase the HMM patchset in addition to all this.<br>

There are more users around the corner. Us (IBM) have a secure VM mechanism we are working on that relies on HMM to handle migration between secure and insecure memory for example. For various reasons, using HMM wouldn't have been an option for us had it not already been upstream (hint: distro dependencies and schedules) and it's saving us a huge amount of extra work and horrible hacking into the guts of the VM.<br>

I disagree with the claim that "many of the [HMM] use cases" are inherently proprietary. At AMD we're working on a fully open source and upstream driver that will use HMM's page table mirroring and migration features. In fact we were not able to submit the first round of changes in 4.19 because HMM was broken. That's just a reminder of the chicken-and-egg problem here.<br>

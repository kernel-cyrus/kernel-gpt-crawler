<h1>Counting on the time stamp counter</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted November 13, 2006 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
The time stamp counter (TSC) is a hardware feature found on a number of
contemporary processors.  The TSC is a special register which is simply
incremented every clock cycle.  Since the clock is the fundamental unit of
time as seen by the processor, the TSC provides the highest-resolution
timing information available for that processor.  It can thus be used for a
number of applications, such as measuring the exact time cost of specific
instructions or operations.
<p>

The TSC can also be read quickly (it is just a CPU register, after all),
making it of interest for system timekeeping.  There are a lot of
applications which check the current time frequently, to the point that
<tt>gettimeofday()</tt> is one of the most performance-critical system
calls in Linux.  By using the TSC to interpolate within the resolution of a coarser
clock, the system can give accurate, high-resolution time without taking a
lot of time in the process.
<p>

That is the idea, anyway.  In practice, the TSC turns out to be hard to use
in this way.  If the CPU frequency changes (as it will on CPUs which can
vary their power consumption), the TSC rate will change as well.  If the
processor is halted (as can happen when it goes idle), the TSC may stop
altogether.  On multiprocessor systems, the TSCs on different processors
may drift away from each other over time - leading to a situation where a
process could read a time on one CPU, move to a second processor, and
encounter a time earlier than the one it read on the first processor.
<p>

These challenges notwithstanding, the Linux kernel tries to make the best
use of the TSC possible.  The code which deals with the TSC contains a
number of checks to try to detect situations where TSC-based time might not
be reliable.  One of those checks, in particular, compares TSC time against
the jiffies count, which is incremented by way of the timer tick.  If,
after ten seconds' worth of ticks, the number of TSC cycles seen differs
from what would have been expected, the kernel concludes that the TSC is
not stable and stops using it for time information.
<p>

Interesting things happen when the dynamic tick patch is thrown into the
mix.  With dynamic ticks, the periodic timer interrupt is turned off
whenever there's nothing to be done in the near future, allowing the
processor to remain idle for longer and consume less power.  Once something
happens, however, the <tt>jiffies</tt> count must be updated to reflect the
timer ticks which were missed - something which is generally done by
obtaining the time from another source.  At best, this series of events
defeats the test which ensures that the TSC is operating in a stable
manner; at worst, it can lead to corrupted system time.  Not a good state
of affairs.
<p>

For this reason, the recently-updated <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/209038/">high-resolution timers and dynamic
tick patch set</a> includes a change which disables use of the TSC.  It
seems that the high-resolution timers and dynamic tick features are
incompatible with the TSC - and that people configuring kernels must choose
between the two.  Since the TSC does have real performance benefits,
disabling it has predictably made some people unhappy, to the point that
some would prefer to see the timer patches remain out of the kernel for
now.
<p>

In response to the objections, Ingo Molnar has <a
href="/Articles/209167/">explained</a> things this way:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We just observed that in the past 10 years no generally working
	TSC-based gettimeofday was written (and i wrote the first version
	of it for the Pentium, so the blame is on me too), and that we
	might be better off without it. If someone can pull off a working
	TSC-based gettimeofday() implementation then there's no objection
	from us.
</div>
<p>
Ingo has also posted <a href="/Articles/209168/">a test program</a> which
demonstrates that time inconsistencies on TSC-based systems are common - at
least, when multiple processors are in use.
<p>
Arjan van de Ven has <a href="/Articles/209169/">suggested</a> a "duct
tape" solution which might work well enough "to keep the illusion alive."
It involves setting up offsets and multipliers for each processor's TSC.
Between the offsets (which could compensate for TSC drift between
processors) and the multipliers (which adjust for frequency changes), some
semblance of synchronized and accurate TSC-based time could be maintained -
as long as the kernel is able to detect TSC-related events and adjust those
values accordingly.  No code which implements this idea has yet been
posted, however.
<p>

The conversation faded out with no real conclusion, though, near the end,
Thomas Gleixner did <a href="/Articles/209170/">note</a> that the complete
disabling of the TSC was "overkill."  The preferred solution, which he is
working on, is to keep the system from going into the dynamic tick mode if
there is no other reliable timer available.  Once that code has been
posted, it may be possible to have the full set: high-resolution timers,
dynamic ticks, and fast clocks using the TSC.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
This theory has never been correct for x86 processors.  The minimum cost for <tt>rdtsc</tt> was 9 cycles in a PentiumMMX-166MHz.  On a Pentium4Xeon-3.0GHz it takes 97 cycles.  The conclusion?  The hardware reads TSC serially one bit at a time, or one byte at a time on old processors.

      The rumor I hear is that reading TSC does some degree of instruction-stream serialization.  Someone from Intel or AMD might be able to shed better light on the performance of rdtsc.<br>

      One way of guaranteeing that &lsquo;time never goes backwards&rsquo; is to use a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps" >Lamport timestamps</a> (or see <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/time-clocks.pdf" >full paper</a>).  For gettimeofday, we have it a bit easier: gettimeofday gives only microsecond precision, so it only guarantees that time never goes backwards, it doesn't guarantee that time advances between two events.  Thus, we don't even need the property that distinct events have distinct timestamps, so we don't need the process ID stuff mentioned on that page, and we could go so far as to ~gratuitously drop the &ldquo;and then applies rule 1 before timestamping the event as received&rdquo; part from rule 3.

<p>[Dropping that part of rule 3 would more often expose callers mistakenly assuming that time strictly increases.  Exposing bugs more often may be either a good or bad thing.]</p>

      Programmers need to realize that they cannot have both monotonically non-decreasing (or monotonically increasing) *and* "correlates to shared human date-time e.g. UTC".  Sometimes you require the latter and can live without the former.  Sometimes it is the other way around.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately Unix and Linux haven't traditionally offered the former to user-land programmers (although I'm told that Linux kernel code itself has long required monotonic timers for some things).<br>
<p>
The current state of the art appears to be an ill-considered belief that you can have most of both most of the time (possibly because there is a human sysadmin finessing the difference for you) and and that the occasional violation of one or both of those requirements probably won't hurt too much.  Bah.  I hate that kind of irresponsible engineering.<br>
<p>
("Occasional incorrectness won't hurt too much" thinking can often get by for years -- until a malicious actor gets involved who knows how to cause or to exploit this occasional incorrectness.  In any case occasional incorrectness can occasionally cause planes to crash, precious documents to be deleted, etc.)<br>
<p>
I believe that recent modern Linux and glibc do offer a monotonically increasing timer (i.e. implementing CLOCK_MONOTONIC for clock_gettime()).  Now if only programmers will come to realize that they sometimes need it...<br>
<p>
(P.S.  An even more subtle and vexing problem is that you cannot have both monotonicity *and* "the rate of the passage of time correlates with a standard notion of the rate of time".)<br>

<p>
Can you elaborate?  I think you're saying that if I want a clock that correlates to UTC, it must necessarily step backwards sometimes.  I don't see why.

      I guess zooko allured to leap seconds, where UTC stands still for <br>
(acually: jumps backwards by) a second. Maybe keeping TAI and the current <br>
delta is the answer to this one?<br>

<p>
Ah.  That's probably it.
<p>
Except that UTC does not stand still or go backwards.  When there's a leap second, UTC goes steadily forward from 23:59:59 to 23:59:60 and then to 00:00:00.  Note that a UTC time of day is a tuple of numbers (year, month, day, hour, minute, second).
<p>
But the standard Linux time representation (a single number) <em>does</em> step backward at leap second time; it's defined that way to make it easy to compute UTC from it.
<p>
And I think zooko's statement that a programmer can't have a time that is both monotonically nondecreasing and correlates to a human time standard has to be qualified to the case that the time is represented by a single number.  As long as you're willing to work with multiple numbers, two obvious ways are TAI + delta as you suggest, and just plain UTC.

      Interesting, I've been seeing soft-locks for months as well.  Oddly enough though almost nothing else responds on my laptop (basically only the keyboard lamp), toggling volume up and down will sometimes pop it out of lockup immediately.<br>

      It is quite remarkable just how many clocks are in a typical PC, all of which have serious drawbacks. Vojtech Pavlik provided a nice <A href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/18/261">summary</A> a while back:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> RTC: 0.5 sec resolution, interrupts
<LI> PIT: takes ages to read, overflows at each timer interrupt
<LI> PMTMR: takes ages to read, overflows in approx 4 seconds, no interrupt
<LI> HPET: slow to read, overflows in 5 minutes. Nice, but usually not present.
<LI> TSC: fast, completely unreliable. Frequency changes, CPUs diverge over time.
<LI> LAPIC: reasonably fast, unreliable, per-cpu
</OL>
<P>
Linux timekeeping has always been a black art, and until John Stultz's rewrite, seemed to me to proceed from the wrong direction.  At least now it  looks comprehensible.
<P>
Do other kernels (*BSD, Solaris) take a markedly different approach?
<P>
There does seem to be some work going on to make the TSC more useful on SMP systems, e.g., <A href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/13/373">[PATCH 1/2] Make the TSC safe to be used by gettimeofday()</A>.

coverage</a>. 
</td></tr></table>

Suparna  Bhattacharya led a session on RAS (reliability, serviceability, and
availability) tools.  The state of the art has advanced somewhat in the
last year; this session was thus mostly a status report, rather than a
place where future work was to be discussed.
<p>

The kexec and kdump patches (last <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/140975/">covered here</a> in June) have been
merged into the mainline.  Together these patches enable the creation of a
far more reliable crash dump capability than Linux has had in the past.
There is still work to be done, however, much of it in user space, to get
crash dumps to a point where they can be deployed by vendors.
<p>
There's also a few remaining issues.  Driver initialization is one of them;
after a kernel crash (or any other invocation of a new kernel with kexec)
the BIOS initialization will not have been performed.  So drivers will have
to reset their hardware from an unknown initial state.  Getting the frame
buffer back into working condition is a challenge in the best of times, and
will be made more difficult in a panic situation.  It is also important to
put an end to any DMA operations which may have been happening when the
kernel crash took place.  That, in turn, may require a big bus reset,
something the kernel normally tries to avoid doing.  All of this implies
that the kernel needs a flag saying "this is a crash dump kernel" so that
it can take the appropriate steps.
<p>

Keeping the analysis tools in sync with the kernel will also be a
challenge; the high rate of change affects these tools just as much as it
affects drivers.  Crash dumps are most likely to be used with "enterprise"
distribution kernels, however, which do not change very often.
<p>

There was some talk of relayfs, a tool for getting large amounts of trace
data out of the kernel in a hurry.  It turns out that the current relayfs
implementation allows the trace data to be read via <tt>mmap()</tt>, but
not via a normal <tt>read()</tt> call.  There was a strange discussion on
whether it was appropriate to implement <tt>read()</tt> until Linus decreed
that it was silly not to.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Just a quick observation - first failure data capture tools are pretty useful in general and not likely to be limited to "enterprise" distributions (even though that is where the tools have been most desperately needed). For example kexec based crash dumps have already been used for resolving problems reported by testers during regular kernel development, and now that it is in mainline, wider use for better bug reporting will hopefully help improve the rate of resolution of bugs and hence quality of kernel development. Likewise with probe handler utilities. This is why keeping sync is an especially important design issue to be tackled, so that the tools are useful all through.<br>

      Completely agree with Suparna, the sync of kernel with tools is must. Many of the enterprise class kernels (aix, solaris, irix) kept the provision for tools by design and not as addon, thats why maintainability is so easy.<br>
<p>
In case of linux "Reliable" first crash analysis support would definately improve the quality the kernel.<br>
<p>
One of my expectations of summit was a road map for future apart from status. Any idea from from anybody would be useful. I still believe that "kernel stress testing" is big challenge. Creation of uncertain scenario and creating extreme load conditions are far away from LTP or any similar tools which i have seen yet.<br>

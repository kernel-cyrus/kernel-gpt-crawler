<p>The Linux kernel gained a new subsystem during the <a
href="/Articles/708766/">4.9</a> development cycle.  That
subsystem is Greybus and this article will briefly take you through its
internals.</p>

<p>Greybus was initially designed for Google's <a
href="https://atap.google.com/ara/">Project Ara</a> smartphone (which is <a
href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm">discontinued</a>
now), but the first (and only) product released with it is Motorola's
<a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/moto-mods">Moto Mods</a>. There are
discussions going on to evaluate the feasibility of using the 
protocols provided by Greybus in applications like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of
things</a>, and for other 
parts of the kernel that need to communicate in a platform-independent
way.</p>

<p>Initially, Greg Kroah-Hartman tried to merge Greybus core in the
kernel's <tt>drivers</tt>
directory but, after some objections (people
wanted to do more detailed reviews before merging it) everyone agreed to
merge it into the staging tree instead. Almost
2400 patches, developed over 2.5 years, were merged; these
contributions came from over 50 developers representing at least five
organizations (Google, <a 
href="https://www.linaro.org/">Linaro</a>, <a
href="http://baylibre.com/">BayLibre</a>, <a
href="http://www.leaflabs.com/">LeafLabs</a>, and <a
href="https://www.mm-sol.com/">MMSolutions</a>). There were a lot more
developers and companies involved in the development of the other parts of
the Ara 
software and hardware.  Greybus developers also showed up in the <a
href="/Articles/708266/">list</a> of most active developers
(the top four by changesets) for the 4.9 release.</p>

<p>Kroah-Hartman made sure that Greybus was merged with all its history
preserved, 
<a href="/Articles/700618/">saying</a>:</p>
<div class="BigQuote">
Because this was 2 1/2 years of work, with many many developers
contributing, I didn't want to flatten all of their effort into a few
small patches, as that wouldn't be very fair.  So I've built a git tree
with all of the changes going back to the first commit, and merged it
into the kernel tree, just like btrfs was merged into the kernel.
</div>

<p>Jonathan Corbet wrote an earlier <a
href="/Articles/648400/">article</a> on Greybus;
readers may want to look at that to catch up on some history.</p>

<h4>UniPro and the internals of the Greybus subsystem</h4>

<p>The Project Ara smartphone was designed to be customizable. The user could
select a subset from a wide range of modules, providing
interesting capabilities (like cameras, speakers, batteries, displays,
sensors, etc.), and attach them to the frame of the phone. The modules could
communicate with the main processors or other modules directly over the <a
href="http://mipi.org/specifications/unipro-specifications">UniPro</a>
bus. The specification of this bus is managed by the <a
href="http://mipi.org/">MIPI</a> alliance. UniPro follows the architecture
of the classical OSI network model, except that it has no application layer
defined.  And that's where Greybus fits in.

<p>UniPro communication happens over bidirectional connections between
entities, like the modules on the Ara smartphone; it doesn't need to
go through the processors.  Each UniPro device has virtual ports within it,
which can be seen as sub-addresses within the device. They are a lot like
sockets and are called "connection ports" (or CPorts). There
is a switch on the bus that sets up the actual routes. Messages can pass at
a rate of around 10Gb/s; the bus also has message prioritization, error
handling, and notification of delivery problems, though UniPro
doesn't support streams or multicast delivery.</p>

<p>As the Greybus specification was initially written for the Project Ara
smartphone, it is greatly inspired by Ara's design, where modules can
be inserted into or removed from the phone's frame on the fly. A lot
of effort has been put in to make the specification as generic as possible,
in order to make it fit for other use cases as well. You will also notice a
lot of similarities with the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">USB</a> framework in the Linux
kernel, as it was taken as a reference during the development of
Greybus.</p>

<p>The Greybus specification provides device discovery and description at
runtime, network routing and housekeeping, and class and bridged PHY
protocols, which devices use to talk to each other and to the processors.
The following figure gives a glimpse of how various parts of the kernel
interact with the Greybus subsystem.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/greybus.png" alt="[Greybus diagram]">
</blockquote>
<p>The Greybus core implements the supervisory controller (SVC) protocol
(described later), which is 
used by the application processor (AP â€” the CPUs running Linux) to
communicate to the 
SVC. The SVC represents an entity
within the Greybus network that configures and controls the Greybus
(UniPro) network, mostly based on the instructions from the AP. All module
insertion and removal events are first reported to the SVC, which in turn
informs the AP about them using the SVC protocol. The AP is responsible for
administrating the Greybus network via the SVC.</p>

<p>During initial development of the Ara smartphone, there were no SoCs
available with built-in UniPro support. Separate hardware entities were
designed to connect the AP to the UniPro network. These entities receive a
message from AP which they translate and send to the UniPro
network. The same was also required in the other direction: receive
messages from UniPro and translate them to the AP. These entities are
called as AP Bridge (APB) host controllers.  They can
receive messages over USB and send them over UniPro and vice versa. The AP
isn't part of the Greybus network really and so isn't
represented in the above picture.  The Greybus subsystem
also supports processors with built-in UniPro support; they are represented by
native UniPro host controllers. The AP can talk directly to
them without the USB subsystem.</p>

<p>During module initialization (after the module is detected on Greybus),
the Greybus core parses the module's manifest, which
describes the capabilities of the module, and creates
devices within the kernel to represent it.</p>

<p>Power management for the whole UniPro network (i.e. AP,
SVC, and modules) is managed by the Greybus core. During system suspend, the
Greybus core puts the SVC and the modules into low-power states and, on system
resume, it brings up the Greybus network. The Greybus core also performs
runtime power management for all individual entities. For example, if a module
isn't being used, the Greybus core will power it off and
will bring it back only when it is required.</p>

<p>The Greybus core also binds itself to the Linux kernel driver core and
provides a sysfs interface at <tt>/sys/bus/greybus</tt>. The following
diagram depicts the sysfs 
hierarchy for a single AP Bridge (APB) connected to the AP. A single module
is accessible via the APB and the module presents a single interface that
contains two bundles (devices) within it. The figure also represents the control
CPort per interface and the SVC per APB, along with a list of attributes
for each entity. All of these entities will be described later in
detail.</p>

<p>The
functionality provided by the modules is exposed using device-class and
bridged PHY drivers. The device-class drivers implement
protocols whose purpose is to provide a device abstraction for the
functionality commonly found on the mobile handsets. For example, cameras,
batteries, sensors, etc. The bridged PHY drivers, instead, implement
protocols whose purpose is to support communication with the modules on the
Greybus network that do not comply with a device-class protocol; these
include integrated circuits using alternative physical interfaces to
UniPro. For example, devices connected via  GPIO, I2C, SPI, USB, etc. The
modules that only
implement device-class protocols are said to be device-class conformant.
Modules that implement any of the bridged PHY protocols are said to be
non-device-class conformant. The device classes and bridged PHY protocols
will be listed later.</p>

<h4>Module hierarchy</h4>

<p>A module is the physical hardware entity that can be
connected or disconnected statically (before powering the system on) or
dynamically (while the system is running) from the Greybus network. Once
the modules are connected to the Greybus network, the AP and the SVC
enumerate the modules and fetch per-interface manifests to learn about their
capabilities.
The following figure gives a glimpse of how the module hierarchy looks
 in the Greybus subsystem:</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/greybus-modules.png" alt="Module hierarchy">
</blockquote>

<p>Modules are represented within the Linux kernel by a <tt>struct
gb_module</tt>:</p> 

<blockquote>
<pre>struct gb_module {
    struct device dev;
    u8 module_id;
    size_t num_interfaces;
    struct gb_interface *interfaces[0];
    ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>dev</tt> is the module's device structure,
<tt>module_id</tt> is a unique eight-bit number assigned to the module
by the SVC, <tt>interfaces</tt> points to the interfaces present within
the module, and <tt>num_interfaces</tt> is their count.</p>

<p>The Greybus modules have electrical connectors on them, connecting
them to the phone's frame. These electrical connectors are called
"interface blocks" and are represented in software by the term
"interface". A module can have one or more interfaces. The
interface with the smallest interface ID is configured as the primary
interface and all other are called secondary interfaces. The
<tt>module_id</tt> is set to the ID of the primary interface.
<p>
The
primary interface is special as the AP receives module insertion event with
the ID of the primary interface and the module can only be ejected from the
frame using the primary interface. The interfaces can present any
number of functionalities, which can be
supported with the bandwidth available to the respective interface
block. The interfaces are represented within the Linux kernel by the
<tt>struct gb_interface</tt>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>struct gb_interface {
    struct device dev;
    struct gb_control *control;
    struct list_head bundles;
    struct list_head manifest_descs;
    u8 interface_id;
    struct gb_module *module;
    ...
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>dev</tt> is the interface's device structure,
<tt>control</tt> represents the control connection (described
below), <tt>bundles</tt> is the list containing bundles within the
interface, <tt>manifest_descs</tt> is the lists of descriptors
created from the interface manifest, <tt>interface_id</tt> is the
unique ID of the interface, and <tt>module</tt> is the pointer to
the parent module structure.  The module ID and interface ID both start
from  zero and are unique within the Greybus network.</p>

<p>The Greybus Interfaces can contain one or more
bundles, each of which represents a logical Greybus device
in the kernel. For example, an interface with vibrator and battery
functionalities will have two bundles, one for the vibrator and one
for the battery. Each bundle will get a <tt>struct
device</tt> for itself and a greybus driver will bind to that
device. The bundle ID is unique within an interface. The bundles are
represented within the Linux kernel by the 
<tt>struct gb_bundle</tt>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
struct gb_bundle {
    struct device           dev;
    struct gb_interface     *intf;
    u8                      id;
    u8                      class;
    size_t                  num_cports;
    struct list_head        connections;
    ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>dev</tt> is the bundle's device structure,
<tt>intf</tt> is the pointer to the parent interface,
<tt>id</tt> is the unique ID of the bundle within the interface,
<tt>class</tt> is the class type of the bundle (like, camera or
audio), <tt>connections</tt> is the connections within the bundle,
and <tt>num_cports</tt> is the count of the connections.</p>

<p>The Greybus driver is represented by the following structure and it
accepts the bundle structure as argument to all its callbacks:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
struct greybus_driver {
    const char *name;
    int (*probe)(struct gb_bundle *bundle,
                 const struct greybus_bundle_id *id);
    void (*disconnect)(struct gb_bundle *bundle);
    const struct greybus_bundle_id *id_table;
    struct device_driver driver;
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>name</tt> is the name of the Greybus driver,
<tt>probe</tt> and <tt>disconnect</tt> are the callbacks,
<tt>id_table</tt> is the device bundle ID table, and
<tt>driver</tt> is the generic device driver structure.</p>

<p>The Greybus or UniPro "connection" is a bidirectional
communication path between two CPorts. There can be one or more CPorts
within a bundle. The communication over the connections is governed by a
predefined set of operations and the semantics of those operations is
defined by the Greybus protocols (covered later).  Each CPort is managed by
exactly one protocol. The CPort numbers are unique within an interface. The
first CPort within the interface is always the control CPort (CPort0, which
is not part of
any bundle) while the rest of the CPorts are numbered starting with one.
CPort0 is special and is used for the
management of its interface. It is governed by a
special protocol, the control protocol (described later). The connections are
represented within Linux kernel by the <tt>struct
gb_connection</tt>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
struct gb_connection {
    struct gb_host_device           *hd;
    struct gb_interface             *intf;
    struct gb_bundle                *bundle;
    u16                             hd_cport_id;
    u16                             intf_cport_id;
    struct list_head                operations;
    ...
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>hd</tt> represents the AP bridge through which the AP
communicates with the module, <tt>intf</tt> represents the parent
interface, <tt>bundle</tt> represents the parent bundle,
<tt>hd_cport_id</tt> represents the CPort ID of the AP bridge,
<tt>intf_cport_id</tt> represents the CPort ID of the interface,
and <tt>operations</tt> is the list of operations that are getting
exchanged over the connection. The connection is established between
<tt>hd_cport_id</tt> and <tt>intf_cport_id</tt>.</p>

<p>Greybus bundles can also represent complex functionalities, such as
audio or camera. Normally, such complex devices consist of multiple
components working together, like sensors, DMA controllers, bridges, audio
interfaces, codecs, etc., 
and a single bundle device may look insufficient to represent them all. But
that's how Greybus represents such devices. The module side contains
the firmware that makes all these components work together; it
takes inputs from the AP over the connections present
within the bundle. For example, a bundle representing the camera will have
two connections: data and management. All management instructions are sent
to the module or configurations are received from the module using the
management connection. And the data from the camera on the module is
received over the data connection. The internals of how various components
work together to represent the camera are hidden from Greybus and hence the
AP.</p>

<p>When a module and its interfaces are connected to the Greybus network
(by attaching the module to the frame of the phone), the AP starts
enumerating its interfaces over CPort0. The AP fetches a block of data
from the interfaces, called the interface manifest. The
manifest is a data structure containing the manifest header along with a
set of descriptors. The manifest allows the AP to learn about the
capabilities of the interface.</p>

<p>Following is a simple example of a raw manifest file that represents an
interface that supports a single audio bundle. The
manifest file is converted into a binary blob using the <a
href="https://github.com/projectara/manifesto">Manifesto library</a>. In
the following example, the bundle has two connections: "Management" and
"Data". Note that it is optional to add the control CPort0 in the manifest
file.</p>
<blockquote>

</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Greybus messages</h4>

<p>Greybus communication is built on UniPro messages, which are used to
exchange information between the AP, SVC, and the modules. Normally all
communication is bidirectional, in that for every request message from a sender,
the receiver responds with a response message. Which entity (AP, SVC, or the
module) can initiate a request message depends on the individual operation
as defined by the respective protocol. For example, only the AP can
initiate operations on the control protocol. Some of the operations are
unidirectional operations as well, where the receiver doesn't need to
generate a response message.</p>

<p>Each message sent over UniPro begins with a short header,
followed by operation-specific payload data. The message header is
represented by following structure:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
struct gb_operation_msg_hdr {
    __le16  size;           /* Size in bytes of header + payload */
    __le16  operation_id;   /* Operation unique id */
    __u8    type;           /* E.g GB_I2C_TYPE_TRANSFER */
    __u8    result;         /* Result of request (in responses only) */

</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>size</tt> is the size of the header (8 bytes) plus
size of the payload data.  The size of payload data is defined by each
operation of every protocol.
The <tt>operation_id</tt> is a unique, 16-bit number which is
used to match request and response messages. The <tt>operation_id</tt>
allows many 
operations to be "in flight" on a connection at once. The special ID zero is
reserved for unidirectional operations.

The operation <tt>type</tt> is an eight-bit number that defines the
type of the operation.  The meaning of the type value depends on the
protocol in use. Only 127 operations
are available for a given protocol (0x01..0x7f); operation 0x00 is
reserved. The most significant bit (0x80) of the operation type is used as a
flag that distinguishes a request message from its response. For requests,
this bit is zero, for responses, it is one.
The <tt>result</tt> field is ignored for request messages;
it contains the result of the requested operation in the response
message.</p>

<p>Greybus messages (both request and response) are managed using the
following structure within the Linux kernel:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
struct gb_message {
    struct gb_operation             *operation;
    struct gb_operation_msg_hdr     *header;
    void                            *payload;
    size_t                          payload_size;
    ...
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>operation</tt> is the operation to which the message
belongs, <tt>header</tt> is the header to be sent over UniPro,
<tt>payload</tt> is the payload to be sent following the header, and
<tt>payload_size</tt> is the size of the payload.</p>

<p>An entire Greybus operation (a request  and its response) is managed
using the following structure within the Linux kernel:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
struct gb_operation {
    struct gb_connection    *connection;
    struct gb_message       *request;
    struct gb_message       *response;
    u8                      type;
    u16                     id;
    ...
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>connection</tt> represents the communication path over
which UniPro messages are sent, <tt>request</tt> and
<tt>response</tt> represent the Greybus messages, and
<tt>type</tt> and <tt>id</tt> are as described earlier in
the message header.</p>

<p>There are multiple helpers which can be used to send/receive Greybus
messages over a connection, but most of the users end up using the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
int gb_operation_sync_timeout(struct gb_connection *connection, int type,
                              void *request, int request_size, void *response,
                              int response_size, unsigned int timeout);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <tt>connection</tt> represents the communication path over
which UniPro messages are sent, <tt>type</tt> is the operation
type, <tt>request</tt> is the request payload,
<tt>request_size</tt> is the size of the request payload,
<tt>response</tt> is the space for response payload,
<tt>response_size</tt> is the size of the expected response
payload, and <tt>timeout</tt> is the timeout period for the
operation in milliseconds. Usually, a timeout of 1ms is chosen.</p>

<p><tt>gb_operation_sync_timeout()</tt> creates the operation and its
messages, copies the request payload into the request message, and 
sends the request message header and its payload over the Greybus
connection. It then waits for <tt>timeout</tt> milliseconds for a response from
the other side and errors out if no response is received within that
time. Otherwise, once the response is received, it first checks the
response header to check the result of the operation. If result field
indicates an error, then <tt>gb_operation_sync_timeout()</tt> errors
out. Otherwise,
it copies the response payload into the memory pointed by the <tt>response</tt>
field and destroys the operation and message structures. It returns zero
on success or a negative number to represent errors.</p>

<h4>Greybus protocols</h4>

<p>The Greybus protocols define the layout and semantics of
messages that are exchanged over a Greybus connection. Each Greybus
protocol defines a set of operations, with formats of their request and
response messages. It also defines which side of the connection can
initiate each request. The Greybus
protocols are broadly divided into three categories: special protocols,
device-class protocols, and bridged PHY protocols.</p>

<p>The special protocols are the core Greybus protocols
with administrative powers over the Greybus network. There are two special
protocols: SVC and Control.</p>

<p>The SVC protocol serves the purpose of communication
between the AP and the SVC. The AP controls the network via the SVC using
this protocol. The CPort0 of the APB is used for the SVC connection
(don't confuse that with the CPort0 of each module interface which is
used for the control protocol). The main purpose of this protocol is to help
the AP create routes between various CPorts, sense module insertion or
removal, etc. The modules on the Greybus network should not implement
it.  Operations defined under this protocol include module insertion and
removal events, the creation and destruction of routes and connections, and
more. 

<p>The control protocol serves the purpose of
communication between the AP and the module's interfaces. The AP
controls individual interfaces using this protocol. The main purpose of
this protocol is to help the AP enumerate a new interface and learn about
its capabilities. Only the AP can initiate operations (send requests) under
this protocol and the module must respond to those requests. Some of
the operations allowed under this protocol can get an interface's manifest,
or activate, deactivate, suspend, or resume a bundle.

<p>As mentioned earlier, the device-class protocols
provide a device abstraction for the functionality commonly found on mobile
handsets. A simple example of that can be the audio management protocol or
the camera management protocol.  The bridged PHY protocols provide
communication with 
the modules on the Greybus network that do not comply with an existing
device class protocol, and which include integrated circuits using
alternative physical interfaces to UniPro.

<h4>What's next</h4>
<p>
It would be interesting to do a couple of things going forward. To begin
with, the 
Greybus core should be moved from the staging tree to the kernel's
<tt>drivers</tt> 
directory.  The drivers themselves should be moved to their respective
frameworks: 
<tt>.../greybus/gpio.c</tt> would become <tt>.../gpio/gpio-greybus.c</tt>,
for example. This would take reasonable amount of time and effort.
<p>
Later on, it would be nice to get Motorola's Moto Mods support merged into the
kernel and include its improvements to the Greybus subsystem. That will mostly
depend on the Motorola community, though. As Project Ara is
discontinued now, it would be quite interesting to find new targets (like the
Internet of things) for the Greybus subsystem and adapt Greybus to support them.
Some discussions are going on about that.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

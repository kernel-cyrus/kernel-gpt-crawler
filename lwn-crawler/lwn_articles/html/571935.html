Sarah Sharp led a session to update the group on the status of the Outreach
Program for Women (OPW) and the kernel.  The kernel project has just
completed its first round of participation in this program, which funds
three-month internships for women looking to work with a free software
project.  OPW runs internships twice each year, in the June-to-September
and December-to-March time frames.  There is a month-long application
process prior to the beginning of each period, during which prospective
participants much contact a mentor, submit a contribution to the target
project, and get it accepted.  
<p>
In the first round, the kernel applicants mostly sent patches for the
staging tree; the result was 93 patches in the 3.12 kernel and <a
href="http://kernelnewbies.org/OPWIntro">a tutorial</a> on how to
participate in the program.  It was, Sarah said, a successful beginning.
<p>
For those who want to help, the project is always in need of mentors for
participants.  Also needed are people who can hang out on the OPW IRC
channel and answer basic questions as they come up, and "patient people"
who can do pre-posting review of patches.
<p>
Dave Airlie asked how OPW projects were picked.  The answer is that it
starts with the mentors, who generally have specific areas in which they
are comfortable helping new developers.  After that, it's up to the
applicants to suggest specific projects they would like to work on.  In
general, the most successful projects seem to be those that do not require
a lot of subsystem-specific knowledge.
<p>
What is expected of mentors?  Sarah said that the way she worked was to
have weekly phone meetings with her intern, and that she spent three or
four hours per week looking at patches, responding to questions, etc.  All
told, she said, it is a commitment of about eight hours per week.
<p>
Returning to how the kernel's first OPW experience went: for the most part,
the participants "did pretty well."  A couple of them have not yet
completed their projects, but they are still working on them.  At least six

of them are looking for work in the kernel area.  It was "pretty
successful" overall.  James Bottomley asked whether any of the interns are
thinking about turning around and taking a turn as mentors; Sarah answered
that some of them are helping out on the IRC channel, but none of them are
ready to be full mentors yet.
<p>
Linus raised a general concern he had which, he said, had little to do with
OPW specifically; it's something he has seen in other groups.  There were,
he said, a lot of trivial one-line patches from the OPW participants; the
same fix applied to ten files showed up as ten separate patches.  It makes
the numbers look good, he said, but is not necessarily helpful otherwise.
He is worried about people gaming the system to look good by having a lot
of commits; Arnd Bergmann agreed that splitting things into too many
patches tends to impede review.  
<p>
From there, the conversation became a bit more unfocused.  Ted Ts'o
suggested that mentoring could be a good recruiting tool for companies that
are forever struggling to hire enough kernel developers.  There were
complaints that three months is too short a period for an intern to really
dig deeply into the kernel; it is, it was suggested, driven a little too
much by the American university schedule.  Dave added that universities in
other parts of the world will often place students into this kind of
project for longer periods.  Mauro Carvalho Chehab suggested that it would
be good to place a greater emphasis on places like Africa and South America
where we have few developers now; Sarah agreed that interns can come from
anywhere, we simply are not advertising well enough in those areas.
<p>
Ted asked what the limiting factor for the program was; funding seems to be
the biggest issue.  That will be especially true during the next cycle,
when the Linux Foundation, which funded several interns the first time
around, will not be able to participate.  There is a need for more
employers to kick in to support interns; the cost for one participant in
$5,750.  <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/OPWSponsor">Information on how
to sponsor OPW interns</a> has been posted on the KernelNewbies site.

We (Bloomberg) sponsored 5 OPW interns in the Summer 2013 cycle, and we plan to continue sponsoring at that level. If there are specific kernel projects/mentors that are looking for sponsorship, reach out to me (kpfleming at bloomberg.net) and we'll see if we can help.<br>

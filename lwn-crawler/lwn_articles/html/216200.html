<h1>Asynchronous buffered file I/O</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 3, 2007 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
Asynchronous I/O (AIO) operations have the property of not blocking in the
kernel.  If an operation cannot be completed immediately, it is set in
motion and control returns to the calling application while things are
still in progress.  This functionality allows a suitably-programmed
application to keep multiple operations going in parallel without blocking
on any of them.
<p>
While Linux has long offered a set of system calls for asynchronous I/O,
support within the kernel has been spotty and slow in coming.  Most char
devices do not provide the necessary methods - generally because there is
no pressing need for them to support asynchronous operations.  Networking
supports AIO reasonably well.  At the block level, all I/O is asynchronous,
but that is not true when dealing with the virtual filesystem layer.  Quite
a bit of work went into supporting asynchronous direct filesystem I/O,
making the big database vendors happy.  But most applications do not use
direct I/O, and the system as a whole usually benefits from the use of
buffered I/O.  So asynchronous buffered I/O support is arguably the biggest
remaining hole.
<p>

Various buffered filesystem AIO patches have been posted over the course of
some three years, but none have made it into the kernel.  Recently, Suparna
Bhattacharya has restarted this work with <a href="/Articles/216202/">a new
file AIO patch</a> which attempts to add this capability in the least
intrusive way possible.  This work may now be simple enough that few will
be able to find things to object to.
<p>

Like previous versions of the patch, the current code adds a special wait
queue to each process's task structure.  That queue is used for normal
synchronous operations, while asynchronous operations each have their own,
dedicated queue.  The current wait queue is passed into filesystem I/O
operations which could block.  That enables a couple of special tricks to be
performed:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The I/O wait code checks to see if an asynchronous wait queue is 
     in use.  If so, it simply returns <tt>-EIOCBRETRY</tt> rather than
     waiting.  This return code indicates that the operation is still in
     progress; among other things, it is used to ensure that the wait queue
     entry remains on the queue until the operation completes.
<p>
<li> Normally, wait queues wake up whatever process is waiting on them.
     They are, however, rather more general than that.  By changing the
     wakeup function (see <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/22913/">this LWN
     article</a> for information on how to do that), the AIO code can use
     wait queues as notification service.  When a "wakeup"
     happens on a queue being used for AIO, the kernel, rather than waking
     up a process, starts up a workqueue with an entry that will take the
     next step in the I/O operation.
</ul>
<p>
The normal buffered filesystem read code, simplified almost into oblivion,
looks something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    for each file page to be read
	get the page into the page cache
	copy the contents to the user buffer
</pre>
<p>
The real code can be found in <tt>mm/filemap.c</tt> as
<tt>do_generic_mapping_read()</tt>, but the leading comment notes that
"<q>this is really ugly</q>".  It is one of only three functions so
marked in that file, so, trust your editor, and go with the simple version
above.
<p>
In the pseudocode version, the place where things block is clearly the step
where the file page is read into the page cache.  If the page is not
already cached, the kernel will have to set up a disk I/O operation and
wait for it to be carried out.  That code proceeds the way it always did,
until it gets to the "wait" part, at which point the AIO wait queue will be
noticed and the code will return to whatever it was doing before.  Once the
read completes, the special wakeup function associated with the AIO queue
will pick up where things left off.
<p>
One might well wonder just how that "pick up" part works.  The wakeup
function will not be running in the process of the original calling
application, and may well not be running in process context at all.  So it
queues up a workqueue function which will examine the state of the
outstanding I/O operation and, if necessary, jump back into the loop above
to continue the work.  Before doing so, however, the workqueue function
carefully tweaks its memory management context so that it shares the
original application's address space.  That tweak is necessary to make the
final line above (copy the page to the user buffer) work as expected.  The
workqueue function will perform that copy, then proceed on to the next page
(if any).  Likely as not, that next page will need to be read in from disk,
so the workqueue function will, after ensuring that the operation is
started, simply quit.  This process repeats until all of the requested data
has been read, at which point the application can be notified that the
operation is complete.
<p>
On the write side, one might think that no changes are required - buffered
file writes are already asynchronous, with the flush to disk happening in
the background.  The exception, however, is when <tt>O_SYNC</tt> is in
use.  There are situations where applications want to know when the data
has found its way to the disk platter, but they still don't want to block
waiting for that to happen.  A very similar approach is used to make
asynchronous <tt>O_SYNC</tt> writes work, though the patch is a little
larger.  A couple of the low-level page writeback functions required
modifications so that they would pass the relevant wait queue around.  
<p>

Even with this change in place, writes can still block on occasion.  In
particular, any operation which requires allocating disk blocks for the
file may block while those allocations are performed.  This issue can
probably be worked around, but that work has not yet been done.
<p>

The result of all this is a working asynchronous buffered file I/O
capability which makes almost no changes to (and adds little overhead to)
the "normal" synchronous code.  If no serious objections are raised, the
Linux AIO subsystem might just become a little more complete in the near
future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <P>Some operating systems from nearly thirty years ago were already providing this feature, in a very simple way: decouple I/O from process scheduling. This way, there is no distinction between "synchronous" and "asynchronous" I/O in the kernel at all--as far as the kernel is concerned, all I/O operations are asynchronous.

<P>Instead, the distinction is implemented entirely in userspace. The synchronous versions of the I/O calls actually make two kernel calls: "request I/O operation" followed by "wait for completion". No need for special paths through the kernel for handling synchronous versus asynchronous kinds of I/O operations.

      The problem is that the vast majority of all I/O ops are synchronous, so needing multiple syscalls for them is unnecessary overhead. (You might think `who cares, the I/O will dominate', but it may not with e.g. fast network cards).<br>
<p>
Plus, synchronous I/O was there first (I suspect this is the *real* reason why it gets syscalls of its own).<br>

      <P>The extra overhead didn't matter for low-performance applications.

<P>The high-performance applications tended to be written to use <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_system_trap">AST</A>s to report I/O completion.

      you write:
<blockquote>Networking supports AIO reasonably well.</blockquote>
That might be true for TCP, but AFAICS there's no api that lets us use UDP with asynchroneous I/O. The problem is that, besides the actual data, address information has to be passed on send and receive, and the aio_* API does not allow that information to be passed.

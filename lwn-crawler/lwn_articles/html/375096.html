<h1>Huge pages part 2: Interfaces</h1>
</div>

In an ideal world, the operating system would automatically use huge pages
where appropriate, but there are a few problems.  First, the operating system
must decide when it is appropriate to promote base pages to huge pages
requiring the maintenance of metadata which, itself, has an associated cost
which may or may not be offset by the use of huge pages. Second, there
can be architectural limitations that prevent a different page size being
used within an address range once one page has been inserted. Finally,
differences in TLB structure make predicting how many huge pages can be
used and still be of benefit problematic.
<p>
For these reasons, with one notable exception, operating systems provide a
more explicit interface for huge pages to user space. It is up to application
developers and system administrators to decide how they best be used. This
chapter will cover the interfaces that exist for Linux.

<h3>1 Shared Memory</h3>
<p>
One of the oldest interfaces backs shared memory segments created by
<tt>shmget()</tt> with huge pages.  Today, it is commonly used due to its
simplicity and the length of time it has been supported. Huge pages are
requested by specifying the <tt>SHM_HUGETLB</tt> flag and ensuring the
<tt>size</tt> is huge-page-aligned. Examples of how to do this are included
in the kernel source tree under <a
href="/Articles/375098/"><tt>Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt</tt></a>.
<p>

A limitation of this interface is that only the default huge page size
(as indicated by the <tt>Hugepagesize</tt> field in
<tt>/proc/meminfo</tt>) will be used. If one wanted to use 16GB pages as supported on
later versions of POWER for example, the <tt>default_hugepagesz=</tt>
field must be used on the kernel command line as documented in
<tt>Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt</tt> in the kernel source.
<p>
The maximum amount of memory that can be committed to shared-memory huge
pages is controlled 
by the <tt>shmmax</tt> sysctl parameter. This parameter will be discussed
further  in the next installment.

<a name="hugetlbfs"></a>
<h3>2 HugeTLBFS</h3>
<p>
For the creation of shared or private mappings, Linux provides a RAM-based
filesystem called "hugetlbfs." Every file on this filesystem is
backed by huge pages and is accessed with <tt>mmap()</tt> or <tt>read()</tt>.
If no options are specified at mount time, the default huge page size
is used to back the files.  To use a different page size, specify 
<tt>pagesize=</tt>.
<p>
<pre>
    $ mount -t hugetlbfs none /mnt/hugetlbfs -o pagesize=64K
</pre>
<p>

There are two ways to control the amount of memory which can be consumed by
huge pages attached to a mount point.  The <tt>size=</tt> mount parameter
specifies (in bytes; the "K," "M," and 
"G" suffixes are understood) the maximum amount of memory which will be used 
by this mount. The size is rounded down to the nearest huge page size. It
can also be specified as a percentage of the static huge page pool, though
this option appears to be rarely used. The <tt>nr_inodes=</tt> parameter
limits the 
number of files that can exist on the mount point which, in effect, limits the
number of possible mappings. In combination, these options can be used to
divvy up the available huge pages to groups or users in a shared system.

<p>
Hugetlbfs is a bare interface to the huge page capabilities of the underlying
hardware; taking advantage of it requires application awareness or library
support.  Libhugetlbfs makes heavy use of this
interface when automatically backing regions with huge pages.
<p>
For an application wishing to use the interface, the initial step is
to discover the mount point by either reading <tt>/proc/mounts</tt>
or using libhugetlbfs. Finding the mount point manually is
relatively straightforward and already well known for <tt>debugfs</tt>
but, for completeness, a very simple example program is shown below:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/param.h&gt;

char *find_hugetlbfs(char *fsmount, int len)
{
	char format[256];
	char fstype[256];
	char *ret = NULL;
	FILE *fd;

	snprintf(format, 255, "%%*s %%%ds %%255s %%*s %%*d %%*d", len);

	fd = fopen("/proc/mounts", "r");
	if (!fd) {
		perror("fopen");
		return NULL;
	}

	while (fscanf(fd, format, fsmount, fstype) == 2) {
		if (!strcmp(fstype, "hugetlbfs")) {
			ret = fsmount;
			break;
		}
	}

	fclose(fd);
	return ret;
}

int main() {
	char buffer[PATH_MAX+1];
	printf("hugetlbfs mounted at %s\n", find_hugetlbfs(buffer, PATH_MAX));
	return 0;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

When there are multiple mount points (to make different page sizes
available), it gets more complicated; libhugetlbfs also provides a number
of functions to help with these mount
points. <tt>hugetlbfs_find_path()</tt> returns a mount point similar 
to the example program above, while <tt>hugetlbfs_find_path_for_size()</tt>
will return a mount point for a specific huge page size. If the developer
wishes to test a particular path to see if it <tt>hugetlbfs</tt> or not,
use <tt>hugetlbfs_test_path()</tt>.
<p>
<h3>3 Anonymous mmap()</h3>
<p>
As of kernel <tt>2.6.32</tt>, support is available that allows anonymous
mappings to be created backed by huge pages with <tt>mmap()</tt> by specifying
the flags <tt>MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_HUGETLB</tt>. These mappings
can be private or shared.
It is somewhat of an oversight that the amount of memory that can be pinned
for anonymous <tt>mmap()</tt> is limited only by huge page availability.
This potential problem may be addressed in future kernel releases.
<p>
<h3>4 libhugetlbfs Allocation APIs</h3>
<p>
It is recognised that a number of applications want to simply get a buffer
backed by huge pages. To facilitate this, libhugetlbfs
provides two APIs since release 2.0, <tt>get_hugepage_region()</tt>
and <tt>get_huge_pages()</tt> with corresponding free functions called
<tt>free_hugepage_region()</tt> and <tt>free_huge_pages()</tt>. These are
all provided with manual pages distributed with the libhugetlbfs
package.
<p>
<tt>get_huge_pages()</tt> is intended for use with the development of
custom allocators and not as a drop-in replacement for <tt>malloc()</tt>.
It is required that the size parameter to this API be hugepage-aligned
which can be discovered with the function <tt>gethugepagesize()</tt>.
<p>
If an application wants to allocate a number of very large buffers
but is not concerned with alignment or some wastage, it should use
<tt>get_hugepage_region()</tt>. The calling convention to this function
is much more relaxed and will optionally fallback to using small pages
if necessary.
<p>
It is possible that applications need very tight control
over how the mapping is placed in memory. If this is the case,
libhugetlbfs provides <tt>hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd()</tt> and
<tt>hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd_for_size()</tt> to create a file descriptor
representing an unlinked file on a suitable <tt>hugetlbfs</tt> mount
point.  Using the file-descriptor, the application can <tt>mmap()</tt>
with the appropriate parameters for accurate placement.
<p>

Converting existing applications and libraries to use the API where applicable
should be straightforward, but basic examples of how to do it with 
the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/">STREAM</a> memory
bandwidth benchmark suite are available&nbsp;[gorman09a].
<p>
<h3>5 Automatic Backing of Memory Regions</h3>

<p>
While applications can be modified to use any of the interfaces, it imposes a
significant burden on the application developer. To make life easier, libhugetlbfs can
back a number of memory region types automatically when it is either pre-linked or
pre-loaded. This process is described in the <tt>HOWTO</tt> documentation
and manual pages that come with libhugetlbfs.
<p>
Once loaded, libhugetlbfs's behaviour is determined by
environment variables described in the <tt>libhugetlbfs.7</tt>
manual page.  As manipulating environment variables is time-consuming
and error-prone, a <tt>hugectl</tt> utility exists that does much of
the configuring automatically and will output what steps it took if the
<tt>--dry-run</tt> switch is specified.
<p>

To determine if huge pages are really being used, <tt>/proc</tt> can be
examined, but libhugetlbfs will also warn if the verbosity is
set sufficiently high and sufficient numbers of huge pages are not
available. See below for an example of using a simple 
program that backs a 32MB segment with huge pages.  Note how the first
attempt to use huge pages failed and some configuration was required as no
huge pages were previously configured on this system.
<p>
The manual pages are quite comprehensive so this section will only give a
brief introduction as to how different sections of memory can be backed by
huge pages without modification.

<p>
<h4>5.1 Shared Memory</h4>
<p>
When libhugetlbfs is preloaded or linked and
the environment variable <tt>HUGETLB_SHM</tt> is set to
<tt>yes</tt>, libhugetlbfs will override all calls
to <tt>shmget()</tt>. Alternatively, launch the application with
<tt>hugectl $--$shm</tt>. On setup, all <tt>shmget()</tt> requests
will become aligned to a hugepage boundary and backed with huge pages if
possible. If the system configuration does not allow huge pages to be used,
the original request is honoured.
<p>
<h4>5.2 Heap</h4>

<p>
Glibc defines a <tt>__morecore</tt> hook that is is
called when the heap size needs to be increased; libhugetlbfs
uses this hook to create regions of memory backed by huge pages. Similar to
shared memory, base pages are used when huge pages are not available.
<p>
When libhugetlbfs is preloaded or linked and the environment
variable <tt>HUGETLB_MORECORE</tt> set to <tt>yes</tt>,
libhugetlbfs will configure the <tt>__morecore</tt>
hook, causing <tt>malloc()</tt> requests will use huge pages. Alternatively,
launch the application with <tt>hugectl&nbsp;--heap</tt>.
<p>
Unlike shared memory, the page size can also be specified if more than
one page size is supported by the system.  The first example below uses the
default page size (e.g. 16M on Power5+) and the second example explicitly
overrides a default, using 64K pages.
<p>
<pre>
    $ hugectl --heap ./target-application
    $ hugectl --heap=64k ./target-application
</pre>
<p>
If the application has already been linked with libhugetlbfs,
it may be necessary to specify <tt>--no-preload</tt> when using
<tt>--heap</tt> so that an attempt is not made to load the library twice.
<p>

By using the <tt>__morecore</tt> hook and setting the <tt>mallopt()</tt>
option <tt>M_MMAP_MAX</tt> to zero, libhugetlbfs prevents glibc from making
use of <tt>brk()</tt> to expand the heap.  An 
application that calls <tt>brk()</tt> directly will be using base pages.

<p>
If a custom memory allocator is being used, it must support the
<tt>__morecore</tt> hook to use huge pages. An alternative may be to
provide a wrapper around <tt>malloc()</tt> that called the real underlying
<tt>malloc()</tt> or <tt>get_hugepage_region()</tt> depending on the
size of the buffer. A heavy solution would be to provide a fully-fledged
implementation of <tt>malloc()</tt> with libhugetlbfs that
uses huge pages where appropriate, but this is currently unavailable due to
the lack of a demonstrable use case.
<p>
<h4>5.3 Text and Data</h4>
<p>
Backing text or data is more involved as the application should first
be relinked to align the sections to a huge page boundary. This
is accomplished by linking against libhugetlbfs and
specifying <tt>-Wl,--hugetlbfs-align</tt> -- assuming the version of
binutils installed is sufficiently recent. More information
on relinking applications is described in the libhugetlbfs
HOWTO. Once the application is relinked, as before control is with
environment variables or with <tt>hugectl</tt>.
<p>
<pre>
    $ hugectl --text --data --bss ./target-application
</pre>
<p>
When backing text or data by text, the relevant sections are copied to files on
the hugetlbfs filesystem and mapped with <tt>mmap()</tt>. The files
are then unlinked so that the memory is freed on application exit. If the
application is to be invoked multiple times, it is worth sharing that data by
specifying the <tt>--share-text</tt> switch. The consequence is that the
memory remains in use when the application exits and must be manually deleted.
<p>
If it is not possible to relink the application, it is possible to force the
loading of segments backed by huge pages by setting the environment variable
<tt>HUGETLB_FORCE_ELFMAP</tt> to <tt>yes</tt>. This is not the
preferred option as the method is not guaranteed to work. Segments must be
large enough to overlap with a huge page and on architectures with limitations on
where segments can be placed, it can be particularly problematic.
<p>
<h4>5.4 Stack</h4>
<p>
Currently, the stack cannot be backed by huge pages. Support was implemented
in the past but the vast majority of applications did not aggressively use
the stack. In many distributions, there are <tt>ulimits</tt> on the size
of the stack that are smaller than a huge page size. Upon investigation,
only the <tt>bwaves</tt> test from the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark benefited from
stacks being backed by huge pages and only then when using a commercial
compiler.  When compiled with <tt>gcc</tt>, there was no benefit, hence
support was dropped.
<p>
<h3>6 Summary</h3>
<p>
There are a small number of interfaces provided by Linux to access huge pages.
While cumbersome to develop applications against, there is a programming API
available with libhugetlbfs and it is possible to automatically
back segments of memory with huge pages without application modification.
In the next section, it will be discussed how the system should be tuned.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The article says:
<blockquote>If one wanted to use 16GB pages as supported on later versions of POWER for example</blockquote>
But surely it means 16MB ? 
<p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/375098/">hugetlbpage.txt</a> makes no mention of an arch with 16GB page sizes.

      No, you can actually have 16GB pages on recent power systems. See <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/whitepapers/multiple_page.html">here</a> for instance.

      I've collected a number of excellent huge page resources for mostly Linux, but also a few for Solaris, AIX, as well as its impact on architectures (AMD, Sparc) and software: Java, MySql, Oracle. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://zzzoot.blogspot.com/2009/02/java-mysql-increased-performance-with.html">http://zzzoot.blogspot.com/2009/02/java-mysql-increased-performance-with.html</a>

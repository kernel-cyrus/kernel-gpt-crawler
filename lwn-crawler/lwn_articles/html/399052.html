<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 11, 2010</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, some 6700 non-merge changesets have been accepted for
the 2.6.36 development cycle.  These changes bring a lot of fixes and a
number of new features, some of which have been in the works for some
time.  The most interesting changes since <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/398684/">last week's summary</a> are
summarized here.

<p>
User-visible changes include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The ext3 filesystem, once again, defaults to the (safer) "ordered"
     mode at mount time.  This reverses the change (to "writeback" mode)
     made in 2009, which was typically overridden by distributions.
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/391222/">out-of-memory killer has
     been rewritten</a>.  The practical result is that the system may
     choose different processes to kill in out-of-memory situations, and
     the user-space API for adjusting how attractive processes appear to
     the OOM killer has changed.
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/360955/">fanotify mechanism</a>
     has been merged.  Fanotify allows a user-space daemon to obtain
     notification of file operations and, perhaps, block access to specific
     files.  It is intended for use with malware scanning applications, but
     there are other potential uses (hierarchical storage management, for
     example) as well.
<p>
<li> There is a new system call for working with resource limits:
<p>
<pre>
    int prlimit64(pid_t pid, unsigned int resource, 
                  const struct rlimit64 *new_rlim, struct rlimit64 *old_rlim);
</pre>
<p>
     It is meant to (someday) replace <tt>setrlimit()</tt>; the differences
     include the ability to modify limits belonging to other processes and
     the ability to query and set a limit in a single operation.
<p>
<li> The TTY driver has gained support for the <tt>EXTPROC</tt> mode
     supported by BSD for the last 20 years or so.  This option was
     originally developed to
     facilitate telnet's "linemode", but it is useful for contemporary
     protocols as well.
<p>

<li> New drivers:
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <b>Processors and systems</b>: Ingenic JZ4740 SOC systems,
    	 Trapeze ITS GPR boards,
	 ifm PDM360NG boards,
	 Freescale P1022DS reference boards,
	 TQM mcp8xx-based boards,
	 TI TNETV107X-based systems,
	 OMAP4430-based PandaBoards,
	 NVIDIA Tegra-based systems, and
	 Tilera TILEPro and TILE64 processors (a whole new architecture).
    <p>

    <li> <b>Block</b>: 
    	 QLogic ISP82XX host adaptors,
	 AppliedMicro 460EX processor on-chip SATA controllers,
	 Samsung S3C/S5P board PATA controllers, and
	 Moorestown NAND Flash controllers.

    <p>
    <li> <b>Media</b>:
	 EasyCAP USB video adapters,
	 Softlogic 6x10 MPEG codec cards,
	 Winbond/Nuvoton NUC900-based audio controllers,
	 Cirrus Logic CS42L51 codecs,
	 Cirrus Logic EP93xx series audio devices,
	 Marvell Kirkwood I2S audio devices,
	 Ingenic JZ4740-based audio devices,
	 SmartQ board audio devices,
	 Wolfson Micro WM8741 codecs, and
	 Samsung S5P FIMC video postprocessors.
    <p>
    <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
    	 Silicon Image sil164 TMDS transmitters,
	 TI DSP bridge devices,
	 PCILynx TSB12LV21/A/B controllers (as a FireWire sniffer; the
    	 user-space side has also been added under tools/firewire),
	 Bosch Sensortec BMP085 digital pressure sensors,
	 ROHM BH1780GLI ambient light sensors,
	 Honeywell HMC6352 compasses,
	 Summit Microelectronics SMM665 six-channel active DC output
    	 controller/monitor devices,
	 JEDEC JC 42.4 compliant temperature sensors,
	 Intel Topcliff PCH DMA controllers,
	 Intel Moorestown DMAC1 and DMAC2 controllers,
	 Intel Moorestown MAX3110 and MAX3107 UARTs,
	 Intel Medfield UARTs,
	 Quatech SSU-100 USB serial ports, and
	 ARM Primecell SP805 watchdog timers.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The SCSI layer now supports runtime power management, but almost no
     work has been done (yet) to push that support down into individual
     drivers. 
<p>
<li> The MIPS architecture now has kprobes support.
<p>
<li> The KGDB debugger is now supported with the Microblaze architecture.
<p>
<li> There are a few new build-time configuration commands:
     <tt>listnewconfig</tt> outputs a list of new configuration options, 
     <tt>oldnoconfig</tt> sets all new configuration options to "no"
     without asking,
     <tt>alldefconfig</tt> sets all options to their default values, and
     <tt>savedefconfig</tt> writes a minimal configuration file in
     <tt>defconfig</tt>. (<a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/f0778c8c41001783d4074e34efc7d3e632d87ee3">This
     patch</a> adding the first two options above also introduces a new
     <tt>Whatevered-by:</tt> patch tag, with unknown semantics).
<p>
<li> There is a new <tt>scripts/coccinelle</tt> directory containing a
     number of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/315686/">Coccinelle</a>
     "semantic patches" which perform various useful checks.  They can be
     run with "<tt>make&nbsp;coccicheck</tt>".
<p>
<li> The kmemtrace ftrace plugin is gone; "perf kmem" should be used
     instead.  The ksym plugin has also been superseded by perf, and, thus,
     removed. 
<p>
<li> There is a new function for short, blocking delays:
<p>
<pre>
    void usleep_range(unsigned long min, unsigned long max);
</pre>
<p>
     This function will sleep (uninterruptibly) for a period between
     <tt>min</tt> and 
     <tt>max</tt> microseconds.  It is based on hrtimers, so the timing
     will be more precise than obtained with <tt>msleep()</tt>.
<p>
<li> The new <tt>IRQF_NO_SUSPEND</tt> flag for <tt>request_irq()</tt> will cause
     the interrupt line 
     not to be disabled during suspend; <tt>IRQF_TIMER</tt> can no longer
     be (mis)used for this purpose.
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/355700/">concurrency-managed
     workqueues</a> patch set has been merged, completely changing the way
     workqueues are implemented.  One immediate user-visible result will be
     that there should be far fewer kernel threads running on most systems.

     All users of the "slow work" API have been converted to
     concurrency-manged workqueues, so the slow work mechanism has been
     removed from the kernel.
<p>
<li> The cpuidle mechanism has been enhanced to allow for the set of
     available idle states to change over time.  Details can be found in <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/71abbbf856a0e70ca478782505c800891260ba84">this
     patch</a>. 
<p>
<li> The Blackfin architecture has gained dynamic ftrace support.
<p>
<li> There is a new <tt>super_operations</tt> method called
     <tt>evict_inode()</tt>; it handles all of the necessary work when an
     in-core inode is being removed.  It should be used instead of
     <tt>clear_inode()</tt> and <tt>delete_inode()</tt>.
<p>
<li> The inotify mechanism has been removed from inside the kernel; the
     fsnotify mechanism must be used instead.  (Of course, the user-space
     inotify interface is still supported).
<p>
<li> The Video4Linux2 layer has gained a new framework which simplifies the
     handling of controls; see <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/0996517cf8eaded69b8502c8f5abeb8cec62b6d4">this
     commit</a> and <a
     href="/Articles/399547/">Documentation/video4linux/v4l2-controls.txt</a>
     for details.
<p>
<li> The <tt>open()</tt> and <tt>release()</tt> functions in <tt>struct
     block_device_operations</tt> are now called without the big kernel
     lock held.  Additionally, the <tt>locked_ioctl()</tt> function has
     gone away; all block drivers must implement their own locking there as
     well. 
<p>
<li> The domain name resolution code has been pulled out of the CIFS
     filesystem and made generic.  It works by using the key mechanism to
     request DNS resolution from user space; see <a
     href="/Articles/399546/">Documentation/networking/dns-resolver.txt</a>
     for details.
</ul>
<p>

The merge window remains open as of this writing, so we may yet see more
interesting features merged for 2.6.36.  Watch this space next week for the

Actually, there's a bit more to -&gt;evict_inode() story: -&gt;drop_inode() has also changed.<br>
<p>
Current rules are pretty simple:<br>
<p>
1) -&gt;drop_inode() is called when we release the last reference to struct inode.  It tells us whether fs wants inode to be evicted (as opposed to retained in inode cache).  Doesn't do actual eviction (as it used to), just returns an int.  The normal policy is "if it's unhashed or has no links left, evict it now".  generic_drop_inode() does these checks.  NULL -&gt;drop_inode means that it'll be used.  generic_delete_inode() is "just evict it".  Or fs can set rules of its own; grep and you'll see.<br>
<p>
2) -&gt;delete_inode() and -&gt;clear_inode() are gone; -&gt;evict_inode() is called in all cases when inode (without in-core references to it) is about to be kicked out, no matter why that happens (-&gt;drop_inode() telling that it shouldn't be kept around, memory pressure, umount, etc.) It will be called exactly once per inode's lifetime.  Once it returns, inode is basically just a piece of memory about to be freed.<br>
<p>
3) -&gt;evict_inode() _must_ call end_writeback(inode) at some point.  At that point all async access from VFS (writeback, basically) will be completed and inode will be fs's to deal with.  That's what calls of clear_inode() in original -&gt;delete_inode() should turn into.  Don't dirty an inode past that point; it never worked to start with (writeback logics would've refused to trigger -&gt;write_inode() on such inodes) and now it'll be detected and whined about.<br>
<p>
4) kicking the pages out of page cache (== calling truncate_inode_pages()) is up to -&gt;evict_inode() instance; that was already the case for -&gt;delete_inode(), but not for -&gt;clear_inode().  Of course, if fs doesn't use page cache for that inode, it doesn't have to bother.  Other than that, -&gt;evict_inode() instance is basically a mix of old -&gt;clear_inode() and -&gt;delete_inode().  inodes with NULL -&gt;evict_inode() behave exactly as ones with NULL -&gt;delete_inode() and NULL -&gt;clear_inode() used to.<br>
<p>
That's it. Original was much more convoluted...<br>

      From <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/7/21/176">this thread</a>:
<pre>Ok, so now I know *why* that one filesystem got busted - I built a
kernel without CONFIG_EXT3_DEFAULTS_TO_ORDERED set and it got a
forced reboot (echo b > proc/sysrq-trigger). That'll teach me for
trying to reproduce bugs Andrew is tripping over with his config
files.
Quite frankly, data=writeback mode for ext3 is a dangerous,
dangerous configuration to run by default. IMO, it shouldn't be the
default. Patch below.</pre>
Jan's changelog:
<pre>
data=writeback mode is dangerous as it leads to higher data loss and stale data
exposure when systems crash. It should not be the default, especially when all
major distros ensure their ext3 filesystems default to ordered mode. Change the
default mode to the safer data=ordered mode, because we should be caring far
more about avoiding stale data exposure than performance.</pre>

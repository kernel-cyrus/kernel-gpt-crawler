<p>
Thomas Gleixner gets asked regularly about a "roadmap" for getting the
realtime Linux (aka PREEMPT_RT) patches into the mainline.  As readers of
LWN will know, it has been a multiple-year effort to move pieces of the
realtime patchset into the mainline&mdash;and one that has been <a
href="/Articles/313045/">predicted</a> to complete several times, though
not for a few years now.  Gleixner presented an update on the realtime
patches at this year's Embedded Linux Conference.  In the talk, he showed a
roadmap&mdash;of sorts&mdash;but more importantly described what is still
lurking in that tree, and what approach the realtime developers will be
taking to get those pieces into the mainline.


<a href="/Articles/440239/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/elc-gleixner-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=3 align="left"
width=86 height=125 alt="[Thomas Gleixner]">
</a>

<p>
Gleixner started out by listing the parts of the realtime tree that have
already made it into the mainline.  That includes high-resolution timers,
the mutex infrastructure, preemptible and hierarchical RCU, threaded
interrupt handlers, and more. Interrupt handlers can now be forced to run
as threads by using a kernel command line option. 
There have also been cleanups done in lots of
places to make it easier to bring in features from the realtime tree,
including cleaning up the locking namespace and infrastructure "<q>so
that sleeping 
spinlocks becomes a more moderate sized patch</q>", he said.
</p>

<h4>Missing pieces</h4>

<p>
What's left are the "<q>tough ones</q>" as all of the changes that
are "<q>halfway easy to do</q>" are already in the mainline. The next
piece that will likely appear is the <a
href="/Articles/436785/">preemptible mmu_gather</a> patches, which will
allow much of the memory management code to be preemptible.  Gleixner said
that it was hoped that code could make it into 2.6.39; that didn't happen,
but it should go in for 2.6.40.
</p>

<p>
Per-CPU data structures are a current problem that "<q>makes me scratch
my head a lot</q>", Gleixner said.  The whole idea is to keep the data
structures local to a particular CPU and avoid cache contention between
CPUs, which requires 
that any code modifying those data structures stay running on that CPU.  In
order to do that, the code disables preemption while modifying the per-CPU
data. If that code "<q>just did a little fiddling</q>" with
preemption disabled, it would not be a problem, but currently there are
often thousands of lines of code executed.  The realtime developers have
talked with the per-CPU folks and they "<q>see our pain</q>".  The
right solution is use inline functions to annotate the real atomic
accesses, so that the preemption-disabled window can be
reduced. "<q>Right now, there is a massive amount of code protected by
<tt>preempt_disable()</tt></q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
The next area that needs to be addressed is preemptible memory and page
allocators. Right now, the realtime tree uses SLAB because the others are
"<q>too hard to deal with</q>".  There has been talk about creating a
memory allocator specifically for the realtime tree, but some recent
developments in the SLUB allocator may have removed the need for that.
SLUB has been converted to be completely lockless for the fast path and
Christoph Lameter has promised to deal with the slow path, which is
"<q>good news</q>" for the realtime developers.  The page allocator
problem is "<q>not that hard to solve</q>", Gleixner said.  Some
developers have claimed that a fully preemptible, lockless page allocator
is possible, so he is not worried about that part.
</p>

<p>
Another area "<q>that we still have to twist our brain around</q>" is
software interrupts, he said.  Those currently disable preemption, but then
can be interrupted themselves, leading to unbounded latency.  One
possibility is to split up the software interrupts into different threads
and to wake them up when an interrupt is generated, whether it comes from
kernel or user space.  There are performance implications with that,
however, because there is a context switch associated with the interrupt.
There are some other "<q>nasty implications</q>" as well, because it
will be difficult to tune the priorities of the interrupt threads
correctly.  

<p>
Another possibility would be to add an argument to
<tt>local_bh_disable()</tt> that would indicate which software interrupts
should be held off. But cleaning up the whole tree to add those new
arguments is "<q>nothing I can do right now</q>", he said.  There are
tools to help with adding the argument itself, but figuring out which
software interrupts should be disabled is a much bigger task.
</p>

<p>
The "<q>last thing</q>" that is still pending in the realtime tree is
sleeping spinlocks.  That work is fairly straightforward he said, only
requiring adding one file and patching three others.  But that will only
come once the other problems have been solved, he said.
</p>

<h4>Mainline merging</h4>

<p>
So, when will the merge to mainline be finished?  That's a question
Gleixner and the other realtime developers have been hearing for seven
years or so.  The patchset is huge and "<q>very intrusive in many
ways</q>", he said.  It has been slowly getting into the mainline piece
by piece, but it will probably never be complete, because people keep
coming up with new features at roughly the same rate as things move into
the mainline. As always, Gleixner said, "<q>it will be done by the end
of next year</q>".
</p>

<p>
Gleixner used a 2010 <a href="/Articles/370998/">quote from Linus Torvalds</a> ("<q>The RT people have actually been pretty good at slipping their stuff in, 
in small increments, and always with good reasons for why they aren't 
crazy.</q>") to illustrate the approach taken by the realtime
developers. The realtime changes are slipped into "<q>nice Trojan
horses</q>" that are useful for more than just realtime.  Torvalds is
"<q>well aware that we are cheating, but he doesn't care</q>" because
the changes fix other problems as well. 
</p>

<p>
The realtime tree has been pinned to kernel 2.6.33 for some time now (with
2.6.33.9-rt having been released just prior to Gleixner's talk).  There are
plans to update to 2.6.38 soon.  There a several reasons why the realtime
tree is not updated very rapidly, starting with a lack of developer time.
The tree also requires a long stabilization phase, partly because
"<q>some of the bugs we find are very complex race conditions</q>",
and those bugs can have serious impacts on filesystems or other parts of the
kernel. Typically the problem is not fixing those kinds of bugs, but
finding them as they can be quite hard to reproduce.
</p>

<p>
Another problem is that because the realtime changes aren't in the
mainline Gleixner "<q>can't yell at people yet</q>" when they break
things.  Also, other upstream work and merging other code often takes
priority over work in the realtime tree.  But he is "<q>tired of
maintaining that thing out of tree</q>", so work will progress.  Often
getting a piece of the realtime tree accepted requires lots of work
elsewhere in the tree, which consumes a lot of time and brain power.
"<q>People ship crap faster than you can fix it</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
There are about 20 active contributors to the realtime tree, as well as
large testing efforts going on at Red Hat, IBM, OSADL, and Gleixner's
company Linutronix.
</p>

<p>
Looking beyond the current code, Gleixner outlined two potential future
features.  The first is non-priority-based scheduling, which is needed to
solve certain kinds of problems, but brings with it a whole new set of
problems.  Even though priorities are not used, there are still
"<q>priority-inversion-like problems</q>" that will have to be solved
with mechanisms similar to priority inheritance.  Academics have proved
that such schedulers can work on uni-processor systems, but have just now
started to "<q>understand that there is this thing called SMP</q>".
Though there is a group in Pisa, Italy (working on <a
href="/Articles/356576/">deadline scheduling</a>) that Gleixner specifically excluded
from his complaints about academic researchers.
</p>

<p>
The other new feature is CPU isolation, which is not exactly realtime work,
but the realtime 
developers have been asked to look into it.  The idea is to hand over a CPU
to a particular task, so that it gets the full use of that CPU.  In order
to do that, the CPU must be removed from the timer interrupt and the RCU
pool among other things.  The problem isn't so much that users want to be
able to run undisturbed for an hour on a CPU or core, but that they then
want to be able to interact with the rest of the kernel to send data over
the network or write to disk.  In general, it's fairly clear what needs to
be done to implement CPU isolation, he said.
</p>

<h4>Roadmap</h4>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2011/elc-rt-roadmap.png" border=0 hspace=3 align="right"
width=256 height=256 alt="[RT roadmap]">

<p>
It is obvious that Gleixner is tired of being asked for a roadmap for
the realtime patches.  Typically it isn't engineers working on devices or
other parts of the kernel who ask for it, but is, instead, their managers
who are looking for such a thing.  There are several reasons why there is
no roadmap, starting with the fact that kernel developers don't use
PowerPoint.  More seriously, though, the realtime developers are making
their own road into the kernel, so they are looking for a road to follow
themselves.  But, so that it could no longer be said that he hadn't shown a
roadmap, Gleixner presented one (shown at right) to much laughter.
</p>

<p>
He also fielded quite a few audience questions about the realtime tree,
what others can do to help it progress, and why some of the troublesome
Linux features couldn't be eliminated to make it easier to get the code
merged.  In terms of help, the biggest need is for more testing.  In
particular, Gleixner encouraged people to test the realtime patches atop
Greg Kroah-Hartman's 2.6.33 
stable series.
</p>

<p>
Software interrupts are still required in various places in the kernel, in
particular the network and block layers.  Any change to try to remove them
would require changes in too much code.  On the other hand, counting
semaphores are mostly gone, though some uses come in through the staging
tree.  Those are mostly cleaned up before the staging code moves out of
that tree, he said.  From time to time, he looks through the staging tree
for significant new users of counting semaphores and doesn't really find
any, so he is not concerned about those, but is more concerned about
read-write semaphores.
</p>

<p>
As for the choice of 2.6.38 as the basis for the next realtime tree,
Gleixner said that he picks the "<q>most convenient</q>" tree when
making that decision.  It depends on what is pending for the mainline, and
what went into the various kernel versions, because he does not want to
backport things into the realtime tree: "<q>I'm not insane</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
The realtime tree got started partially because of a conference he attended
in 2004 where various academics gathered there agreed that it was not
possible to turn a general purpose operating system into a realtime one.
He started working on it because of that technical challenge.  Along the
same lines, when asked what he would do with all the free time he would
have once the realtime code was upstream, Gleixner replied that he would
like to eliminate jiffies in the kernel.  He has a "<q>strong affinity
to mission impossible</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
One should be careful about choosing the realtime kernel and only use it if
you need the latency guarantees, he said.  So smartphone kernels might not
have any real need for such a kernel, he said.  But if the baseband stack
were to move to the main CPU, then it might make sense to look at using the
realtime code. One "<q>should only run such a beast if you really need
it</q>". That said, he rattled off a number of different projects that
were using the realtime kernel, including military, banking, and automation
applications. He closed with a short description of a gummy bear sorting
machine that used the realtime kernel, and was quite fancy, but after
watching it for a bit, you wouldn't want to see gummy bears again for a year.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Hm, to me it seems something else than preemption disable is needed <br>
for this situation.<br>
<p>
What is wanted is to atomically change some data, in a very fast way.<br>
To achieve this, the data is kept per-CPU, so no concurrent access<br>
happens, and preemption is disabled to avoid being interrupted by <br>
another task on the same CPU touching the same data.<br>
<p>
But what's really needed is avoiding preemption by tasks that would<br>
touch the same data, being preempted by other tasks is fine.<br>
<p>
So instead of using preemption, something more alike to coroutines<br>
can be used: Have a per-CPU data region task ID, used as a kind of<br>
lockless lock. When a task wants to access per-CPU data, it checks<br>
the ID first. If it already is set, it schedules to that task. If<br>
not, it writes its own ID atomically (but without lock prefix) and <br>
can access the data safely. It's basically a per-CPU mutex with<br>
special properties.<br>
<p>
That said, reducing the preemption-disabled window is always good.<br>

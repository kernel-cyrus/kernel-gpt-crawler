<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 4, 2015</br>
           </div>
The kernel's "ftrace" tracing machinery is useful for obtaining a great
deal of information about what is going on inside a running kernel.  What
ftrace generally does not provide is analysis features to "boil down"
tracing data into a more useful format.  Tom Zanussi's "<a
href="/Articles/635280/">hist triggers</a>" patch could change that
situation, but it has exposed a significant difference of opinion over how
such capabilities should be implemented in the kernel.
<p>
The idea behind hist triggers is simple enough: a user interested in a
histogram of tracing data would write a command string to the appropriate
ftrace control file specifying the parameters of the histogram.  For
example, one could look at <tt>kmalloc()</tt> calls with a command like:
<p>
<pre>
    # echo 'hist:key=call_site:val=bytes_req' &gt; \
           /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger
</pre>
<p>
Here, the <tt>hist:</tt> prefix indicates that histogram output is
desired.  The <tt>key=</tt> and <tt>val=</tt> parameters describe the axes
of the histogram; in this case, the user will get the total amount of
memory requested from each location where <tt>kmalloc()</tt> is called.
One obtains the results by reading the <tt>hist</tt> file that magically
pops up in the tracing control directory:
<p>
<pre>
    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kmem/kmalloc/hist
    trigger info: hist:keys=call_site:vals=bytes_req:sort=hitcount:size=2048 [active]

    call_site: 18446744071581750326 hitcount:          1  bytes_req:         24
    call_site: 18446744071583151255 hitcount:          1  bytes_req:         32
    call_site: 18446744071582443167 hitcount:          1  bytes_req:        264
    call_site: 18446744072104099935 hitcount:          2  bytes_req:        464
    call_site: 18446744071579323550 hitcount:          3  bytes_req:        168
    [...]
</pre>
<p>

There are additional options that can, for example, turn the call-site
address into a symbolic location.
This example was taken from <a href="/Articles/635523/">the documentation
posted with Tom's patch set</a>; many more examples and details can be
found there.
<p>
Tom thinks that this sort of functionality will be useful to a wide variety
of tracing users.  Indeed, it may reduce the need for more sophisticated
tools:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	A surprising number of typical use cases can be accomplished by
	users via this simple mechanism.  In fact, a large number of the
	tasks that users typically do using the more complicated
	script-based tracing tools, at least during the initial stages of
	an investigation, can be accomplished by simply specifying a set of
	keys and values to be used in the creation of a hash table.
</div>
<p>
Nobody seems to disagree that this would be a nice feature to have, but,
still, criticism of the patch set came from two directions.  Ftrace
maintainer Steve Rostedt <a href="/Articles/635524/">complained</a> that
the tracepoint code generating the histograms performs memory allocations;
those allocations are
necessary to maintain the hash table used to hold the histogram data.
Tracepoint callbacks can be called with all sorts of locks held; allocating
memory in such a situation is not a safe thing to do.  So, Steve said, that
aspect of the patch set is a "showstopper."  Future versions of the patch
set will, thus, have to accumulate this data without allocating memory in
the tracepoint callbacks.
<p>
A different type of criticism came from Alexei Starovoitov, the developer
behind the <a href="/Articles/612878/">eBPF work</a> that has gone into the
kernel over the last year.  One of the use cases for a tool like eBPF is to
allow users to gather data in kernel space and generate output in forms like
histograms.  Alexei thus duly <a href="/Articles/635527/">suggested</a>
that eBPF should be used to implement Tom's histogram functionality.
Rather than parse the commands in the kernel, though, Alexei would like to
see the development of a tool that would parse the same commands in user
space and load an eBPF program to do the actual work.
<p>
To Tom, the idea <a href="/Articles/635528/">seemed</a> "silly"; a lot of
work would be required to implement the functionality that already exists.
He saw the request as an attempt to force the use of eBPF on users who may
not want to deal with it.  Alexei <a href="/Articles/635529/">responded</a>
by saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Your 'hist-&gt;bpf' tool could have been first to solve 'bpf hard to
	use' problem and over time it could have evolved into full dtrace
	alternative.  Whereas by adding 'hist:keys=..' parsing to kernel
	you'll be stuck with it and somebody else's dtrace-like tool will
	supersede it.
</div>
<p>
Tom <a href="/Articles/635530/">remained unimpressed</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I think there's some misunderstanding there - it was never my
	intent to create a full dtrace alternative, really the idea was
	(and has been, even before there was any such thing as ebpf in the
	kernel) only to provide access to some low-hanging fruit via the
	standard read/write interfaces people are used to with ftrace.
</div>
<p>
In the end, there is an important question to answer here.  The eBPF
subsystem provides a mechanism by which a great deal of interesting
tracing functionality could be implemented without having to hardwire the
logic in the kernel.  Now that eBPF is here, adding new tracing modes as
more C code in the kernel could lead to duplicated functionality that needs
to be supported indefinitely, even if, someday, an alternative implemented
in eBPF draws most of the users.
<p>
On the other hand, the current interface to ftrace, wherein users write
simple control strings to a set of virtual files, appeals to a lot of
users.  It is relatively easy to work with, does not require any additional
tools to use, and is straightforward to script.  Some of those users would
not be pleased if they felt pushed to move over to an interface requiring
the compilation and loading of eBPF programs to get their work done.
<p>
This has the look of a debate that could go on for some time.  In the
absence of a decision by decree from a suitably placed subsystem
maintainer, it seems unlikely that the developers involved will settle on a
single approach to the problem of how to add new tracing features.  The
kernel's tracing subsystem is arguably at a fork in the road, but we may
not know which branch will be taken for a while yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Im of the opinion that the more tools that exist to provide introspection into the kernel, the better. I could care less if something ftrace can do can also be done with eBPF, I'm likely to use the ftrace mechanism in my embedded development. Its the path of least resistance in a system where I'll likely not even have a proper userspace implemented, nor the entire network subsystem compiled in, let alone the programs needed for working with eBPF. <br>
<p>
I feel like eBPF is a language meant for packet processing but has managed to extend its functionality beyond its intuitive scope of packet filtering and is now being used for things like secure computing. Not that its a bad thing this has happened, it shows the power of a flexibly designed system, but i severely doubt that the idea of doing syscall tracing using what sounds like a packet filtering language will appeal to the people who will might up using it.<br>
<p>
The interfaces and use-cases of the two facilities are drastically different from each other, and eBPF introduces a new language to learn and compile, and the idea of the possibility of having to debug the tool i am using to debug seems far less attractive than a bunch of pseudofiles that I can redirect strings to.<br>
<p>
For the crowd that is already doing things through eBPF, its great that it is capable of doing this, but please don't prevent further development of linux's beloved ftrace facility on the excuse that the packet processor can do the same things.<br>

<p>
You could conceptually think of a syscall as a "packet" sent to the kernel with a "request", and its "response" as another packet. (This probably makes more sense for some microkernels like seL4 where most system calls are treated as IPC to an in-kernel endpoint.)<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>October 31, 2007</br>
           </div>
<p> Linux capabilities
have been around for almost ten years now &ndash; they were originally
merged into a 2.1 kernel &ndash; but they haven't gotten a lot of use in
that time.  One pretty basic missing feature, support for <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/211883/">associating capabilities with
files</a>, has been merged for 2.6.24.  This allows a longstanding hack,
which redefines the proper usage of CAP_SETPCAP, to be fixed; this too has
been <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=72c2d5823fc7be799a12184974c3bdc57acea3c4">merged
into 2.6.24</a>.</p>

<p>
A bit of review is probably in order.  Capabilities are a way to separate
individual privileges that are normally all granted to the root user.
There are currently 31 different capabilities defined (in
<tt>linux/capability.h</tt>), but there are <a
href="/Articles/256541/">efforts underway to allow for expansion</a>.  The
idea is that a program should be able to set the system time, for example,
without needing the entire set of privileges that come with a
<tt>setuid(0)</tt> program.
</p>

<p>
Capabilities originally came from a proposed POSIX standard that was
eventually not adopted, but, in the meantime, got included into Linux.  The
feature has languished
since, for a number of reasons, but perhaps the largest was that there was no way to associate executable programs with a set of
capability bits.  Now that capability
bits can be stored in the extended attributes of files, the process can get
the proper capabilities
when the program is invoked.  Standard UNIX permissions still apply
&ndash; users can only execute programs they have an <tt>x</tt> bit
for.
</p>

<p>
In order to use capabilities at all, prior to being able to store them with
files, a method was needed to set the capabilities of a running process.
The <tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> capability was co-opted for this purpose.  A
process with this capability, which, in practice, meant root processes
could set the capabilities of another process.  If that process was meant
to be able to do the same &ndash; something that needs to be carefully
considered &ndash; it could get the <tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> bit as well.
</p>

<p>
This could really only be used to add capabilities to long running
processes that were not run as root (which has all of the capabilities), or
to remove some capabilities from daemons run as root.  Other schemes using
<tt>setuid</tt> wrappers for utility programs that needed some privileges
could also be imagined, but distributions or tools
that use capabilities are not widespread.
</p>

<p>
<tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> was never meant to have this behavior, so the recent
patch restores it its original meaning.  As odd as it might seem at
first, <tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> is only meant to allow changes to a process's
own capabilities; in fact, with this patch applied, there is no way for a
process to 
change a running process's capabilities.  That is probably the biggest
user-visible change.
</p>

<p>
Capabilities are not a
single set of bits, but are instead, three sets of bits representing the
effective, permitted, and inheritable capabilities of a process.  Files,
similarly, have three capability sets which are combined with those of the
process executing the file using the "capability rules" (described
in the patch and in an <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/199004/">LWN
article from a year ago</a>) to determine the three sets for the process
created.   
</p>

<p>
For processes, the effective set contains
those capabilities currently enabled &ndash; a process might drop some that
it is allowed once it has performed the corresponding privileged operation &ndash; while
the permitted set is a superset of the effective set, including all capabilities allowed to that process.  The inheritable set
are those that are passed on to a new program started by an <tt>exec()</tt>
call,
which is where the new <tt>CAP_SETPCAP</tt> comes into play; a process with
this capability can change its inheritable set to include any
capability, including those that are not in their permitted set.
</p>

<p>
This allows processes to bestow privileges that they do not possess upon
their children, which provides for some interesting uses.  It helps further
partition privileges by not requiring a process to have a particular
capability simply
to pass it on to children.  The example provided in the patch illustrates
this nicely: the <tt>login</tt> program does not require many privileges,
but through some policy mechanism (pam_cap for example) could allow certain users to have extra
capabilities.  Because the login process does not itself possess those
extra capabilities, 
this could limit the damage an exploit of <tt>login</tt> could do.
</p>

<p>
It is unclear whether these recent additions to the capability feature set
will result in more capability users.  There is a lot of work in the kernel
security space right now as kernel hackers and security folks try to come
up with sensible security solutions for Linux.  The complexity of SELinux,
along with the fact that many administrators disable it rather than try to
figure it out, 
seems to have the community casting about for other solutions. It is
possible that capabilities might be a part of another solution, though its
complexities are far from trivial.  Though most of the major distributions have
already made their security model choice, a capabilities-based
distribution would be interesting to see; it might make a nice project for
a smaller, up-and-coming, distribution to try.

Unfortunately, the word "capabilities" in the security world has two not-very-similar
meanings: "POSIX capabilities" and "regular capabilities".  The POSIX folks wanted to add some
of the features of a "capability" system, but by the time they were done, they ended up with
sets of bits that really were nothing like a real capability-based system.  Capability-based
systems are uncommon today, but they exist; EROS is a good example.

I don't understand why the inheritance bits make things much safer. If login doesn't have a
capability, but its children do, a crack of login can just run a program with the needed
capability. It's an extra hoop to jump through, but I don't see where it adds much.

<p>
That's if the crack is complete enough that it can run an arbitrary program.  Cracks are often much weaker.  For example, the program can be tricked into writing to an arbitrary file when it thinks it's writing to its log file because it uses an environment variable for the log file name.  If the program has voluntarily given up its ability to override file permissions, this crack won't get very far.  The program <em>is</em> able to spawn a child that can write to any file in the system, but this cracker isn't able to make it spawn one that will.
<p>
The other side of inherited capabilities is that you can make sure your child enjoys <em>less</em> privilege than you have.
<p>
But I don't know if any of this justifies an inheritable capability mask.  You could do just as well by setting your <b>effective</b> capabilities just before exec and have those be the inherited capabilities.

      <p><i>"... trying to come up  with ... sensible security solutions ... casting about ..."</i></p>

<p>Perhaps we should start with some sensible security <i>problems</i>.  What problems are we trying to solve?</p>

<p>One of my problems is that I don't want to give an application all of my privileges when I run it, but I still want to give it <i>some</i> of my privileges.  For example, I would like to download a nice new game off the Internet, extend to it my privilege to read and write in ~/.gamesave/newgame, and the privilege to open net connections to specified hosts, and the privilege of doing graphics and I/O in a constrained screen (e.g. a different X server, a different virtual terminal), but not give it the privilege of reading or writing any of my other files, performing other networking, continuing to run after I have shut it down, nor any other privileges.</p>

<p>Is this the same kind of problem that these security modules I keep reading about are trying to solve?</p>

<p>plash -- the <a href="http://plash.beasts.org">Principle of Least Authority Shell</a> seems like a good step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Note that plash is inspired by the theory of capability access control (although not by the "POSIX capabilities" that were the topic of this article.)</p>

On that note, I actually agree with the article that "a capabilities-based distribution would
be interesting to see" -- except with, you know, real capabilities :-).

Unix has them, after all -- fds are exactly capabilities.  (A pipe is a kernel-space ring
buffer with two facets, etc.)  The model is a little inelegant because you have normal
numbered fds, the quasi-fds for "current directory" and "root directory" (all the syscalls
that take filenames are effectively calls against the interface these fds provides), and the
vast number of syscalls that are available to every process provides a little more exposure
than one would like... (kill(2), for instance, is annoying).  But these seem mostly solveable,
and in these days of bind mounts, FUSE, containers, etc., one could do pretty credible
POLA/capability-style containment with the stock Linux kernel and a custom userspace.

Plus it seems worthwhile to try, because capabilities are the best chance for surviving worms
and all the other wonderful conveniences of the modern internet, but so long as they only live
in pure-research OSes they aren't going anywhere.  Building on Linux gives you its existing
userspace to use as a base, and lets you move quickly to dealing with the real problems of
building a practical system that one can deploy, administer, etc.  (Eros is very cool, but how
the heck could one ever practically administer or even understand a system whose whole state
is a blob of gigabytes of memory tied together willy-nilly by pointers?)

Err... ObOnTopic: Building a system like I describe is much easier given the existence of
CAP_SYS_CHROOT.  (Though another option would be to eliminate the root dir entirely by
chrooting everything to a designated unreadable/unwriteable/empty directory, and just using
openat() etc all the time.  ...Too bad there's no execat().)

Is this the same kind of problem that these security modules I keep reading about are trying to solve?

<p>
I think it is, but a similar problem is equally important: you're running code which is essentially trusted (maybe you wrote it yourself), but you know it might be broken.  While this program isn't <em>supposed</em> to erase log files, a cracker might exploit a bug and make it try.  So you'd like a safety net, immune to any bug that might exist in that program.
<p>
In classic Unix, you'd have a problem establishing that safety net if the program must be able to scan all the files on the system, because the same privilege that lets you read all the files (superuser) also lets you write to them.
<p>
The Linux privilege classes ("capabilities") don't seem well chosen, though.  6-10 of them (depending on other system properties) are equivalent to all the rest -- i.e. having one allows you to get the rest.  And most of the privileges you'd like to separate are piled into one: CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

The general use of CAP_SYS_ADMIN all around the kernel is what makes me doubt of any new
capability system extensions to what exists now.

I'm no security expert, but can't understand how they can overcame that without a major
overhaul all around the kernel code.

I see this new features as nice things to help secure a system, but this all seem just more
"hacks" around the fact there isn't any "grand scheme" for security well thought (I mean, in a
modern way, because we all know traditional UNIX security way is just obsolete).

@zooko: No, it's not.  Linux capabilities are basically about replacing suid bits with something more fine-grained, and it doesn't improve security much, IMHO, although it's nice from the marketing point of view - "hey, look, no suids!".<br>
<p>
In other words, Linux capabilities are about giving additional privileges to processes, and what you're asking for is about adding additional restrictions to processes.<br>

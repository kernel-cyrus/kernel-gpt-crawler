           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 16, 2011</br>
           </div>
The <tt>ioctl()</tt> system call has a bad reputation for a number of
reasons, most of which are related to the fact that every implemented
command is, in essence, a new system call.  There is no way to effectively
control what is done in <tt>ioctl()</tt>, and, for many obscure drivers, no
way to really even know what is going on without digging through a lot of
old code.  So it's not surprising that code adding new <tt>ioctl()</tt>
commands tends to be scrutinized heavily.  Recently it turned out that
there's another reason to be nervous about <tt>ioctl()</tt> - it doesn't
play well with security modules, and SELinux has been treating it
incorrectly for the last couple of years.
<p>
SELinux works by matching a specific access attempt against the permissions
granted to the calling process.  For system calls like <tt>write()</tt>,
the type of access is obvious - the process is attempting to write to an
object.  With <tt>ioctl()</tt>, things are not quite so clear.  In past
times, SELinux would attempt to deal with <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls by looking
at the specific command to figure out what the process was actually trying
to do; a <tt>FIBMAP</tt> command, for example (which reads a map of a
file's block locations) would be allowed to proceed if the calling process
had the permission to read the file's attributes.
<p>
There are a couple of problems with this approach, starting with the fact
that the number of possible <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands is huge.  Even
without getting into obscure commands implemented by a single driver,
trying to enumerate them all and determine their effects is a road to
madness.  But it gets worse, in that the intended behavior of a given
command may not match what a specific driver actually does in response to
that command.  So the only way to really know what an <tt>ioctl()</tt>
command will do is to figure out what driver is behind the call, and to
have some knowledge of what each driver does.  Simply
creating this capability is not a task for sane people; maintaining it
would not be a task for anybody wanting to remain sane.  So security module
developers were looking for a better way.
<p>
They thought they had found one when somebody realized that the command
codes used by <tt>ioctl()</tt> implementations are not random numbers.
They are, instead, a carefully-crafted 32-bit quantity which includes an
8-bit "type" field (approximately identifying the driver implementing the
command), a driver-specific command code, a pair of read/write bits, and a
size field.  Using the read/write bits seemed like a great way to figure
out what sort of access the <tt>ioctl()</tt> call needed without actually
understanding the command.  Thus, <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=242631c49d4cf39642741d6627750151b058233b">a
patch to SELinux</a> was merged for 2.6.27 which ripped out the command
recognition and simply used the read/write bits in the command code to
determine whether a specific call should be allowed or not.
<p>
That change remained for well over two years until Eric Paris <a
href="/Articles/428142/">noticed</a> that, in fact, it made no sense at
all.  Most <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls involve the passing of a data structure
into or out of the kernel; that structure describes the operation to be
performed or holds data returned from the kernel - or both.  The size field
in the command code is the size of this structure, and the permission bits
describe how the structure will be accessed by the kernel.  Together, that
information 
can be used by the core <tt>ioctl()</tt> code to determine whether the
calling process has the proper access rights to the memory behind the
pointer passed to the kernel.
<p>
What those bits do <i>not</i> do, as Eric pointed out, is say anything
about what the <tt>ioctl()</tt> call will do to the object identified by
the file descriptor passed to the kernel.  A call passing read-only data to
the kernel may reformat a disk, while a call with writable data may just be
querying hardware information.  So using those bits to determine whether
the call should proceed is unlikely to yield good results.  It's an
observation which seems obvious when spelled out in this way, but none of
the developers working on security noticed the problem at the time.
<p>
So that code has to go - but, as of this writing, it has not been changed
in the mainline kernel.  There is a simple reason for that: nobody really
knows what sort of logic should replace it.  As discussed above, simply
enumerating command codes with expected behavior is not a feasible solution
either.  So something else needs to be devised, but it's not clear what
that will be.
<p>
Stephen Smalley <a href="/Articles/428143/">pointed out</a> one approach
which was <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-security-module&m=113088357020104&w=2">posted</a>
back in 2005.  That patch required drivers (and other code implementing
<tt>ioctl()</tt>) to provide a special table associating each command code
with the permissions required to execute the command.  The obvious
objections were raised at that time: changing every driver in the system
would be a pain, <tt>ioctl()</tt> implementations are already messy enough
as it is, the tables would not be maintained as the driver changed, and so
on.  The idea was eventually dropped.  Bringing it back now seems unlikely
to make anybody popular, but there is probably no other way to truly track
what every <tt>ioctl()</tt> command is actually doing.  That knowledge
resides exclusively in the implementing code, so, if we want to make use of
that knowledge elsewhere, it needs to be exported somehow.
<p>
Of course, the alternative is to conclude that (1) <tt>ioctl()</tt> is a
pain, and (2)&nbsp;security modules are a pain.  Perhaps it's better to
just give up and hope that discretionary access controls, along with
whatever checks may be built into the driver itself, will be enough.  That
is, essentially, the solution we have now.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Making ioctls more painful to maintain might encourage people to add less new ones though, which would probably make many people happy.<br>

Well, one possible fix is to rip the ioctl() and unlocked_ioctl() operations out of file_operations completely, turning them into a mandatory lookup into a (per-driver? per-filesystem?) map from ioctl request to (read_required, write_required, function to call to implement this operation).<br>
<p>
Upside: makes it impossible to define a new ioctl() request without specifying whether it is a read or write op. Downside: this is... unlikely to be a nondisruptive change, and it's only really for the benefit of LSMs (since the read/write permission bits on devices supporting ioctl() are not used to validate this sort of thing, though they should be, but that would probably break too much of userspace). Which is probably why nobody's done it already.<br>

They would: the problem is, essentially: "Should we allow this interaction, which is between a process and something else outside that process?"<br>
<p>
The answer, clearly, depends on what the interaction is, which means that the security module doing the evaluation must *know* all the possible interactions.  <br>
<p>
That way, clearly, lies madness, as our Esteemed Editor implies.<br>
<p>
Your expansion, though, explains why this hasn't been fixed:  the problem isn't syntactic.  It's semantic.  It doesn't really matter how you express it: there needs to be a way to have these conversations, on all by the most trivial implementations, and there's no way to predict what they will be... 10 years from now.<br>

How does the 2005 patch force anything at all? The ioctl entrypoints drive all the checking themselves, no matter what it seems -- <code>ioctl_perm()</code> is just a linear search, you'd express it directly in C++ with plain find().
<p>
It looks like the mistake with the <code>DIR</code> bits was made immediately when the earlier patch was proposed, and the resulting bad patch was just <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-security-module&m=113163500109659&w=2">Smalley taking somebody's word for it</a> on what those bits mean.
<p>
Aren't ioctl numbers part of the userland ABI, set permanently?  If so, how is drift a concern here?

But isn't the same problem already present with DAC? Somebody, somewhere, already has to prevent object-changing ioctls on read-only file descriptors.<br>
<p>
What does SELinux want to add to the mix? Is it only so that an object-changing ioctl needs the current role to have {write} rights, while for other ioctls you only need {read}? Does this offer anything in addition to the DAC check above, which is always done anyway?<br>
<p>
I think the ideas in this direction are sufficiently vague because ioctls do such a wide range of things.<br>

Let's start with the basics: in which manpage is (for example) the mentioned FIEMAP documented?<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>January 9, 2013</br>
           </div>
<p>
The Linux kernel's firewall and packet filtering support has seen quite a few
changes over the years. Back in 2009, it looked like a new packet filtering
mechanism, <a href="/Articles/324989/">nftables</a>, was set to be the next
generation solution for Linux.  
It was <a href="/Articles/413036/">mentioned</a> at the 2010 Kernel Summit
as a solution that might apply more widely than just for netfilter. 
But nftables  development
stalled, until it was <a href="/Articles/531876/">resurrected</a> in 2012
by netfilter maintainer  Pablo Neira Ayuso.  During the lull, however,
another, more incremental change to the existing netfilter code had been
developed; <a href="/Articles/531877/">Xtables2 was proposed for
merging</a> by Jan Engelhardt in mid-December. Many of the same problems
in the existing code are targeted by both solutions, so it seems likely that just
one or the other gets merged&mdash;the decision on which is the
subject of some debate.
</p>

<p>
Xtables2 has been under development since 2010 or so; Engelhardt gave a <a
href="http://inai.de/documents/Love_for_blobs.pdf">presentation [PDF]</a> on
it at the 2010 Netfilter workshop. Over the last few years, he has
occasionally posted progress reports, but the pace of those (and
development itself) seems to have picked up after Neira posted his
intention to restart nftables development back in October.  Given that it
will be difficult&mdash;impossible, really&mdash;to sell two new packet
filtering schemes, either the two will need to come together somehow, or
one will have to win out.

<p>
At least so far, Neira and Engelhardt don't agree about the
direction that netfilter should take.  After the October nftables announcement,
Engelhardt <a href="/Articles/531969/">pointed out</a> that one of the
missing nftables features noted by Neira was already available in Xtables2: "<q>atomic table replace and atomic
dump</q>". 
 Neira's <a
href="/Articles/531968/">suggestion</a> that Engelhardt look at adding the
feature to nftables was rebuffed.
Beyond that, though, Neira also <a href="/Articles/531972/">said</a> that
it would be "<q>*extremely hard* to justify its [Xtables2's] inclusion
into mainline</q>".  To Engelhardt, and perhaps others, that sounded
like a pre-judgment against merging Xtables2, which "<q>would be really
sad</q>", he <a href="/Articles/531973/">said</a>.  He continued by
listing a number
of useful features already available in Xtables2, including network
namespace support, a netlink interface, read-copy update (RCU) support,
atomic chain and table replacement, and more.

<p>
Much of Neira's announcement concerned the "compatibility layer" that will
be needed for any
replacement of the existing netfilter code.  There are far too many users
of <tt>iptables</tt> to leave behind&mdash;not to mention the "no ABI
breakage" kernel rule.  So, for some period of time, both the existing code
that supports <tt>iptables</tt> and any new
solution will have to coexist in the kernel.  Eventually, the older code
can be removed.

<p>
One the main problems that both nftables and Xtables2 address is the code
duplication that exists in the existing netfilter implementation
(which is often referred to as "xtables").  Because that code is
protocol-aware, it 
was essentially necessary to make four copies of much of it in the
kernel to handle each different use case: IPv4, IPv6, ARP, and ethernet
bridging.  That is clearly 
sub-optimal, and something that both Xtables2 and nftables address.  The
difference is in <i>how</i> they address it.  With Xtables2, a single
protocol-independent table is used per network namespace, while nftables
defines a new virtual machine to process packets.  Essentially, Xtables2
(as its name would imply) is an evolution of the existing code, while
nftables is a more fundamental rework of Linux packet filtering.
</p>

<p>
That difference in approaches is evident in the discussion over
Engelhardt's merge request.  Neira is <a href="/Articles/532077/">not
impressed with the feature set</a>, but he also <a href="/Articles/532078/">complains</a> that Xtables2 "<q>inherits many of the
design decisions that were taken while designing iptables back in the
late nineties</q>".  As might be guessed, Engelhardt <a
href="/Articles/532084/">saw things differently</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
nf_tables itself retains some "late nineties" design decisions as
well.
<p>
In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with keeping some concepts. A
developer is not required to reevaluate and reinnovate every concept
there has been just for the heck of it. (The old "evolution, not
revolution" credo.) Throwing everything overboard generally does not
turn out to work these days.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Nftables is hardly a revolution, Neira <a
href="/Articles/532139/">said</a>, because it implements backward
compatibility: "<q>revolutions are never
backward compatible</q>".  Further discussion noted a number of
conceptual similarities between the two approaches, with each side
predictably arguing that their solution could do most or all of what the
other could do.  
</p>

<p>
There are some differences between the two, though.  For one thing,
Xtables2 seems further along, both with its code and with things like <a
href="http://inai.de/nfxt/Xtables2_Userdoc.txt">documentation</a> and a <a
href="http://inai.de/nfxt/roadmap.php">roadmap</a>. As Neira <a
href="/Articles/532140/">noted</a>, the development hiatus for nftables
clearly set the project back a ways, but he is not ready to provide more
details quite yet:
<div class="BigQuote">
I understand you want to know more on the future of nftables, but
because the way I am, I prefer to skip "hot air" wording by now and
talk on code done anytime soon.
<p>
So I have to request some patience from you. We promise to deliver as
much information as possible once we are done with the core features.
</div>
</p>

<p>
So there are two competing proposals for how to move forward with
netfilter, one that is largely ready (though certainly not complete),
according to Engelhardt, and one that is still under active "core"
development.  While once seen as the likely successor, nftables certainly
suffered from lack of attention for a few years, while Xtables2 was
seemingly chugging along for much of that time.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, both Engelhardt and Neira favor their chosen solutions, and
neither seems likely to join forces with the other.  Engelhardt <a
href="/Articles/532145/">indicated</a> that he isn't advocating dropping
nftables, necessarily, but is instead focused on getting Xtables2 features
into the hands of users:
<div class="BigQuote">
In all fairness, I have never said anything about dropping nft.
I am focused on xt2, its inclusion and subsequent maintenance, because 
it resolves the ipt shortcomings in a way that I think appeals most to 
the userspace crowd.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Neira <a href="/Articles/532146/">proposed</a> a discussion at this year's
Netfilter workshop (which should happen by mid-year) to try to resolve the
issue.  While Engelhardt expressed some concern over the wait, a few months
may be needed as Jozsef Kadlecsik <a href="/Articles/532147/">pointed
out</a>: "<q>Both 
nftables and xtables2 have got nice features, so it's not a simple 
question.</q>"  Network maintainer David Miller concurred with Neira's
proposal. 
</p>

<p>
While it may be technically possible to merge Xtables2 and start down the
path toward removing the older interface, then switch to nftables when it
is ready, it seems an unlikely outcome.
If the netfilter developers (and maintainers) are convinced that nftables
is the right way forward, skipping the Xtables2 step makes sense.  That may
mean a longer delay before some of the 
longstanding problems in the existing code are addressed, but trying to
maintain three different packet filtering schemes in the kernel is simply
not going to happen.

Hardly surprising.  Unless the net filter mob have changed their habits substantially they will have not have any userland documentation whatsoever.  (If I am wrong some _please_ point to me the doco.  I would love to be proven wrong.)<br>

Hmm.  While conceptually nice, what's that going to do to throughput?  Are they going to be JIT-compiling it?  And, if so, has anyone thought about security implications?  <p>

It seems to me that iptables, even with its internal warts, is one of the best features in Linux, both powerful and extremely fast.  Throwing away a good design because it's old has a strong flavor of NIH.  Doing a virtual machine just to <I>do</i> one seems pretty silly to me; what would the specific advantages be?  If it's for weird packet mangling, is the overhead of a virtual machine worth carrying around to handle those corner cases better?   Or would they be better served by userspace code of some kind?<P>

      <p>Disclaimer: I'm not a kernel developer, this is simply my understanding of things based on experience with iptables.</p>

<blockquote>&gt; what would the specific advantages be?</blockquote>

<p>Because that's the natural way people want to write firewall rules.</p>

<p>Right now each firewall rule has to stand on its own and you get no control over which order certain terms are evaluated. For example, if you want to whitelist SSH connections from 3 different IP addresses, you basically have to write the firewall like:</p>

<pre>
if (net_layer == IP &amp;&amp; ip_address == 1.2.3.4 &amp;&amp; transport_layer == TCP &amp;&amp; tcp_port == 22) { ACCEPT; }
if (net_layer == IP &amp;&amp; ip_address == 2.2.2.2 &amp;&amp; transport_layer == TCP &amp;&amp; tcp_port == 22) { ACCEPT; }
if (net_layer == IP &amp;&amp; ip_address == 3.3.3.3 &amp;&amp; transport_layer == TCP &amp;&amp; tcp_port == 22) { ACCEPT; }
if (net_layer == IP &amp;&amp; transport_layer == TCP &amp;&amp; tcp_port == 22) { DROP; }
</pre>

<p>Not only is this annoying to write and manage, but it's also very inefficient. Clearly any sane person would instead write:</p>

<pre>
if(net_layer == IP &amp;&amp; transport_layer == TCP &amp;&amp; tcp_port == 22) {
  if (ip_address == 1.2.3.4 || ip_address == 2.2.2.2 || ip_address == 3.3.3.3) { ACCEPT; }
  DROP;
}
</pre>

<p>And while you can use separate rule chains to abstract out these patterns, that's like going back in time many decades of computer programming and using "goto" statements for all your control logic.</p>

<p>For this particular use case, you could also use the iptables "ipset" module (which can match a set of IP addresses in one rule), but that's more of a workaround for the shortcomings of iptables: It requires a separate user space utility then to manage these custom named IP address sets via a separate kernel API. There are tons and tons of these special case modules.</p>

<p>There's also the problem that currently, every different kind of rule requires support in user space (to parse the command line and serialize it for the kernel) AND in the kernel (to deserialize the data and do the matching specific to this rule). Basically 95% boilerplate and 5% substance -- waste of developer resources, memory, CPU cache, etc.</p>

<p>It would be a lot more flexible to provide an abstract virtual machine in the kernel and let the user space generate whatever code it needs to support the protocol it wants. That's how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter">bpf</a> already works in the kernel, for packet capture and seccomp system call filters.</p>

<blockquote>&gt; iptables, even with its internal warts, is one of the best features in Linux, both powerful and extremely fast.</blockquote>

<p>As a programmer, I would say extremely contrived and inefficient. I'm genuinely surprised it has survived for this long.</p>

      You're badly misrepresenting iptables though. The tables are NOT like goto, they're like functions which can return to the calling chain, in addition to terminating rule processing for the packet. So your iptables example can be factored in several ways. E.g.:
<p>
<pre>
accept_allowed_ssh_hosts () {
  if (proto != tcp)
    RETURN;
  if (port != ssh)
    RETURN;

  if (ip == 1.2.3.4) ACCEPT;
  if (ip == 2.2.2.2) ACCEPT;
  if (ip == 3.3.3.3) ACCEPT;
}
</pre><p>
And somewhere in INPUT:
<pre>
accept_allowed_ssh_hosts ();
…
DROP;
</pre><p>
Note also the existing iptables language could be compiled to something suitable for a JIT. If there's any control-flow it is missing, it could be added, without throwing away the interface that is there today.

Good point, I never thought of structuring my rules this way. It's better, but it requires you to artificially split things into separate chains and specify lots of things using negative logic, which is far from natural.<br>
<p>
I just went the easy route and use FERM to translate between my brain and iptables.<br>

      <I>Right now each firewall rule has to stand on its own and you get no control over which order certain terms are evaluated.</i><P>

Are we talking about the same thing?  The language you're using in your examples isn't anything I recognize as being iptables-related, and I don't see anything being done with chains, which is kind of the point of the whole system. Are you confusing it with something else, maybe?<P>

In iptables, there are five root chains in the network stack: PREROUTING, FORWARD, INPUT, OUTPUT, and POSTROUTING, plus any arbitrary number of user chains inserted wherever one likes.  Typically, the great majority of the work is done on the FORWARD and INPUT chains.<P>

Because you can have any number of chains, it's fairly typical to 'divide and conquer'; that is, test if it's a TCP packet, and jump to a TCP chain, which then checks for port matches, and then makes decisions.  And this full evaluation process is not normally followed for every packet; typically, packets that match the keywords ESTABLISHED and RELATED are short-circuit accepted, without any further processing, and this basically consists of a lookup in a connection table.  So it's really fast with most of the packets in a session (usually all but the first couple).  Novel packets, ones that either signify a new connection or are unwanted, are usually navigating down a tree of tests, which means that any given packet won't usually need very many decisions.  I imagine this condenses down into quite a short number of actual hardware instructions.  Whatever the internals actually look like, it certainly <I>seems</i> efficient, as a Linux router/firewall is able to move a very large amount of traffic without needing dedicated hardware support. <P>

So, a virtual machine is cleaner, but probably less efficient.  And I'm wondering if a general code cleanup on the existing system might not end up being better.  I cheerfully concede that it's ugly as hell, but it seems very, very fast.  That's an absolutely critical feature in firewalls, perhaps <I>the</i> crucial feature, after being able to do basic stateful inspection.<P>

The nastiness with having to pass off to user processes for advanced inspection is something that only people who want that functionality have to deal with, where putting a VM in there may potentially slow everyone down, making all of us pay for a few corner cases that most of us have no interest in.<P>

All I really care about is speed, so if they can make the VM run as fast as regular iptables, then I have no other objection.  It's not like my objection really matters anyway, I don't suppose, since I'm not writing the code, but still.<P>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;Right now each firewall rule has to stand on its own and you get no control over which order certain terms are evaluated.</font><br>
<p>
Rule evaluation order is very well defined, it follows the usual left-to-right evaluation with short-circuit semantics like the &amp;&amp; operator in C.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;It would be a lot more flexible to provide an abstract virtual machine in the kernel and let the user space generate whatever code it needs to support the protocol it wants. That's how bpf already works in the kernel,</font><br>
<p>
iptables is already a VM of sorts. In addition, remember that xt_u32 has been in the kernel for a long time, and it looks like we will be gaining xt_bpf shortly as well.<br>
<p>
But none of them is meant to deal with low-performing rules. If you test a condition multiple times, BPF should be doing it. If there is any static optimization such as common subexpression elimination to be done, then, I.M.H.O., userspace should be doing that before passing on the filter data to the kernel.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 25, 2008</br>
           </div>
On June 23, HP <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/287057/">announced</a> that
it was releasing the source for the "Tru64 
Advanced Filesystem" (or AdvFS) under version&nbsp;2 of the GPL.  This is,
clearly, a large release of code from HP.  What is a bit less clear
is what the value of this release will be for Linux.  In the end, that
value is likely to be significant, but it will be probably realized in
relatively indirect and difficult-to-measure ways.
<p>

AdvFS was originally developed by Digital Equipment Corporation for its
version of Unix; HP picked it up when it acquired Compaq, which had
acquired DEC in 1998.  This filesystem offers a number of the usual
features.  It is intended to be a high-performance filesystem, naturally.
Extent-based block management and directory indexes are provided.
It does journaling for fast crash recovery.  There is an undelete feature.
AdvFS is also designed to work in clustered environments.
<p>

Much of the thought that went into AdvFS was concerned with avoiding the
need to take the system down.  There is a snapshot feature which
can be used to make consistent backups of running systems.  Defragmentation
can be done online.  There is a built-in volume management layer which
allows storage devices to be added to (or removed from) a running
filesystem; files can also be relocated across devices.  The internal
volume manager can perform striping of files across devices, but nothing
more advanced than that; AdvFS will happily work on top of a more capable
volume manager, though.
<p>

There are a few things which AdvFS does not have.  There is no checksumming
of data, and, thus, no ability to catch corruption.  Online filesystem
integrity checking does not appear to be supported.  The maximum filesystem
size (16TB) probably seemed infinite in the early 1990's, but it's starting
to look a little tight now.


In general, AdvFS looks like something which was a very nice filesystem 
ten or fifteen years ago, but it has little that is not either available in
Linux now, or 
in the works for the near future.  And AdvFS doesn't even work with Linux -
no porting effort has been made, and it's not clear that one will be made.
So is this release just another dump of code being abandoned by its
corporate owner?
<p>

One could make a first answer by saying that, even if this were true, it
would still be welcome.  If a company gives up on a piece of code, it's far
preferable to put it out for adoption under the GPL than to let it rot
until nobody can find it anymore.  But there may well be value in this
release.
<p>

Even if there is no point in trying to make it work under Linux, the AdvFS
code is the repository of more than a decade of experience of making a
high-end filesystem work in a commercial environment.  Your editor had
stopped working with DEC systems by the time AdvFS came out, but the word
he heard from others is that the early releases were, shall we say,
something that taught
administrators about the value of frequent backups.  But after a few major
releases, AdvFS had stabilized into a fast, solid, and reliable
filesystem.  The current code will embody all of the hard lessons that were
learned in the process of getting to that point.
<p>

Chris Mason, who is currently working on the Btrfs filesystem, <a
href="/Articles/287301/">puts it this way</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The idea is that well established filesystems can teach us quite a
	lot about layout, and about the optimizations that were added in
	response to customer demand.  Having the code to these
	optimizations is very useful.
</div>
<p>
Having that code licensed under the GPL is especially useful: any code
which is useful in its current form can be pulled quickly into Linux.  And,
even when the code itself cannot be used, the ideas that it embodies can be
borrowed without fear.  And that is <a href="/Articles/287306/">exactly
what HP was hoping to encourage</a> with this release:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In case its not clear, this is a GPLv2 technology release, not an
	actual port to Linux.  We're hoping that the code and documentation
	will be helpful in the development of new file systems for Linux
	that will provide similar capabilities, and perhaps used to make
	tweaks to existing file systems.
</div>
<p>
And that would appear to be likely to happen.  Over time, the best ideas
and experience from AdvFS should find their way into the filesystems
supported by Linux, even if AdvFS, itself, never becomes one of those
filesystems.  So HP has made a significant contribution to the kernel
development process, one which will probably never show up in the changeset
counts and other easily-obtained metrics.
<p>

(Those interested in learning more about AdvFS would be well advised to
grab the documentation tarball from the <a
href="http://advfs.sourceforge.net/">AdvFS sourceforge page</a>.  The
"Hitchhiker's guide" is a good starting place, though, at 229 pages, it's
not for hitchhikers who prefer to travel light.)

We have used AdvFS on our Digital Unix systems for a decade or so, and
I agree with this assessment.

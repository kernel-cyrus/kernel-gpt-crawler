The developers working on the initial OLPC laptop ran into an interesting
problem: the camera driver would fail to initialize if it was built into
the kernel, but it worked just fine if built as a module.  That problem
still exists; it is a symptom of an issue which comes up frequently in
contemporary systems: there is no way to know at build time what
dependencies exist between different hardware units, so there is no way to ensure that
drivers are loaded in the right order.  A new patch from Grant Likely tries
to solve that problem in a simple sort of way; it will probably improve the
situation, but a complete solution is still lacking.
<p>
The problem with the camera driver is a result of the fact that the
"camera" is, in reality, three devices working in concert: a DMA bridge, a
sensor, and an I2C bus connecting the two.  The bridge (which plays the
role of the overall "camera driver") must locate and identify the sensor as
part of its setup routine; if the sensor does not exist, initialization
will fail.  But the sensor will not exist until its driver and the I2C bus
driver have been loaded into the system.  If all of the drivers are built
into the kernel, the bridge driver's <tt>probe()</tt> function may be
called first; there will be no sensor, so everything fails.
<p>
Contemporary systems - especially those of the mobile variety - are
increasingly built this way.  Grant gave <a
href="/Articles/450463/">another example</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	A "sound card" typically consists of multiple devices; one or more
	codecs (often i2c or spi attached), a sound bus (often i2s), a dma
	controller, and a lump of machine/platform specific code that ties
	them all together.  Right now the ASoC code is going through all
	kinds of gymnastics make each component register with the ASoC
	layer and the 'tie together' driver has to wait for each of them to
	show up.
</div>
<p>
The key point to understand is that the various components that make up a
"device" may appear to be entirely unrelated at the hardware level.  They
can be on different buses; some of them may be subcomponents of entirely
different devices.  A general-purpose kernel has no real way to know what
the real dependencies between devices are until all of the pieces are
present and have started to recognize each other.
<p>
Grant's <a href="/Articles/450178/">patch</a> takes a simple approach to
solving this problem: drivers which are unable to initialize their devices
as the result of missing resources can request that the operation be
retried at some point in the future.  That request is a simple matter of
returning <tt>-EAGAIN</tt> from the <tt>probe()</tt> function.  The driver
core maintains a simple linked list of drivers that have requested this
sort of deferral; when the time seems right, the deferred <tt>probe()</tt>
invocations are retried to see if things work any better.
<p>
One of the concerns raised with regard to this patch had to do with the
determination of the right time.  How might the kernel know when a failed 
initialization might work?  The event which may change the situation is the
successful addition of a new device to the system, so the current patch
retries all of the deferred calls every time a new device shows up.  The
mechanism used for the retries (a workqueue) will tend to coalesce these
attempts when a lot of devices are being registered (during system boot,
for example), but it still strikes some reviewers as being inefficient.
Grant has promised a revision of the patch which improves the situation.
<p>
A related question is: when can the kernel conclude that there is no longer
any point in retrying a specific driver's <tt>probe()</tt> function?  In
today's dynamic hardware environment, there never comes a point where one
can say that no more devices will show up.  This question has no real
answer; it could be that, in a poorly configured or broken system, the
process will never terminate.  The cost of a driver stuck in the deferred
state should be small, though.
<p>
Others have questioned the need for this mechanism at all, but the
responses have made it clear that something needs to be done to address
this kind of hardware.  A proper solution in the driver core seems like a
better answer than a bunch of one-off hacks in specific drivers.  So
something will probably go in.
<p>
Someday perhaps we will see a more elegant and efficient mechanism.  One
could imagine an API allowing a driver to specify which resources it is
looking for; that driver's <tt>probe()</tt> function would then be put on
hold until those resources become available.  The driver core already
generates events when new devices become available; some code matching
those events to waiting drivers could be the last piece.  But there would
be a need to come up with a language by which a driver could express a need
like "a device at address 42 on this I2C bus"; getting that right could
take some work.
<p>
Meanwhile, Grant's patch offers a "good enough" solution which appears
capable of solving the problem most of the time.  Accepting "good enough"
when it's truly good enough is a key part of pragmatic programming.  So
chances are we'll have deferred driver initialization in the kernel
sometime soon; fancier mechanisms may be rather longer in coming.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I wonder if the devicetree concept could be leveraged for this, either with the boot system passing the info to the kernel, or with the drivers adding information about the pieces that they are looking for.<br>

If a device consists of multiple parts, the driver does also; so isn't this quite easily fixed in the driver, when for example its I2C device has been probed, to retry initialization of the other parts of the device?<br>
<p>
I'd even say a driver is broken if it makes assumptions like this, because the I2C bus driver may be a module too which might be inserted later on.<br>

Would this correspond at all with the power domains work? In other words, do device manufacturers ensure that these seemingly unrelated devices share a "power domain" which might be usable as a means of triggering probing? Unfortunately it's not clear to me how power domains are created based on discovered hardware so I could be talking complete nonsense.<br>
<p>
I ask because I seem to recall that power domains are sometimes independent of the device tree topology and these conglomerate devices seem to be as well. Also it seems kind of pointless to power only half of a "device" that is composed in this way...<br>

Why can't the -&gt;probe() just succeed anyway, and the driver check at -&gt;open() time if the necessary other devices have deigned to show up to work?<br>

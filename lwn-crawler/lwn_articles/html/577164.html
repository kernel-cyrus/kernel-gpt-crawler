<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking">Port knocking</a> is a
longstanding technique to evade port scans that is
typically implemented in user space.  A recent <a
href="/Articles/576452/">patch</a> proposed for the kernel would change
that by adding support for port knocking into the TCP/IP stack itself. 
Beyond just allowing administrators to hide open ports, the patch would
also provide some ability to 
thwart man-in-the-middle attackers either from making their own connections to
those hidden ports or from hijacking those established by friendly
clients.  But the patch is facing some pushback from the network
developers who think that user space is a better place to handle features
like port knocking.
</p>

<p>
The details of the "knock" vary, but the basic idea for port knocking is
that a protected port on a server will not respond to the normal
connection-establishment protocol; instead, some special steps will be
required to make a connection to the port.  Those steps might include
making a connection attempt to a different port, or to a series of
ports, that 
show the server that the client knows the secret knock to gain entry to the
clubhouse. Since port scanning programs generally don't know the secret knock
and it is expensive to try lots of possibilities, the services
behind the knock are hidden from view.
</p>

<p>
There are a few different reasons to hide a service.  One is that the
server 
program may have vulnerabilities, either because it has not been kept
up-to-date or because there are unknown flaws in the code.  If only trusted
 people know about the knock, it reduces the threat of someone
exploiting the hole.  In addition, hiding services like SSH will avoid
brute-force username/password guessing attacks.

<p>
But there is another reason to hide the existence of
a service: it
may be illegal in certain jurisdictions or running it may draw unwanted
attention to 
the host and its owner.  
Folks running Tor bridges or other
privacy-oriented services may see them blacklisted by
government-controlled internet service providers—or prompt a visit from
some secret service. 
</p>

<p>
Existing port knocking solutions generally either monitor firewall logs
or capture packets from user space, then modify the firewall to open the
port when the proper knock is detected.  The <a
href="https://gnunet.org/knock">Knock project</a>—a part of the <a
href="https://gnunet.org/">GNUnet project</a>—looks to turn that on its
head.  With a few-hundred-line patch, authors Maurice Leclair, Julian
Kirsch, and Christian Grothoff would move the port-knocking logic into the
Linux networking stack.  That would allow clients and servers to communicate,
while hiding behind a port knock, simply by using the
new <tt>TCP_STEALTH</tt> option to <tt>setsockopt()</tt>.  If the code were
widely available in most Linux kernels, users could rely on the feature
being available, without having to install and configure some other port
knocking solution.
</p>

<p>
Knock is different than other solutions in a couple of other ways.  To
start with, it is meant to be undetectable to a man in the middle.  It just
looks like a normal connection establishment to a particular port—there is
no extra 
sequences of connections to other ports or other special knocks.  It uses
a technique called "silent knocking" that requires sharing a secret between
the client and server using some unspecified, out-of-band mechanism.  That 
secret is used to calculate the sequence number of the initial <tt>SYN</tt>
packet that is 
sent to initiate the three-way handshake that starts TCP connections.
Any <tt>SYN</tt> with an improper sequence number gets an <tt>RST</tt>
reply; exactly what it would get for a closed port.
</p>

<p>
In addition, using the <tt>TCP_STEALTH_INTEGRITY</tt> option allows the the
first bytes of the payload data to be protected by a
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code">hash-based
message authentication code</a> (HMAC), which effectively stops active
man-in-the-middle attackers from hijacking the connection once it has been
established.  Essentially, the top 16 bits of the sequence number in the
<tt>SYN</tt> packet correspond to the HMAC, while the low 16 bits are the
authentication code that comes from the
MD5 of the shared secret.
</p>

<p>
The 32-bit authentication code for stealth-only mode is calculated with
one round of MD5 using the shared secret along with the destination IP address
and port.  In stealth+integrity mode, the client and server must agree on
the number of payload bytes to be covered by the HMAC, which also uses MD5.  A
short <a href="https://gnunet.org/sites/default/files/knock.pdf">paper
[PDF]</a> about Knock noted that using MD5 may be something of a surprise,
but that it is already used by the kernel for initial TCP sequence number
calculation as well as for <tt>SYN</tt> cookies.
But in the linux-kernel mailing list thread, Jacob Appelbaum (who assisted
in the design of Knock) was <a href="/Articles/577400/">not particularly
happy</a> with the choice of MD5:
<div class="BigQuote">
If we believe that MD5 is not secure, we should not use it. That others
use it is not a strong reason to use it. Everyone should stop using MD5
- especially truncated MD5. :)
</div>
 
<p>
The stealth-only mode is vulnerable to replay attacks as a man in the
middle can observe the proper sequence number to unlock the port and
replicate it in their own packets (without knowing the secret).  Stealth-only is
also vulnerable to brute force attacks (trying all possible sequence
numbers), but that could be expensive in terms of time and it is not
particularly stealthy, so the attack might well be noticed.  The
stealth+integrity mode is more resistant, as the 
HMAC-protected bytes could be used to transfer a public key that is used to
encrypt the rest of the data.
</p>

<p>
There are some other downsides to the idea that were briefly explored in
the thread.  For one thing, network address translation (NAT)
implementations that change the sequence number in the <tt>SYN</tt> packet
will not work at all with this technique.  As David Miller <a
href="/Articles/577402/">pointed out</a>, sequence number alteration is
done in netfilter for tracking the SIP and FTP protocols as well as
for virtual server load balancing.
</p>

<p>
Others were more explicitly suggesting that handling this kind of port
knocking (or, seemingly, any kind of port knocking) would be best done
outside of the TCP core—in user space.  Both <a
href="/Articles/577405/">Stephen Hemminger</a> and <a
href="/Articles/577406/">Andi Kleen</a> suggested that user space was a
better home for the code.  But Grothoff, who signed off on the patch and
posted it, was <a href="/Articles/577410/">surprised</a> by that attitude:
"<q>I mean, if this was a patch for GNU Hurd, 
I'd at least understand the strong urge to do everything in
userspace</q>". Kleen, though, <a href="/Articles/577411/">noted</a>
that keeping port knocking in user space meant that "<q>the risk of adding exploitable holes to the kernel is [significantly]
lower</q>".
</p>

<p>
Eric Dumazet was also <a href="/Articles/577419/">critical</a> of the
idea.  He suggested allowing user space to implement parts of the TCP
protocol, which would also help other proposals (like <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0463">TCP Minion</a>):
<div class="BigQuote">
With various proposals (like TCP minion), maybe its time to be able to
implement part of TCP stack in user land (Keep the mux inside the
kernel, and forward raw incoming packets to user land where all the
crazy things can be done without kernel patching.)
</div>
</p>

<p>
Dumazet is also <a href="/Articles/577426/">concerned</a> that reusing
the initial sequence number (ISN) will make it difficult for servers to
distinguish duplicated packets.  He didn't mention it, but duplicate ISNs
(i.e. the sequence number sent with the <tt>SYN</tt>) might also make the
port knocking more obvious to a man in the middle.  Overall, though, Dumazet
felt that the paper was too short to explore the idea: "<q>You really need more than 3 pages to fully investigate all the pros/cons
of this idea.</q>"

<p>
He also hinted at a possible direction for getting Knock upstream: looking
at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp_fast_open">TCP fast open</a>,
which is somewhat similar and was merged into the mainline.  If Knock could
be more like fast open, or use it directly, it might have more of a chance
to be added to the networking core.  The concerns raised by Dumazet and
others are reflections of the complexity of the networking stack, that
there are a lot of moving parts all of which need to work well together.
That's part of the reasoning behind relegating features like port knocking
to user space.

<p>
On the other hand,
Grothoff is <a href="/Articles/577420/">not convinced</a> that the small
patch he posted "<q>really warrants moving TCP into
user land</q>".  But the reception from core network developers like
Miller, Hemminger, and Dumazet would seem to make it fairly unlikely the
patch will make it into the kernel.  Working on ways to either move some
pieces of TCP handling into user space or to extend netfilter to allow for
both silent knocking and payload protection would likely be the best way
forward. It <i>is</i> an interesting idea, though not without flaws, but
getting it into the kernel itself is going to be an uphill battle.

I'll plug my implementation (which uses a little bit of userspace but where the actual opening of ports is purely in-kernel): <a href="http://roland.entierement.nu/blog/2008/08/19/netfilter-based-port-knocking.html">http://roland.entierement.nu/blog/2008/08/19/netfilter-ba...</a><br>

Maybe at some point I'll make it more polished and distributable.  In the meantime, as you said, free software and so on.  Also, yes, I know, it doesn't protect from MITM (although the attack window can be made arbitrarily short).<br>

One of the requirements of Moxie Marlinspike's (Thoughtcrime) port knock implementation [1] was<br>
<p>
"I don't want something that runs in the kernel."<br>
<p>
Sadly there's no explanation but one would guess he's against the added complexity of having something in the kernel.<br>
<p>
FWIW, I've tried quite a few port knock implementations over the years (but not Marlinspike's one, which is on my todo list for months); I've eventually settled on a custom solution: since I'm running a web server anyway, I've set up an https restricted area with a cgi-bin that writes my IP/username to a temporary file. The firewall wgets the file every minute and adds/removes stuff with iptables's xt_recent. Works perfectly.<br>

For ISN, if your connection rate is low, it seems like you could mix a low resolution version of the current time in the hash calculation.  Allow a small range of ISNs in a defined "acceptance" interval.</P>
<P>Downside is that you need moderately accurate time on both sides of the link.</P>
<P>I can't claim this as a new idea.  The two-factor authentication scheme I use at work basically uses this principle.  The client generates a time-based token locally based on a shared secret and the current time.  That token is good for 30 seconds.  I use that token in addition to my username and password to log in.</P>
<P>It seems like a similar idea would work to "randomize" the ISN in a useful way.</P>

By itself, a hash of the shared secret and time won't protect against a replay attack within a short time frame (like right after observing the original port knocking sequence). However, if you added in some information about the connection, like the source IP address and port, that would frustrate replay attacks from other systems. Of course, the downside of that is that it would no longer be compatible with NAT.<br>

If the server responds to the knocks with an ICMP error, it might be possible to piggyback some challenge data in the response so that each sequence is unique after the first knock. The client would hash the challenge data with the shared secret to determine the next knock.<br>

Yeah, that's true.  Of course, if you do happen to save some state server side, then you could detect a replay attack.  Adding 'time' to the equation limits the length of the memory you need to have to the time window each token's valid.<br>

The idea of moving TCP into userland is neither crazy nor new.  It has been explored for years in (research) exokernels.  There's a lot of very interesting research and potential performance gains, which I'd love to see become more mainstream.<br>

.. and by "become more mainstream" I mean, be explored in real, production kernels.  Of course the promising results of research may fail in the real world, but we'd have to try it to find out if that is the case.<br>

The Tor Project also wants to have their own TCP stack to avoid OS fingerprinting based on the different stacks.<br>

<p>
There is no shortage of parallel, distributed filesystems available in
Linux today. 
Each have their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their advocates and use
cases.  <a href="http://www.orangefs.org/">Orange File System</a> (or
OrangeFS) is another; it is targeted at providing high I/O performance on
systems with up to
several thousand multicore storage nodes, but the project is planning to support millions of cores eventually.  The OrangeFS client code
was <a
href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems/92078">proposed</a>
for the Linux kernel back in January.  Walt Ligon, one of the principals
behind the filesystem, gave a talk about OrangeFS at the <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/vault">Vault conference</a>
back in March.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the talk, Ligon noted that OrangeFS was similar "in some
ways" to <a href="http://www.gluster.org/">GlusterFS</a>, which was
the subject of an earlier <a href="/Articles/637437/">Vault
presentation</a>.  But OrangeFS grew out of a research project from 1993
called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Virtual_File_System">Parallel
Virtual File System</a> (PVFS).  That filesystem (now in version 2, called
PVFS2) is in use today by various commercial organizations as well as by
universities. In 2008, the PVFS project was renamed to OrangeFS as part of
changing its 
focus to a more general filesystem for "big data".
</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>
At its core, OrangeFS has a client-server architecture, most of which runs
in user space.  All of the code is available under the LGPL. There are multiple
ways for client systems to use the PVFS protocol to access data on the
servers.  That includes libpvfs2 for low-level access, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface#I.2FO">MPI-IO</a>,
<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">Filesystem in Userspace</a> (FUSE),
web-related mechanisms (e.g. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>),
and a Linux virtual filesystem 
(VFS) client implementation for mounting OrangeFS like any other filesystem in
Linux.  The latter is what is being proposed for upstream inclusion.
</p>

<p>
OrangeFS servers handle objects, called dataspaces, that can have both
byte-stream and key-value components.  The "Trove" subsystem
determines how to store those components.  Currently, the byte streams are
stored as files on the underlying filesystem, while the key-value data is
mostly stored in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB">Berkeley
DB</a> files, though there is starting to be some use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database">LMDB</a>.
</p>

<p>

<a href="/Articles/643411/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2015/vault-orangefs-diag-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5
align="right" alt="[File structure diagram]" width=400 height=225>
</a>

As seen in the diagram at right, files are stored as a collection of
objects: a metadata object and one or 
more distributed file ("Dfile") objects.  Those are accessed from directory
objects that include a metadata object.  Each of those point to various DirData
objects, which contain Dirent (directory entry) objects that point
to the metadata object 
of a file.
</p>
<p>
Instead of blocks, OrangeFS is all about objects and leaves the block
mapping to the underlying filesystems.  There are no metadata servers, as
all servers can handle all kinds of requests.  It is possible to configure
an OrangeFS filesystem to store its metadata separate from its data using
parameters that govern how the objects should be distributed.
Files are typically striped across multiple servers to facilitate parallel
access. 
</p>

<p>
OrangeFS provides a unified namespace, so that all files are
accessible from a single mount point.  It has a client
protocol that supports lots of parallel clients and servers.  That
provides "high aggregate throughput", Ligon said.
</p>

<p>
In the past, users wanted MPI-IO access to files, but that has
changed.  Now, POSIX access is "what everyone wants to use".  They want to
be able to write Python scripts to access their data.  But the POSIX API
"can be a 
real limiting factor" because it doesn't understand parallel files,
striping, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Another of the goals for OrangeFS is to "enable the future" by being
flexible about the underlying technologies it uses.  It wants to provide
ways to swap in new redundancy, availability, and stability techniques.
For example, OrangeFS is designed to allow users to use their own
distribution equation, which is used to find and store data.  That equation
allows the system to determine which servers go with each object. 
</p>

<p>
Another goal is to make OrangeFS grow to "<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exascale_computing">exascale</a>".  One
way to keep increasing storage is to add more disks to the computer, but
that will eventually hit a wall.  There is not enough bandwidth and compute

<a href="/Articles/643275/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2015/vault-ligon-sm.jpg" border=0 hspace=5 align="left"
alt="[Walt Ligon]" title="Walt Ligon" width=206 height=260>
</a>

power within a system to access all that data with reasonable performance;
the solution to that 
problem is to add more computers into the mix.  
</p>

<p>
That dramatically increases the number of cores accessing the data, but you
can only increase the amount of storage per server to a certain point.
Just as with the single computer system above, various limits will be hit,
so a better solution is to add more servers with more network connections,
but that can get costly.  In an attempt to build a lower-cost alternative,
Ligon has a new project to create, say, 500 
storage servers, each using a Raspberry Pi with a disk.  It will be much
cheaper, but he thinks it will also be faster—though he still needs to
prove that.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of planned OrangeFS attributes that are missing from the
discussion so far, he 
said.  For example, 
with a large enough number of servers and disks, there will be failures
every day.  Even if there are no failures, systems will need to be taken
down to update the operating system or other software, so there is a need
for features that provide availability.
</p>

<p>
Security is a "major issue" that has mostly
been dealt with using "chewing gum and string", Ligon said.  Data integrity
is another important attribute, as the stored data must be periodically
checked and repaired.  There is also a need for ways to redistribute files
and objects for load or space reasons, as well as a need for monitoring and
administration tools.
</p>

<h4>OrangeFS V3</h4>

<p>
Some of the "core values" for the next major version of OrangeFS (3.0 or V3) are
directly targeted at solving those problems.  At the top of that list
is "parallelism"; the filesystem should allow parallel access to files,
directories, and metadata, while providing scalability through adding
servers.   The filesystem should also recognize that things are going to
fail regularly.  If a copy goes bad, throw it away and recreate it;
if a node fails, simply discard and replace it.
</p>

<p>
OrangeFS V3 will minimize the dependencies between servers by not sharing
state between them.  That will allow servers to be added and removed as
needed.  Avoiding locks is key to providing better performance, which may
require relaxing the semantics of some operations.  Finally, 3.0 will
target flexible site-customization policies for things like object placement,
replication, migration, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
In order to do all of that, OrangeFS will change the PVFS handle that has been
used to identify objects.  It is a 64-bit value that encodes both the
object and the server it lives on.  That scheme has a number of
limitations.  Objects cannot migrate or be replicated and the collection of
servers is static.  That works well up to around 128 static servers, he
said, but it
won't work for OrangeFS&nbsp;V3.
</p>

<p>
The new handles will contain both an object ID and one or more server IDs,
both of which will be 128-bit values.  The number of server IDs will
typically be somewhere between two and four that will be set
 when the filesystem is created; it can change, but in practice rarely
will.   These handles are internal-only, typically stored in metadata
objects.  By making this change, OrangeFS&nbsp;V3 will be able to do
replication and migration.
</p>

<p>
This will allow all of the filesystem structure to be replicated, as well
as the 
file data. A set of back references is also created, so
that maintenance operations can find other copies of the structures.

Each of those pieces and copies could be stored on different
servers if that was desired.  Another possibility is to use "file
stuffing", which places the first data object on the same server as its
metadata object. 
</p>

<p>
Reads can be done from any server that has a copy of the object, while
writes are done to the primary object.  Its server then initiates the copy
(or copies) needed for replication.  The write will
only complete and return to the client after a certain number of copies
have completed.  This is known as the "write confidence" required.  For
example, if one copy is sent to a much slower archive device, the write
could complete after all or some of the non-archive copies have completed. 
</p>

<p>
V3 adds a server ID database, rather than a fixed set of servers.  That
allows dynamic addition of servers with site-defined attributes
(e.g. number, building, rack, etc.).  A client doesn't have to know about all
the servers, only the set it is using.  Servers maintain a partial list of
other servers that they tend to work with and there is a server resolution
protocol to find others as needed.
</p>


<p>
The security model is already present in OrangeFS&nbsp;2.9 (which is the
current version of the filesystem).  The model is based
around capabilities that get returned based on the credentials presented
when a metadata object is accessed.  That capability is then passed when
accessing the data objects.  Certificates and public/private key pairs are
used to authenticate clients and their credentials.
</p>

<p>
The final OrangeFS feature that Ligon described was the "parallel
background jobs" (PBJs) that are used for maintenance and data integrity.
They can be run to check the integrity of the data stored and to repair
problems that are found.  They can also handle tasks like rebalancing where
data is stored to avoid access hotspots and the like.
</p>

<p>
As he said at the outset, Ligon's talk provided a high-level overview of
the filesystem.  It seems to not be a particularly well known filesystem,
but one that has some interesting attributes.  Beyond just handling
large data sets for parallel computation, it is also targeted as a research
platform that can be used to test ideas for enhancements or broad
restructuring.  The kernel patches did not receive any comments, but they
are also fairly small (less than 10,000 lines of code), so it seems
plausible that we will see an OrangeFS client land in the mainline sometime in
the future.

I saw the in Linux kernel 4.6 release notes that an OrangeFS driver is now included, and have spent the last hour reading up on OrangeFS. A shame this article didn't pop up in my search results earlier, it answers a lot of questions.<br>
<p>
I was most interested in the OrangeFS claim that  "using OrangeFS instead of HDFS ... can improve MapReduce performance and ...". Having spent significant time with Hadoop and HDFS, I wanted to look into it.<br>
<p>
As this article makes clear, however, OrangeFS has a significant way to go to catch up with HDFS in features, and I suspect performance as well. The list of things "intended for OrangeFS 3.x" are all things that HDFS already implements:<br>
* allow parallel access<br>
* provide scalability through adding servers<br>
* if a copy goes bad, throw it away and recreate it<br>
* replication and migration<br>
<p>
Of course there are things OrangeFS can do which HDFS does not. Nevertheless, the OrangeFS website should perhaps be a little more humble in their comparison with HDFS - and maybe think about borrowing some of its ideas rather than reimplementing the wheel for their version 3.<br>

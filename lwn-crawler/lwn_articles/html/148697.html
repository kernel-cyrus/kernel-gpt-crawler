<h1>Linux and TCP offload engines</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted August 22, 2005 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
The TCP/IP protocol suite takes a certain amount of CPU power to
implement.  So it is not surprising that network adapter manufacturers have
long been adding protocol support to their cards.  This support can vary
from the simple (checksumming of packets, for example) through to full
TCP/IP implementations.  An adapter with full protocol support is often
called a TCP offload engine or TOE.
<p>

Linux has never supported the TOE features of any network cards.  For some
time, there had not even been much discussion of TOE support.  The topic
has returned, however, with <a href="/Articles/147289/">this patch adding TOE
support</a> which was posted by Scott Bardone of Chelsio Communications.
This TOE patch is clearly intended to support Chelsio's line of network
adapters, but it has been coded as a more generic "open TOE" framework.
The Chelsio folks would very much like to see this patch merged for the
2.6.14 kernel release.
<p>

Those who are curious about the TOE patch can go in and look at the code;
it is relatively straightforward.  At its core, it creates a new type of
extended network device (<tt>struct toedev</tt>) with an additional set of
methods:
<p>
<pre>
	int (*open)(struct toedev *dev);
	int (*close)(struct toedev *dev);
	int (*can_offload)(struct toedev *dev, struct sock *sk);
	int (*connect)(struct toedev *dev, struct sock *sk);
	int (*send)(struct toedev *dev, struct sk_buff *skb);
	int (*recv)(struct toedev *dev, struct sk_buff **skb, int n);
	int (*ctl)(struct toedev *dev, unsigned int req, void *data);
	void (*neigh_update)(struct net_device *lldev,
			     struct toedev *dev,
			     struct neighbour *neigh, int fl);
</pre>
<p>
There are various hooks sprinkled through the TCP code to detect when a
TOE-capable device is being used and call the appropriate method rather
than performing the TCP processing in the kernel.  One assumes that the
patch works as advertised, but its chances of getting into the kernel
appear to be relatively small.  There is a very long list of objections
which have been raised, including:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The TOE code must, by necessity, hook deeply into the Linux TCP 
     implementation.  These hooks will make it harder to make high-level
     TCP changes in the future.  The TOE patch thus represents a long-term
     maintenance burden.
<p>
<li> TOE shorts out much of the Linux networking code.  In the process, it
     cuts out little features like netfilter, traffic control, and more.
     So a Linux system using TOE will lack many of the capabilities which
     characterize the Linux networking stack.  The networking hackers can
     already foresee the interminable series of "why doesn't my TOE adapter
     support netfilter?" questions which will go their way.
<p>
<li> The Linux networking stack is easy to fix when a bug or security issue
     comes up.  If a security problem turns up in a TOE adapter, instead, there is
     very little which can be done to fix it.
<p>
<li> The performance benefits from TOE are minimal at best.  Even if a TOE
     adapter and software stack currently outperforms "dumber" adapters for
     very high networking speeds (10G currently, say), that advantage tends
     to disappear by the time those speeds are in common use.  Jeff Garzik
     <a href="/Articles/148700/">claims</a> that 100Mb/s TOE adaptors
     (which used to be the bleeding-edge high speed) are now slower than
     the Linux networking stack.  So any performance advantage from TOE is
     a temporary thing, but, once it is merged, the code must be supported
     forever. 
</ul>
<p>

There is also the inconvenient little detail that a company called
Alacritech owns <a
href="http://www.taborcommunications.com/dsstar/04/0817/108758.html">several
patents</a> relating to TOE.  It recently <a
href="http://www.eet.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=166401437">used
those patents</a> to extract money from Microsoft, which is including TOE
support in its upcoming Windows release.  This, alone, would almost
certainly cause distributors to disable TOE support, even if it were to
find its way into the kernel.  (For the record, Chelsio <a
href="/Articles/148790/">claims</a> to have done its legal homework, but
not everybody finds that claim to be convincing).
<p>
Will it find its way in?  Not if David Miller <a
href="/Articles/148701/">has anything to say</a> on the matter:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I am still very much against TOE going into the Linux networking
	stack.  There are ways to obtain TOE's performance without
	necessitating stateful support in the cards, everything that's
	worthwhile can be done with stateless offloads.
</div>
<p>
There is essentially zero chance of a networking patch being merged over
David's objections, so the TOE developers have an uphill road ahead of
them.
<p>
One might well ask: if TOE cannot be merged, how will Linux maintain
competitive speeds as networks get faster?  A big area of interest,
currently, is offloading parts of the protocol which do not require great
intelligence or state in the card.  The kernel already supports TCP
segmentation offloading (TSO), where an adapter can create TCP packets out
of a large array of data.  TSO reduces the necessary CPU power, bus
overhead, and cache impact to send a series of packets, but it still does
not require that the adapter actually know anything about specific TCP
connections.  There is talk of using a similar technique for incoming
packets: an adapter could merge a configurable set of incoming packets into
a single array, thus reducing the demands on the rest of the system.  One
way or another, the networking stack is likely to keep up with the demands
of current hardware.
<p>

It has often been said that a maintainer's real job is to say "no" to
patches.  Not all features are worth their (very real) cost, and merging
some patches can be detrimental to the kernel in the long run.  For years,
the networking maintainers have felt that TOE support is the kind of patch
which should not be accepted, and the current implementation appears not to
have changed their minds.  TOE appears to be one of those ideas which never
really goes away, however, so chances are good that we will see this debate
again in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      As always, the patch submitter must prove that the patch is necessary before it can be accepted.  I've seen a lot of TOE code flying around but so far no good performance numbers.<br>
<p>
I hope the TOE guys will plug a few gigE network cards into a dual Opteron setup and run a network benchmark (SpecWEB? ttcp?).  Then turn on TOE and check the speedup.  If it's better than 30% then I would support integrating TTCP into the kernel.  Short of that, I would jus wait the six months until computing hardware closes the gap, or add another machine.  I'm skeptical that TOE will even get 30%.<br>
<p>
So...  Have any reliable numbers been produced yet?<br>

      <p>At 10Gbps the issue is not the speed so much as the networking stack using so much of the CPU as the computer has too little user space CPU left to do anything much useful.  That's what TOEs address.</p>

<p>Also note that the choice isn't about offload, but the amount of state the offload needs and provides. For example, an offload which allowed the important TCP control decisions to be made by the CPU would allow most of the advances in the Linux kernel whilst not increasing CPU load overly (since connections rarely alter rate or state). A TSO which played out at a specified rate would be extremely useful.</p>

<p>You are right, the stack can always revert to using the CPU when a feature which requires it is configured. But any network engineer that has used a router which radically drops its throughput when you innocently alter the configuration  can tell you how frustrating this design choice can be.</p>

<p>There must be a way of manually disabling the TOE, just as other offloads can be manually disabled now. That just isn't useful for security, but for fault finding, resilience and running with known bugs (eg, the TSO feature was not compliant with congestion control needs in some kernel versions).</p>

<p>What concerns me more about Linux networking software is that the developers are getting fine results using ttcp and iperf but users that want to do large file transfers (ie, something useful as well as shunting about packets) are getting numbers typically around 300Mbps. The users have too few tools allowed for by the kernel for tracking down the source of their poor performance.  It's a major exercise in patch application to get simple data like the amount of CPU and I/O used by kernel subsystems; or to get TCP's view of the performance of the network and remote host.</p>

      note that TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) has extensive support in the 2.6 Linux kernel, and been supported for a long time. All the network hardware that is capable of doing TSO has native Linux driver support for it: tg3, e1000, ixgb, s2io, bnx2, qeth, tg3, 8139cp - you name it.<br>
<p>
so the fundamental question is the basic question that the network maintainers always stressed, and which this open letter does not address at all: how does TOE compare to TSO. I.e. the issue is indeed what you stated too: not whether to offload, but how much state to offload.<br>
<p>
so any attempt to try to mischaracterise this whole issue as some "unwillingness of the Linux networking maintainers to integrate TOE" is misguided at best.<br>

      Objections nr 2 and 3 are not very good objections at all. IANAKH (I am not a kernel hacker) but: A more intelligent patch would just fall back on the Linux stack, if it recognizes that netfilter or something else is being used. Similarly, if a TOE card is found to be vulnerable, a security update would just remove that card from the list of TOE cards.
<br><br>
Objection nr 4 is the important one. Adding more code to the kernel without any performance benefit would obviously be silly. If the authors of the patch have done their homework, they will have benchmarks to start the discussion with.

      Another counter-argument is that TOE hide problems: several times already a 'slow network' turned out to be a semi-broken one. The fact that  'netstat -ni' showed no errors at all until TOE was turned off make finding the problem rather difficult; not even tcpdump could see the retransmissions, only a packet leaving and arriving a _long_ time later.<br>
Standard procedure now is to turn off TOE until a proven need is determined.<br>

      <p>Something I've always wondered about TCP offload and every other kind of offload:  Is it better to add CPU power to a network adapter than to add it to the motherboard?  Adding it to the motherboard (faster CPU chip, more SMP CPUs) is certainly simpler, which ought to mean cheaper.  Are there technological limits that make it impossible for a single SMP complex to handle all the 10 Gbps packets and all the higher level stuff too?
<p>
Sometimes, people add intelligence to the periphery of a system in order to make things more simple by allowing the central processor to remain blissfully ignorant of what's going on out there.  But since TCP offload actually requires the central processor to cooperate, this doesn't fit that pattern.

      I know very little about this, but I think the two things you gain are the ability to make hardware specifically to handle the kinds of calculations (think GPU, FPU, DSP etc) and the ability to concentrate on the data without having to deal with things like interrupts and memory management (polling).<br>
<p>
In the case of TOE, I imagine that there are checksums and so on that could be performed whilst dmaing the data through.  If this were done by the main CPU it might be that the data arrives much slower than the CPU could handle them, but faster than is suitable for interrupts.  So the driver has to do the checksum on a block of data after it is in main memory, effectively doubling the time spend on each packet.  The card could just compute the checksum as it does the dma transfer, and leave that somewhere convenient.<br>
<p>
I remember that back in the days of the 68k macs they used a separate 6801 or similar to handle the io, as that reduced the time spent in interrupts drastically, without requiring a much more powerful CPU.<br>

      I have to wonder if Chelsio has had this patch out long enough for them to <br>
understand what FAQs pop up as a result (e.g., netfilter not working, <br>
performance) as well as identifying how much work it takes to maintain it <br>
over time, and whether it's reasonable to expect the kernel core <br>
developers to just pick it up. <br>
 <br>
Albeit with zero facts, I suspect that the patch may have been submitted <br>
without having been tested in their customers' environments over a few <br>
linux kernel releases.  From this, Chelsio would get a first feel for <br>
FAQs, continuous maintenance, etc., and even viability in their own <br>
customers' environments (e.g., "no netfilter? Screw it, we'll turn TOE off <br>
in that case").  Also, it would be interesting to see how the BSD folks' <br>
responses would compare if this patch was submitted to them. <br>
         <br>
Finally, it seems that some kind of committee for discussing kernel&lt;-&gt;TOE <br>
integration and use issues would make sense prior to tossing a patch <br>
implementing an 'Open TOE' interface out there. <br>

I've heard it does fine with 100G CX4 Mellanox cards, but that depends on the use case.<br>

<p>
BPF is in a unique position in terms of security. It runs in a privileged
context, within the kernel, and can have access to many sensitive details of the
kernel's operation. At the same time, unlike kernel modules, BPF programs aren't signed.
Additionally, the mechanisms behind BPF present challenges to implementing
signing or other security features. Three nearly back-to-back sessions at the
2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>
addressed some of the potential security problems.
</p>

<h4>Signing</h4>

<p>
The first session, led by KP Singh, dealt with the problem of validating signed BPF
programs â€” although Singh preferred to call them "trusted", since the signature
is only a representaton of that fact. It is difficult to verify a signed BPF
program, because they are transformed in several ways prior to being loaded. A
user-space loading program reads a BPF ELF file from disk and then performs
relocations on it, to prepare it to run. These relocations are the mechanism
behind BPF's "compile once - run everywhere" (CO-RE) support.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/977792">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/kp-singh-small.png"
class="lthumb"
alt="[KP Singh]" title="KP Singh"
>
</a>

<p>
Unfortunately, CO-RE means that by the time the kernel sees the program, it has
been altered by user space in a way that would invalidate any signatures. Even
if the initial ELF file were signed, the version of the program sent to the
kernel for loading would not match. Singh's answer to this problem is to use a
trusted BPF loader. There are existing mechanisms to check that programs haven't
been altered, notably
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fsverity.html">
fs-verity</a>. If the kernel only accepts BPF programs
from trusted user-space programs that are themselves signed, included on an
fs-verity protected filesystem the kernel trusts, or verified in some other
way, and <em>those</em> programs verify BPF programs in some way before
loading them, then everything should remain secure. Singh shared a demo of a
simple loader that verifies BPF programs using fs-verity, to demonstrate that
the idea was workable.
</p>

<p>
There are some complications with this approach, though. For one, as the recent
<a href="/Articles/967192/">
XZ backdoor</a> illustrated, dynamically loaded programs are not safe unless all of
their dynamic dependencies are safe. Therefore, Singh recommended that trusted
BPF loaders be statically linked. Possibly a dynamically linked program could be
safe if all of the necessary libraries were also signed, but for his use case, a
statically linked loader is simpler. One member of the audience objected to
that, saying that systemd has started to use BPF, is interested in signing,
but can't really be made to use a static binary. Singh acknowledged that there
were good reasons to allow dynamic linking, but that it wasn't something he
had thought about in depth. Regardless of static or dynamic linking, the
important thing is that the entire path from disk to a loaded BPF program must
be trusted, he said.
</p>

<p>
Neill Kapron led a later session that challenged Singh's approach. Kapron works on
Android, which has a vested interest in ensuring that the operating system can
start from a trusted image. The project's current approach is to use a trusted
loader, early in boot, to load any necessary BPF programs, but Kapron would like
to move away from that.
</p>

<p>
BPF is used for several different purposes in Android, he said, and networking,
system, and vendor BPF programs all have their own separate update and release
timelines. Currently, the complexity of running BPF programs from multiple
sources across multiple kernel versions is handled using an android-specific BPF
library. Kapron would like to switch to upstream libbpf instead, but can't do so
until there's an answer to the security problems around loading BPF.
</p>

<p>
Kapron considered several approaches, including a single trusted loader, signed
shared library objects for libbpf, a "relocation playbook", and several others.
Eventually, he settled on a different approach: moving the loading of BPF
programs into the kernel.
If relocations could be performed in the kernel, then the bytes read from disk
could be signed using fs-verity, which would let the kernel ensure they had not
been tampered with as long as the file system itself is trusted. Kapron suggested an
approach where a user-space program could present a file descriptor to a file on
an fs-verity filesystem and the kernel would handle the rest.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot of support needed in the kernel for that, however. The kernel
already knows how to open and read some parts of an ELF file, but the parser
would need to be extended to other parts of the file format. The kernel would
need to be able to create the BPF maps a program calls for, perform the
relocations, and handle CO-RE. This is made more difficult because "we don't
have a standard for the ELF format", Kapron explained. The existing BPF format
is an ad-hoc contract between the user-space loader and the compiler. So libbpf
has documented some aspects, but other libraries could do things differently.
One audience member volunteered that the
<a href="https://go.dev/">
Go project</a> is changing its BPF loader to align
with what libbpf does, so it might actually be a de-facto standard.
</p>

<p>
Kapron listed some benefits of moving BPF loading into the kernel, noting that
it would solve the problem of different BPF libraries having different loading
behaviors, enable fully verified boots, and could even be used to permit
BPF preloading â€” where BPF files are embedded directly into the kernel during
the build.
</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>
Ensuring that BPF programs are not tampered with before loading was only one of the
security topics discussed in the BPF track. Maxwell Bland led a session
discussing other security concerns around the BPF subsystem.
Bland listed verification bugs, exploit
chaining, and unprivileged misuse. Verification bugs can be relevant for
security because BPF depends on the verifier to ensure BPF programs' access to
kernel memory is safe. Exploit chaining refers to attacks that use a program or
tool to set up the next stage of an attack, rather than attacking the program or
tool directly. For example, rather than targeting BPF itself, such attacks
might try to use BPF to store the payload for a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_spraying">
heap-spray attack</a> into kernel
memory. And unprivileged misuse refers to user programs that take advantage of
intended BPF features in a way that lets them exceed imposed limits.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/977794">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/maxwell-bland-small.png"
class="lthumb"
alt="[Maxwell Bland]" title="Maxwell Bland"
>
</a>

<p>
There is one potential problem that Bland paid particular attention to:
modifying BPF programs as they are being loaded. There are only three kernel
subsystems (not counting any possible modules) that violate the assumption that
pages containing executable code have never been writable in the past,
Bland said: BPF, kprobe self-patching, and the kernel's fixed map. These are not
violations of a "write xor execute" policy, because no page in the kernel is
ever simultaneously writable and executable. But if an exploit can write to a
page before it is made executable, that is nearly as good.
</p>

<p>
For BPF, this means that exploits might try to exploit other write-gadgets
(parts of existing code that can be misused to write to memory) in
the kernel to overwrite a page while the just-in-time (JIT) compiler is also
writing to it. This isn't something that can be fixed with changes to the
verifier or cryptographic signatures, because it targets BPF after those stages.
There are potential mitigations, however. Bland suggested reserving memory
ranges for BPF programs that don't overlap with the rest of kernel memory to
make it harder for attackers to write to the pages while they're vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
That idea isn't a complete solution, however, because it introduces a lot of
complexity for memory management. Also, there's a limit to how much memory
can be reserved for BPF. As with other proposals to increase security by carving
up the kernel's memory, it can be difficult to judge what the correct size to
allocate is. Bland did say that Mike Rapoport was working on
<a href="/Articles/933867/">a change related to this</a>.
</p>

<p>
Bland summarized some related next steps for making "write then
execute" scenarios harder to exploit, although not all of the proposals impacted
BPF. Puranjay Mohan has
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20240324211518.93892-1-puranjay12@gmail.com/">
a patch set</a> improving control-flow-integrity (CFI) protections
on aarch64. Bland hopes to see LLVM's CFI hashing algorithm improved. Finally, there
are plans to add more security monitoring for uses of the kernel's fixed map in EROFS.
</p>

<p>
BPF's verifier already lets the kernel track many security properties, but now
BPF developers are looking at what will be necessary to continue securing BPF
programs both before the verifier (with signing) and afterward. Security is an
ever-changing field; it seems likely that there will be more to report on all of
these initiatives in time.

Honestly, this feels like a step backward from what I'd call a good OS design.<br>
<p>
Every once in a while a question of trusting specific parts of userspace comes up â€” and the answer to that question is invariably "let's stick it into the kernel" (with the assumption that everything in the kernel is trusted). I'm afraid this is not a sustainable approach.<br>

      <p>I like the compromise the DRM subsystem takes for GPUs; the kernel verifies that the stuff from userspace can only access resources the sender already has access to via other means, and not other parts of the system, but otherwise does not interpret the information being sent into the kernel.
<p>If userspace wants to ask the GPU to trash the current process's memory, that's fine (and it should also be fine for a BPF program to trash memory belonging to processes you can ptrace, for example). But you can't use the kernel interface to bypass the kernel's security mechanisms; if you ask the kernel to alter PID 1's memory, and an LSM or traditional permissions would say "no", then the BPF program (or whatever) should be rejected.
<p>This sort of "verify that you're not breaching security barriers, then trust" seems to be a reasonable compromise; it doesn't matter if the userspace turns out untrustworthy, since it can only do damage that it could already do by some other means.

Let me propose a (not entirely serious) solution to that (I don't know whether it was one of the mentioned potential mitigations): just run the JIT twice. Once before protecting, writing to the page, and once more after protecting, reading from the page and comparing instead of writing. If the comparison fails, panic the kernel. (Of course, that would depend on the JIT being deterministic.) And if you want to protect against someone somehow running code on the page before it has been checked, make the page executable only after the comparison ends.<br>

This is an awesome comment, and that did end up being sort of the solution for the Android case!<br>
<p>
Since the only runtime-loaded BPF programs on Android presently are SECCOMP policy filters, and these are cBPF and not eBPF, and it is (pretty) straightforward to do what you suggest and run a machine-code level purity test on cBPF programs after after (or simultaneous to) marking them executable at EL2 or EL1!<br>

Note that this implementation is buggy and not totally generic. It only supports one-page programs, iirc. I was quick to learn chrome has multi-page cBPF load-ins when working on a deployed implementation. <br>
<p>
I was able to get a stable implementation working with a couple of changes to the above on Motorola phones, and am trying my best to release a fuller, open-source, permissively licensed, and modular (as in kernel module) for hardening against Qualys 2021-style (and other) attacks in the next few months.<br>
<p>
Not an excuse, but explanation for the delay, since I want to put my code where my mouth is: I am *still* dealing with Snapdragon processors page table (and memory caching) management months later. -_- ! The hoops the Gen 8 series needs you to jump through just to perform an SMC call are bogus IMO. E.g. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/refs/tags/android-13.0.0_r0.71/drivers/firmware/qcom_scm-64.c#150">https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/refs/tags/a...</a> : you're telling me if I want to transition to EL2 to register a protection, I have to have a retry count? What if it never succeeds, and that is a critical security operation? What the heck! (-:<br>
<p>
The tl;dr is a good executable code verifier sort of needs to also hook into/watch each task's allocated PGD and sub-tables during fork.c's duplication of the mm_struct, which is totally doable, but hardware specific nonsense makes it an engineering struggle, so it is taking me a while to get the code out there (my testing devices are all snapdragon chipsets).<br>

I wonder. Is this done as a way to sidestep the GPL license and not release them, where modules need to be released instead?<br>
<p>
It might also be because BPF interface is more stable than modules, so they are more durable across versions?<br>
<p>
I have no experience with linux kernel development, so I'm just wondering.<br>

<p>
But static dependencies are frozen at build time by the developer<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; In both cases, unless you audit all the dependencies, you don't know what might be running.</span><br>
<p>
And with dynamic loading, how CAN you audit all the dependencies? That's the point you're missing - an attacker can corrupt a dynamic dependency at run time, a static dependency can be audited by the developer.<br>

That horse has bolted. Not all modules are released as GPL or even Open Source! There's plenty of ways round it, this could just be one more. I think it's a safe bet manufacturers will find it hard to get closed-source bpf modules into distros, but it'll be user pressure not legal force.<br>
<p>

Right. Most of all of the endpoint "security" vendors like CrowdStrike, Vanta, SolarWinds, IBM etc seem to have very opaque and secret kernel modules that do god-knows-what to the system, for example.<br>

The BPF loader actually only loads programs that (claim to be) GPLv2 licensed. So in this case, embedded BPF is not likely to be a workaround for licensing. I believe the use case is for distribution kernels that want to include BPF programs, simplifying the kernel initialization process/distribution process.<br>

If scheduler development switches to normally compiling to BPF for schedulers people are using, it might then make sense for the default scheduler to be in BPF, but loaded before there are user space tasks. More generally, it would make sense for the policy you get until you load your custom policy to be qualitatively similar to the custom policies you could load, which suggests that the mainline kernel ought to compile some code to preloaded BPF instead of native code.<br>

Lustig, Boqun Feng, Joel Fernandes, Jade Alglave, and Luc Maranget. 

<p>
In <a href="/Articles/816850/">part 1</a> of this article, we gave an overview of the <a
href="https://github.com/google/ktsan/wiki/KCSAN">Kernel Concurrency
Sanitizer</a> (KCSAN) and looked how it can detect data races in the
kernel.  KCSAN uses the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt#n1922">definition</a>
of "data race" that is part of the
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt">Linux-Kernel
Memory Consistency Model</a> (LKMM), but there is more that KCSAN can do.
This concluding part of the article describes other ways that the tool can
be used to find data races and other kinds of problems in concurrent code.
It provides some ideas on strategies and best practices, briefly considers
some alternative approaches, and concludes with some known limitations. 

<h4>Applying KCSAN to different types of code</h4>

<p>
When dealing with data races, we need to be aware of the code's requirements
and purpose. Some code tolerates data races but other code does
not. Where that tolerance also results in improved scalability of the code
or design in question, the <tt>data_race()</tt> marking can be applied to
any expression where data races are intentional, thus documenting this fact
and also telling KCSAN that data races in the expression should be
ignored. 

<p>
The rest of this section discusses how to get the most out of KCSAN for different types of code.

<p>
Data-racy reads from shared variables that are used only for diagnostic
purposes should typically use <tt>data_race()</tt>, since it is normally
not a problem if the values are off by a little. Examples include the
reads used to construct lockdep reports, monitoring and statistics
(including <tt>/proc</tt> and <tt>/sys</tt> output), the argument to
<tt>WARN_ON_ONCE()</tt> when the return value is ignored, and other
situations where the reads are not in any way an integral part of the core
concurrency design for the shared variables in question. There are of
course exceptions to this rule.  For example, if user-space code requires
selected <tt>/sys</tt> output to give a coherent snapshot of in-kernel
state, then that output must be considered to be a first-class part of the
core concurrency design and must therefore use proper synchronization. 

<p>
Reads whose values are checked might also use <tt>data_race()</tt>. Examples include:
 
<ul class="spacylist">
	<li>Reads that are being fed only into <tt>cmpxchg()</tt> and
	friends (possibly with some computation on the way) such that
	<tt>cmpxchg()</tt> is guaranteed to fail if the compiler does
	anything unexpected with the load.  But please keep in mind that a
	<tt>data_race()</tt> load feeding into a <tt>cmpxchg_relaxed()</tt>
	might still be subject to <a
	href="/Articles/793253/#Load%20Fusing">load
	fusing</a> on some architectures. Therefore, it is best to capture
	the return value from the failing <tt>cmpxchg()</tt> for use in the
	next iteration of the loop, which provides the compiler much less
	scope for mischievous optimizations. This approach also saves a
	memory reference in many cases.</li> 

	<li>Reads within a sequence-locking read-side critical section,
	whose values are ignored unless the subsequent
	<tt>read_seqretry()</tt> returns false.  However,
	<tt>data_race()</tt> is only needed in sequence-locking read-side
	critical sections for reads that access variables updated outside
	of the corresponding write-side critical section.  Reads of
	variables updated only within the write-side critical section are
	automatically ignored by KCSAN, which understands and automatically
	recognizes sequence locks.</li> 

	<li>Reads that feed into heuristics, such that occasional errors
	are compensated for.  But again <tt>data_race()</tt> loads are
	still subject to load fusing, which can result in consistent
	errors, which in turn are quite capable of breaking
	heuristics.</li> 

	<li>If compilers are assumed never to <a
	href="/Articles/793253/#Invented%20Stores">invent
	stores</a> just prior to a normal store, then concurrent normal
	loads might be able to make some assumptions about the value
	loaded.  For example, kernel-space addresses typically have at least a
	few upper bits set because the low-numbered addresses are normally
	reserved for user space.  In such a system, a comparison to a
	<tt>NULL</tt> pointer will give the correct answer no matter how
	the compiler slices and dices the loads and stores.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
Reads from and writes to variables that are not supposed to be subject to
data races should use plain C-language reads and writes, thus enabling
KCSAN to flag bugs involving unintended (and thus likely buggy) data races.
Important categories of non-data-racy situations include: 

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li>Accesses protected by strict locking.</li>

	<li>Initialization- and cleanup-time accesses.  This covers a wide
	variety of situations, including the uniprocessor phase of system
	boot, variables to be used by not-yet-spawned kthreads, structures
	not yet published to reference-counted or RCU-protected data
	structures, and the cleanup side of each of these situations.</li> 

	<li>Per-CPU variables that are not supposed to be accessed from
	other CPUs.  This case occurs in RCU, for example.</li> 

	<li>Private per-task variables, including on-stack variables, some
	fields in the <tt>task_struct</tt> structure, and task-private heap
	data.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
As noted above, data-racy reads for diagnostic accesses to otherwise
data-race-free variables should use <tt>data_race()</tt>. The
non-diagnostic accesses should <b>not</b> be marked. After all, accesses to
data-race-free variables need to remain unmarked in order to allow KCSAN to
detect buggy concurrent accesses. 

<p>
Note that marking accesses racing with accesses marked <tt>data_race()</tt>
is optional, but for documentation purposes it is still recommended to do
so where appropriate. 

<p>
According to the strict LKMM data-race definition, other use cases should
use <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> or stronger for intentionally data-racy reads and
<tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> or stronger for intentionally data-racy writes.
However, there are exceptions depending on taste, and KCSAN can be
configured to suit: 

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li>Plain reads that race with writes that do not change the value
	of the shared variable can be forgiven by building with
	<tt>CONFIG_KCSAN_REPORT_VALUE_CHANGE_ONLY=y</tt> (selected by
	default).  This is useful in cases where a variable is compile-time
	initialized to (say) zero and then repeatedly set to (say) the
	value one during execution.  In such cases, the compiler would need
	to be rather demonic to load some other value other than one when
	running concurrently with a write that left the value unchanged.
	However, some developers might prefer to check the value so as to
	avoid same-value stores altogether, thus possibly also improving
	cache locality.</li> 

	<li>Unmarked writes (aligned and up to word size) can be treated as
	if they had used <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> by building with
	<tt>CONFIG_KCSAN_ASSUME_PLAIN_WRITES_ATOMIC=y</tt> (also selected
	by default). Experience has shown that compilers are much less
	likely to destructively optimize in-kernel writes than reads.  Some
	developers might therefore choose to use <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> but
	omit the corresponding <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>.  Other developers
	might prefer the documentation benefits and long-term peace of mind
	accruing from explicit use of <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>, <a
	href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190821103200.kpufwtviqhpbuv2n@willie-the-truck/">especially
	those developers whose code stores certain constants</a>.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
As before, accesses that are intended to be non-data-racy should use plain
C-language loads and stores, which allows KCSAN to find accesses that
violate your synchronization rules. 

<p>
Although KCSAN cannot directly detect unnecessary use of
<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> and <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>, one way of indirectly
detecting this is to remove the <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> or
<tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> from accesses that are suspected to be unnecessary,
and then run KCSAN using a benchmark that has high probability of
exercising the suspected race conditions. However, some care is required
given that the data raciness of a particular access might depend on
<tt>Kconfig</tt> options or kernel boot parameters and <tt>sysfs</tt>
settings. 

<p>
The list in this section represents best practices at this point in time.
Both KCSAN and the best practices surrounding its use can be expected to
change as we learn how best to use this data-race detector and
also as KCSAN evolves. 

<h4>Developer/Maintainer data-race strategies</h4>

<p>
An <a
href="/Articles/793253/#How%20Real%20Is%20All%20This?">earlier
article</a> described four approaches to applying markings for shared
variables, which can be paraphrased as follows: (1) Never, (2) Clear and
present bug, (3) Data races, and (4) Always.  The following list describes
how to use KCSAN for each option, and adds a fifth option that has resulted
from experience using KCSAN. 

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li><b>Never</b>: In this case, you may add
	"<tt>KCSAN_SANITIZE_file.o := n</tt>" to the respective
	<tt>Makefile</tt> (or "<tt>KCSAN_SANITIZE := n</tt>" for all
	targets in the <tt>Makefile</tt>). Note that data races between one
	access having KCSAN enabled, and the other not having it enabled, will result in a
	"race of unknown origin" report, pointing at the access for which
	KCSAN was enabled. If you do not want to see any such data races,
	set <tt>CONFIG_KCSAN_REPORT_RACE_UNKNOWN_ORIGIN=n</tt>.</li> 

	<li><b>For any access to any shared variable for which there is a
	possibility of a data race, and for which it can be clearly shown
	that specific compiler optimizations could result in bugs</b>:
	Analyze most KCSAN reports for vulnerability to compiler
	optimizations.  This is not a one-off task because data races that
	appear "benign" today, might not <a
	href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotpar11/tech/final_files/Boehm.pdf">remain
	benign [PDF]</a> in the future. It is up to the developer to prove that
	the compiler cannot break the code. When carrying out such proofs,
	whether formal or informal, please recall that plain C-language
	accesses are subject to load/store fusing, invented loads/stores,
	dead-code elimination, load/store tearing, and possibly other
	manipulations from clever compiler developers.  If a given data
	race is deemed to be benign, you can prevent KCSAN from complaining
	about it via the <tt>data_race()</tt> macro.  As long as all
	conflicting access are marked (either <tt>data_race()</tt> or
	<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>, etc.), KCSAN will be
	silent. Alternatively, tell KCSAN to ignore all accesses in a
	function via the <tt>__no_kcsan</tt> function attribute.</li> 

	<li><b>For any access to a shared variable for which there is a
	possibility of a data race for at least one of those accesses</b>:
	Enable the most aggressive KCSAN reporting and act on all KCSAN
	reports. All accesses to any shared variable involved in a KCSAN
	data race report needs to use any one of the appropriate marked
	atomic operations (<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>,
	etc., but avoid <tt>data_race()</tt> except in diagnostic
	code).</li> 

	<li><b>For all accesses to all shared variables</b>: KCSAN is a bit
	more forgiving than this, in that it only reports true concurrent
	access. However, most of the time, if KCSAN reports a data race on
	a shared variable, you can then apply the appropriate marking to
	all accesses to that variable, even if they may not actually race
	with another access.</li> 

	<li><b>For any access to any shared variable for which there is a
	possibility of a data race, except for certain cases where a
	reasonable compiler (as opposed to a theoretical demonic compiler
	that just barely adheres to the standard) would not break
	concurrent algorithms</b>: Act on most KCSAN reports, but also
	configure KCSAN to match your notion of what constitutes a
	reasonable compiler (but note that the defaults are quite forgiving
	of data races). If some future compiler becomes unreasonable and
	thus applies optimizations that break concurrent code, the Linux
	community would disable those optimizations by specifying compiler
	flags. However, it is worthwhile to look at other accesses to the
	variables in KCSAN reports because, similar to lockdep, KCSAN
	reports only those data races exercised by actual executions.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
	Patch submissions based on KCSAN reports also need a strategy:
	As noted in part&nbsp;1, you should not respond to KCSAN reports by
	mindlessly adding <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, <tt>data_race()</tt>, and <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>.
	Instead, a patch addressing a KCSAN report must clearly identify
	the fix's approach and why that approach is appropriate.

<p>
Of course, the KCSAN report should be included in the commit log,
preferably with file/line numbers; simplify the report,
where appropriate, by removing irrelevant portions of the
stack traces, for example.  Furthermore, the commit log should include a detailed description
of the problem that the KCSAN report identified and the reasoning behind
the fix.  Where possible, this reasoning can reference or excerpt
the comments and documentation defining the design rules violated by
the old code. In a few cases, this detailed description might obviate
the KCSAN report, but in that case, please do at least credit KCSAN.

<p>
If the commit's effect is to merely silence the warning with no other
algorithmic change, many maintainers will treat the commit with great
suspicion—and rightly so. Therefore, such commits should include a clear
explanation 
why silencing the warning is the right thing to do.

<p>
Finally, the commit log should include instructions to reproduce the
data race, if possible, along with any non-default <tt>Kconfig</tt> options.


<h4>Taking KCSAN beyond LKMM</h4>

<p>
Data races are often symptoms of logic bugs, which is why KCSAN's ability
to locate them is so valuable.  Therefore, as noted earlier, reacting to
each and every KCSAN report by mindlessly adding a <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> or
a <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> is a grave mistake, especially when the code being
modified has multiple callers.  The value of these reports is instead that
they inform the developer of unexpected concurrent accesses, and the
correct response might instead be to apply proper synchronization, for
example, by acquiring the corresponding lock.  In this case, adding the
<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> would resolve the data race, but would simply obscure
the underlying bug without actually helping anything at all.  So again
please think carefully about KCSAN's reports instead of mindlessly reacting
to them.

<p>
This is why the previous section recommends leaving accesses unmarked
in many cases: leaving them unmarked means that a race-condition bug will
result in a data race, permitting KCSAN to find it for you. 

<p>
Although KCSAN's ability to identify data races is extremely useful,
data-race detection is just the tip of its iceberg.  For example, suppose
that 
there is a bug in which a pointer is leaked from an RCU read-side critical
section, perhaps as follows: 

<pre>
	// Reader:
	p = NULL;
	rcu_read_lock();
	list_for_each_entry_rcu(p, list1_head, list1) {
		if (p-&gt;key = mykey)
			break;
	}
	if (p)
		do_something_with(p);
	rcu_read_unlock(); // At this point, *p is no longer protected.
	do_something();
	if (p)
		do_something_else_with(p); //BUG:  Leaked pointer!
</pre>

<p>
Suppose further that the updater splices <tt>list1_head</tt> onto
<tt>list2_head</tt> using <tt>list_splice_init_rcu()</tt> as follows: 

<pre>
	// Updater:
	list_del_rcu(&amp;fp-&gt;list1);
	list_splice_init_rcu(list1_head, list2_head, synchronize_rcu);
</pre>

<div class="tlr">
<a name="qq3"></a>
<b>Quick quiz 3</b>:
But isn't it rather unlikely that <tt>do_something()</tt> will consume
enough time for the grace period to complete?
<br><a href="#qq3answer">Answer</a>
</div>

<p>
By the time that <tt>list_splice_init_rcu()</tt> returns, RCU readers might
be legitimately traversing all of the elements on <tt>list2_head</tt>,
including those recently on <tt>list1_head</tt>, thus preventing KCSAN from
providing any useful information.  However, there is a point within
<tt>list_splice_init_rcu()</tt> where non-leaky RCU readers will not have
access to the elements from <tt>list1_head</tt>. At this point, calls to
<tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS()</tt>, as shown below, will allow KCSAN to
detect leaky RCU readers: 

<pre>
	static inline void __list_splice_init_rcu(struct list_head *list,
						  struct list_head *prev,
						  struct list_head *next,
						  void (*sync)(void))
	{
		struct list_head *first = list-&gt;next;
		struct list_head *last = list-&gt;prev;

		INIT_LIST_HEAD_RCU(list);
		sync();
		ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS(*first); // KCSAN, any off-CPU accesses?
		ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS(*last);
		last-&gt;next = next;
		rcu_assign_pointer(list_next_rcu(prev), first);
		first-&gt;prev = prev;
		next-&gt;prev = last;
	}

	static inline void list_splice_init_rcu(struct list_head *list,
						struct list_head *head,
						void (*sync)(void))
	{
		if (!list_empty(list))
			__list_splice_init_rcu(list, head, head-&gt;next, sync);
	}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
KCSAN can also help when memory is freed into an emergency reserve that is
used only under out-of-memory conditions.  For example, consider this
example: 

<pre>
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&amp;p-&gt;refcount)) {
		ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS(*p);  // KCSAN, any off-CPU accesses?
		do_some_cleanup(p);
		list_add(&amp;p-&gt;freelist, &amp;emergency_reserve);
	}
</pre>

<div class="tlr">
<a name="qq4"></a>
<b>Quick quiz 4</b>:
Why not also apply KCSAN in the more common case where the list elements
are instead freed via <tt>kfree()</tt>? After all, KCSAN should be able to
directly detect the resulting use-after-free bug, shouldn't it? 
<br><a href="#qq4answer">Answer</a>
</div>

<p>
The call to <tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS()</tt> allows KCSAN to detect buggy
concurrent accesses that failed to acquire the needed reference. 
</p>

<p>
There is another set of patterns, where
concurrent reads are allowed, but concurrent writes are forbidden; bugs in
the implementation of these patterns man not be data races. Consider
the case where we 
are only supposed to have a 
single writer, but multiple concurrent readers; to avoid data races, all
these accesses must be marked. Concurrent <i>marked</i> writes,
however, that are
racing with the single writer are bugs. Unfortunately, due to being marked,
they are no longer data races. Could KCSAN help us in this case? 

<p>
For example, a common pattern involves a variable that is updated only when
its lock is held, but that can be read locklessly.  Given that there
are lockless marked reads scattered hither and yon, it is all too easy to
add a buggy lockless <i>marked</i> write, and such writes can be quite
difficult to find, especially in cases involving locks held across deeply
nested function calls.  Of course, the <tt>lockdep_is_held()</tt> function
can be extremely useful in these situations, but in the all-too-common case
where the variable in question is a non-uniquely named field in a
structure, it can be surprisingly hard to place calls to this function
everywhere it is needed and nowhere that it is not. 

<p>
Again, KCSAN can help:

<pre>

<b>Quick quiz 5</b>:
So KCSAN can unconditionally locate bugs stemming from unauthorized
lockless writes?
<br><a href="#qq5answer">Answer</a>
</div>

<p>
Of course, <tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER()</tt> can also be used to detect
off-CPU writes to per-CPU variables that are supposed to be read-only to
other CPUs, as well as similar bugs that do not directly result in data
races. 

<p>
We are confident that continued experience with KCSAN will result in
additional tricks for finding other types of concurrency bugs. 

<p>
In addition, we expect that KCSAN will continue to gain more
capabilities. One late-breaking example is a bit-granular variant of
<tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER()</tt> called
<tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_BITS()</tt>. This supports bitmask use cases where
some bits are read-only or are supposed to be modified only under the
protection of an exclusive lock, while others can be modified concurrently.
Note again that a knee-jerk application of <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> to silence
KCSAN would be obscuring a real bug, which is most definitely not what we
want. 


<h4>Alternative approaches</h4>

<p>
An alternative data race detection approach for the kernel can be found in
the <a href="https://github.com/google/ktsan/wiki">Kernel Thread Sanitizer
(KTSAN)</a>. KTSAN is a data-race detector that explicitly establishes
which memory operations are ordered (this is also known as a
"<a
href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf">happens-before
[PDF]</a>" <a
href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35604.pdf">data-race
detector [PDF]</a>). This information can
then be used to determine data races as <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt#n1922">defined
by the LKMM</a>.

<p>
To build a correct happens-before relation, KTSAN must be
aware of all ordering rules of the LKMM and the synchronization
primitives. Unfortunately, any omission leads to large numbers of false
positives; this is especially detrimental in the context of the kernel,
which includes numerous custom synchronization mechanisms. To track the
happens-before relation, KTSAN's implementation requires metadata for each
memory location (shadow memory), which corresponds to four extra pages
of shadow memory for each page of kernel memory; that can translate into
overhead of tens of GiB on a large 
system. In contrast, KCSAN's memory overhead is only a few MiB depending on
configuration. Relying on the happens-before relation, however, allows
KTSAN to detect more subtle bugs, such as missing memory barriers (implicit
or otherwise). KCSAN is currently oblivious to any memory-ordering
guarantees and simply assumes that memory barriers are placed correctly
(and developers should therefore carefully consider the required
memory-ordering requirements that remain unchecked).  

<p>
Another approach relies on <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/locking/lockdep-design.txt">lockdep</a>,
which can sometimes point to data races due to failure to acquire the
necessary locks.  This, however, requires explicit lockdep
annotations. KCSAN can detect the resulting data races without any added 
annotation, but on the other hand, for KCSAN to diagnose the problem, both
ends of the data race must execute at about the same time.  Therefore,
lockdep can detect more bugs with less test time if the required
annotations are in place, but KCSAN can detect those bugs without the
annotations, albeit requiring more test time.  These approaches should thus
be used in concert, with lockdep annotations being added to code that KCSAN
has shown is prone to being invoked without holding the required locks.

Is there a place for a user-space CSAN?
<br><a href="#qq6answer">Answer</a>
</div>

<p>
All of these tools use dynamic techniques, which means that none of them
will diagnose problems on code paths that are not reached by the test
cases. On the other hand, experience to date indicates that dynamic
analysis approaches (especially when paired with a coverage-guided fuzzer
such as <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller">syzkaller</a>) are
more effective than static-analysis approaches at locating these classes of
bugs in large code bases. For example, the LKMM tooling can more
deterministically detect data races and other concurrency issues, but is
limited to only a few tens of lines of code, six orders of magnitude short
of what is required for the Linux kernel. Nevertheless, the LKMM is
extremely useful at design time and for educational purposes. 
</p>

<h4>Summary and known limitations</h4>

<p>
Clearly, bugs involving data races should fear a data-race detector, but
KCSAN's <tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER()</tt> and
<tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS()</tt> macros provide artificial data races
that can aid in the detection of other forms of race conditions.  KCSAN-detectable
concurrency bugs discussed earlier in this article include: 

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li>Failing to acquire needed locks.</li>
	<li>Off-CPU accesses to CPU-private per-CPU variables.</li>
	<li>Use-after-free bugs for non-heap memory.</li>
	<li>Leaking pointers from RCU read-side critical sections.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These types of bugs can be quite challenging to find by testing or by
manual code review. Therefore, KCSAN's automated code review should prove
to be helpful. 

<p>
Of course, KCSAN does have limitations:

<ul class="spacylist">
	<li>As a runtime tool, KCSAN detects races only between accesses
	that execute on different CPUs at about the same time.  (But note
	that a recent KCSAN patch allows checking for data races between
	accesses at process level and in interrupt handlers within the same
	CPU.)</li> 

	<li>Although KCSAN provides a number of configuration options, it
	is currently unable to analyze the compiled code's use of a loaded
	value.  We expect KCSAN to become more capable over time, but
	features requiring changes to compilers will take some time to
	reach KCSAN's users.</li> 

	<li>Manual analysis is sometimes required to work out which
	subsystem caused a given KCSAN report.  This is, of course, a
	limitation shared by all tools that display stack traces.</li> 

	<li>KCSAN does not understand much about your synchronization
	design, so deep knowledge of the code is required to respond
	meaningfully to KCSAN reports.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
Despite these limitations, KCSAN has proven to be useful,
locating a number of subtle and hard-to-spot concurrency bugs in the short
time it has been available.  We expect that its tireless and thorough
automated reviews of concurrent code will be a valuable addition to the
Linux kernel's storied 10,000 code-review eyes.

<b>Quick quiz 3</b>:
But isn't it rather unlikely that <tt>do_something()</tt> will consume
enough time for the grace period to complete?
<p>
	<b>Answer:</b> True enough. After all, KCSAN cannot help unless
	the data-racy accesses happen at about the same time.  However,
	there are ways to help KCSAN help you: 
	<ul class="spacylist">
		<li>Test on a <tt>CONFIG_PREEMPT=y</tt> kernel, so that the
		end of an un-nested <tt>rcu_read_unlock()</tt> implies a
		quiescent state.</li> 

		<li>Add test code to <tt>rcu_read_unlock()</tt> that
		infrequently adds random delays when not within another RCU
		read-side critical section.</li> 

		<li>For testing, pass <tt>synchronize_rcu_expedited()</tt>
	to <tt>list_splice_init_rcu()</tt> instead of 
	<tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt>.</li>

<b>Quick quiz 4</b>:
Why not also apply KCSAN in the more common case where the list elements
are instead freed via <tt>kfree()</tt>? After all, KCSAN should be able to
directly detect the resulting use-after-free bug, shouldn't it? 
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Yes, it might, but <a
	href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html">KASAN</a>
	is normally a better choice than KCSAN for use-after-free bugs.
	However, finding racy use-after-free bugs with KASAN can be quite
	challenging, in part because KASAN has no way to know that the bug
	was in fact due to a race condition rather than a deterministic
	use-after-free situation.  In addition, KASAN cannot help when the
	memory is not free, but instead placed into a private pool as in
	the earlier example. However, KCSAN can still help if you invoke
	<tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS()</tt> just after removing others'
	access to the memory. 

	<p>
	In short, we recommend starting with KASAN when tracking
	use-after-free bugs, but looking to KCSAN in those rare cases where
	KASAN is flummoxed due to race conditions or private memory pools.

<b>Quick quiz 5</b>:
So KCSAN can unconditionally locate bugs stemming from unauthorized
lockless writes?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> We are sorry, but, although we believe that KCSAN
	will prove to be an extremely valuable tool, it is not magic. 

	<p>
	KCSAN is a runtime tool, which means that it will not detect bugs
	in code paths that are not actually executed.  Furthermore, the
	unauthorized-write bug must execute reasonably close to the time
	that the <tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER()</tt> is executed, and that
	write must occur on some other CPU.  Additionally, KCSAN does
	impose significant overhead, and that overhead might well turn your
	bug into a heisenbug. 

	<p>
	Again, KCSAN is not magic.  If it is magic that you are looking
	for, we refer you to any number of works of fiction, with "Harry
	Potter", "A Wizard of Earthsea", and the television series "Grimm"
	coming immediately to mind.  And sometimes escaping into fiction
	for awhile is a good way to free your mind (oops, no, that is "The
	Matrix") to locate the bug.  But in our experience, a good night's
	sleep usually works even better.

<b>Quick quiz 6</b>:
Is there a place for a user-space CSAN?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> User space has different constraints than the
	kernel. For user-space C and C++ programs, we can generally rely on
	a limited set of synchronization primitives (pthreads) and
	adherence to the standard memory models (C11, C++11). As such, <a
	href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual">ThreadSanitizer
	(TSAN)</a> is a more complete solution in user space that is already
	 well-established. A user-space variant of CSAN would therefore
	not add much value over TSAN. Note that, while KCSAN as implemented
	in the Linux kernel provides additional facilities to express
	properties where bugs won't manifest as data races
	(<tt>ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE</tt> macros), fundamentally TSAN could
	provide similar facilities for user space. In other contexts, where
	TSAN is not yet implemented, and constraints are closer to the
	Linux kernel, such as firmware, or specialized OSes, CSAN would be
	an attractive alternative.

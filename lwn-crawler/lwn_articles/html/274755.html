           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 24, 2008</br>

<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/245671/">Kernel markers</a> are a
mechanism which allows developers to put static tracepoints into the
kernel.  Once placed, these markers can be used by operations staff to
trace well-known events in running systems without that staff having to
know about kernel code.  Solaris provides a long list of static tracepoints
for use with Dtrace, but Linux, thus far, has none.  That situation should
eventually change - static markers were only merged into the mainline in
2.6.24.  But, as the developers start to look more seriously at markers,
some interesting issues are coming up.
<p>
One of those emerged as a result of <a href="/Articles/274756/">this
patch</a> from Mathieu Desnoyers which allows proprietary modules to
contain markers.  The fact that current kernels do not recognize markers in binary-only
modules is mostly an accident: markers are disabled in modules with any sort
of taint flag set as a way to prevent kernel crashes - a kernel oops being
a rather heavier-weight marker than most people wish to encounter.
Matthieu tightened that test in a way that allows markers in proprietary
modules, saying "<q>let's see how people react</q>".  Needless to
say, he saw.
<p>

One might well wonder why the kernel developers, not known for their
sympathy toward proprietary modules in general, would want to consider
letting those modules include static tracepoints.  The core argument here
is that static markers allow proprietary modules to export a bit more
internal information to the kernel, and to their users.  It is seen as a
sort of (very) small opening up on the part of the proprietary module
writer.  Mathieu <a href="/Articles/274762/">says</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I think it's only useful for the end user to let proprietary
	modules open up a bit, considering that proprietary module writers
	can use the markers as they want in-house, but would have to leave
	them disabled on shipped kernels.
</div>
<p>

The idea is that, by placing these tracepoints, module authors can help
others learn more about what's going on inside the module and help people
track down problems.  The result should be a more stable kernel which -
whether proprietary modules have been loaded or not - is generally
considered to be a good thing.
<p>

On the other hand, there's no shortage of developers who are opposed to
extending any sort of helping hand to binary module authors.  Giving those
modules more access to Linux kernel internals, it is argued, only leads to
trouble.  Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/274760/">put it this way</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Why are we even arguing about this? Binary modules should be as
	isolated as possible - it's a totally untrusted entity and history
	has shown it again and again that the less infrastructure coupling
	we have to them, the better.
</div>
<p>
Ingo also worries that allowing binary modules to use markers will serve to
make the marker API that much harder to change in the future.  Since that
API is quite young, chances are good that changes will happen.  As much as
the kernel developers profess not to care about binary-only modules, the
fact of the matter is that there are good reasons to avoid breaking those
modules.  The testing community certainly gets smaller when testers cannot
load the modules they need to make their systems work in the manner to
which they have become accustomed.  So it is possible that allowing
proprietary modules to use markers could make the marker API harder to fix
in future kernel releases.
<p>
The grumbles have been loud enough that Matthieu's patch will probably not
be merged for 2.6.25.  The idea is likely to come back again, but
not necessarily right away: the marker feature may have been merged in
2.6.24, but it would appear that 2.6.25 will be released with no actual
markers defined in the source.  It's not clear that binary-only module
authors are pushing to add tracepoints when none of the other developers
are doing so.  Until somebody starts actually using static markers, debates
on <i>where</i> they can be used will continue to be of an academic nature.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

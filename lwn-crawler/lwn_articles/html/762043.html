           </div>
Once upon a time, the only way to control how the kernel's CPU scheduler
treated any 
given process was to adjust that process's priority.  Priorities are no
longer enough to fully control CPU scheduling, though, especially when
power-management concerns are taken into account.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180806163946.28380-1-patrick.bellasi@arm.com/">utilization
clamping patch set</a> from Patrick Bellasi is the latest in a series of
attempts to allow user space to tell the scheduler more about any specific
process's needs.
<p>
Contemporary CPU schedulers have a number of decisions to make at any given
time.  They must, of course, pick the process that will be allowed to
execute in each CPU on the system, distributing processes across those CPUs
to keep the system as a whole in an optimal state of busyness.
Increasingly, the scheduler is also involved in power management — ensuring
that the CPUs do not burn more energy than they have to.  Filling that role
requires placing each process on a CPU that is appropriate for that
process's needs; modern systems often have more than one type of CPU
available.  The scheduler must also pick an appropriate operating power
point — frequency and voltage — for each CPU to enable it to run the
workload in a timely manner while minimizing energy consumption.
<p>
One of the scheduler's key tools is <a href="/Articles/741171/">load
tracking</a>: observing how much CPU 
time each process actually uses over time and using the result to estimate
what its future needs will be.  As used in this patch set, loads are
expressed in terms of percentages; 0% for a process that is not running at
all to 100% for a process that will use the full power of the fastest CPU
in the system running at its highest frequency. 

Using load tracking, the scheduler can
distribute processes in a way that avoids overloading any specific
processor, put the more resource-intensive processes on the faster
processors, and pick an operating power point that is fast enough to handle
the total load on each CPU.  But, while load tracking tells the scheduler
how much CPU any given process is likely to need, it says less about
<i>how</i> the process needs to use that time.
<p>
A realtime process, for example, probably does not need large amounts of
CPU time, but it is not able to wait to get that time.  Current schedulers
respond by running the CPU at full speed whenever a realtime process is
runnable to ensure that it doesn't miss its deadlines.  But it might also
make sense to put that process on one of the system's fastest CPUs.
Similarly, non-realtime processes may present a small load, but they may do
work that other parts of the system depend on; they should be run at high
speed even though they demand little of the processor.  On the other hand,
a background processing process might be best run at low speed on an
efficient processor, even if it could use more CPU power; it does not need
to run quickly, and it should not demand too much of the system's battery.
<p>
Different tasks can be given different priorities, but that is not a
sufficiently useful signal for the processor; priorities only say which
process should run first.  To fill this gap, Bellasi's patch set adds two
more parameters, called the minimum and maximum clamping values; they work
by constraining the scheduler's load calculations, essentially fooling the
scheduler into treating processes differently than it otherwise would.
<p>
The first of those values, the
minimum clamp, will, for any given process, place a lower bound on the
calculated 
load for the processor on which that process will run.  If process&nbsp;P,
running on CPU&nbsp;C, has a minimum clamp value of 30%, then the
calculated load for CPU&nbsp;C will never fall below 30% as long as P is
runnable, even if the actual load adds up to less than that.

The minimum clamp can thus be used to make a CPU appear to be busier than
it really is; that, in turn, will affect the frequency that the scheduler
chooses for that processor.  An important control process might only require
2% of a CPU's capacity; if it's running alone, it will likely be run at a low
speed.  If its minimum clamp is set to 80%, though, the scheduler will
pick a higher frequency and that process will get its time more quickly.
<p>
Similarly, the maximum clamp places an upper bound on how busy the
processor will look.  A background process may present a 99% CPU load, but
setting the maximum clamp to a number like 20% will prevent that process
from forcing the CPU frequency to a higher value.  For both values, the
effective value used by the scheduler is the maximum of all of the runnable
process's values.  If one process needs a minimum clamp of 50%, for
example, the
scheduler will not use a value lower than that.  The default values are 0%
and 100% for the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
<p>
There are a few ways to set these values.  The clamp parameters for a
specific process can be changed with the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setattr.2.html"><tt>sched_setattr()</tt></a>
system call; there do not appear to be any special privileges required if
a process is changing its own values.
Both ordinary and realtime processes can set their clamping values;
processes running under the deadline scheduler already provide enough
information for the scheduler to make the necessary decisions.

Control
groups can be used to set these values for all processes running within a
group, via the new <tt>util.min</tt> 
and <tt>util.max</tt> knobs added to the CPU controller.  Finally, default
clamp values for processes running in the root group are controlled by the
<tt>sched_uclamp_util_min</tt> and <tt>sched_uclamp_util_max</tt> sysctl
knobs.
<p>
In this patch set, the clamp values only affect the operating power point
chosen for any given CPU by the scheduler.  Future plans include using
these values for CPU selection; a process with a low maximum clamp might be
relegated to a slow (efficient) processor even if it could consume more CPU
time, for example.
<p>
The average desktop or server user is unlikely to make much use of this
capability; it's probably not worth the trouble to figure out what the
clamp values should be.  But, in dedicated systems where it is relatively easy
to figure out which processes are important — handsets, for example — a
user-space daemon can automatically tune the system for better overall
performance.  So it is not surprising that this work has come out of the
Android world, or that it is already in use in Android systems to
ensure that processes important to the user run quickly, while keeping
low-level background work from overheating the device or draining the
battery.  The Android developers have been looking for a way to get this
sort of functionality upstream for some time; perhaps this patch set will
be the one that succeeds and brings the Android kernel that much closer to
the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm pretty sure this has already been considered but if processes don't need special privileges decide their minimum clamp value - which affect how frequently it gets chosen - wouldn't this lead to mischievous processes abusing this feature to prioritize themselves?<br>

I'm not the developer of these patches, but I am familiar with them so I thought I might try to expand a little for readers here who don't use LKML. Utilization clamping doesn't relate to priority or interact with pick_next_task and friends, it is more about the apparent execution time which is tracked (in a frequency and cpu-type invariant manner so that signals can be compared across CPUs in a system) by the scheduler and visible (aggregated at cpu level) to the cpu frequency governors. You cannot change your priority with this API.<br>
<p>
This API only allows a task to impose restrictions on itself (i.e. use a lower value for min or max utilization) from the default values, which can be controlled hierarchically using the cpu cgroup controller. Regardless of the presence of this feature or any imposed restrictions on apparent utilization or not, a task may already execute for as long as it has work to do in accordance with it's granted cpu bandwith, priority and scheduling policy. I think the only risk from a malicious application here is running a busy loop to drain a battery or otherwise disrupt system resources - you already have to use the other tools at your disposal to guard against that if you want to, and this feature doesn't change any of those.<br>
<p>
The cover letter talks about in future using the restrictions to impact task placement along with frequency guidance but this version only shows frequency guidance as the other mechanisms required to implement the task placement guidance aren't present yet. We've been using SchedTune ( <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/706374/">https://lwn.net/Articles/706374/</a> ) in Android for equivalent functionality for a few years now but it wasn't really suitable for all Linux kernel users hence the util-clamp patches. In SchedTune we already use the modified utilization signals to limit the potential pool of CPUs in big.LITTLE systems (i.e. you can configure a task to never look large enough to run on a big CPU or never look small enough to run on a little CPU) but you can't do that without the scheduler making use of task utilization when selecting candidate CPUs for placement which isn't present upstream yet. The Energy Aware Scheduling patches - which Jonathan wrote about at <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/749900/">https://lwn.net/Articles/749900/</a>  - add utilization &amp; capacity aware wakeup placement to CFS and v5 can be seen at <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180724122521.22109-1-quentin.perret@arm.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180724122521.22109-1-quent...</a> if anyone wants to test/review it. Once such mechanisms are available to the scheduler, they can be extended to use the utilization-clamped values to influence task placement as well.<br>
<p>
Another part of the solution for improving task placement in a big.LITTLE system that we use in Android is made from a feature called 'Misfit Task Detection', which you can also find on LKML at <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1530699470-29808-1-git-send-email-morten.rasmussen@arm.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1530699470-29808-1-git-send-...</a><br>
<p>
These pieces are individually useful but also fit together to provide all the mechanisms required for fine-grained control of CPU placement and frequency selection to an intelligent userspace for battery powered devices and potentially other types of hardware.<br>

The secure computing ("seccomp") mechanism helps in the sandboxing of
processes by restricting access to system calls.  Seccomp works by
attaching one or more programs to a process; 
those programs, written in Berkeley packet filter (BPF) byte code, are
invoked for every system call made by the affected process.  The BPF filter
programs have access to the system call number and arguments; each filter
has the option of denying the system call.  Seccomp filters can thus
restrict access to specific system calls, or, for example, only allow
<tt>write()</tt> to be called on specific file descriptors.  This mechanism
works well as far as it goes, but it was not designed for use with
multi-threaded programs.  A set of proposed changes should close that
particular functionality gap in the near future, though.
<p>
In current kernels, a process can apply a filter program to itself with the
<tt>prctl()</tt> system call:
<p>
<pre>
    prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, filter);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>filter</tt> is a pointer to a <tt>sock_fprog</tt> structure
containing the BPF program to be applied.  Multiple programs can be added
with multiple <tt>prctl()</tt> calls; each will be executed in sequence and
any can reject a system call.  There is no mechanism for removing filters
once they have been applied to a process.  Adding filters is normally a
privileged operation; otherwise there is a real risk of privilege
escalation via setuid programs that do not expect some operations to be
denied (see <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/Home/thesendmailcapabilitiesissue">this
old sendmail vulnerability</a> for an example).  But any process may set
filters on itself if it has first called: 
<p>
<pre>
    prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1);
</pre>
<p>
to disable the addition of any privileges to the process.  In particular, a
process marked as "no new privileges" cannot gain capabilities or access to
a different user ID by running setuid or setgid programs.

<p>
What is lacking in the current interface is any way for a process to apply
filters to a different process (or thread).  There does not seem to be a
use case for the ability to add filters to arbitrary processes; among other
things, trying to contain a program that is already off and running would
be a recipe for unpleasant race conditions.  But it
seems that there is value in allowing a thread to apply filters to its
sibling threads.  In the absence of this ability, it can be hard to ensure
that a seccomp filter applies to <i>all</i> threads running as part of a
process.  Threads inherit their parent's filters when they are created, but
any threads created before the filters are applied will remain
uncontained.  It may not always be practical to set up the filters before
any threads are created, so the ability to attach them to threads after
creation is a useful way to ensure that no part of a program escapes
filtering.
<p>
Adding that ability is the object of <a href="/Articles/600103/">this patch
set</a> from Kees Cook.  All Kees really needed to do was to add an "apply
this filter to all threads" flag to the <tt>PR_SET_SECCOMP</tt> operation,
but, <a href="/Articles/585415/">as so often seems to be the case</a>, that
operation was defined without 
the ability to pass in additional flags to modify its behavior.  So,
instead, Kees has added a new operation:
<p>
<pre>
    prctl(PR_SECCOMP_EXT, SECCOMP_EXT_ACT, SECCOMP_EXT_ACT_FILTER, flags, filter);
</pre>
<p>
If <tt>flags</tt> is zero, this operation behaves just like the
<tt>PR_SET_SECCOMP</tt> example
above; it attaches <tt>filter</tt> to the calling process.  But if the
<tt>SECCOMP_FILTER_TSYNC</tt> flag is set, the given <tt>filter</tt> (along
with any other filters already applied to the calling process) will be
applied to all threads in the process's thread group, thus ensuring that
all threads are running with the same set of filters.
<p>
There is one other new operation:
<p>
<pre>
    prctl(PR_SECCOMP_EXT, SECCOMP_EXT_ACT, SECCOMP_EXT_ACT_TSYNC, 0, 0);
</pre>
<p>
This one will apply the calling process's filters to all other threads
without making any changes to the filters themselves.
<p>
In either case, other threads will only have their filtering changed if
whatever filter they currently have applied is an "ancestor" of the filters
running on the calling process.  Essentially, any filters applied to the
target thread must also have been applied to the calling thread; any thread
that has a totally unrelated filter will not have its filtering changed.
If a thread is not running with a filter at all, it will be put into the
seccomp mode and the filters will be applied.  Also, if the calling thread
has the "no new privileges" mode 
set, that mode will be set on all other threads as well.
<p>
This is the fifth  version of this patch set; the previous attempts needed
work in response to locking and other issues.  Unless another problem turns
up, this code should be about ready for merging.  There does not appear to
be any opposition to the concept, so this feature could find its way into
the mainline as early as 3.16.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I knew nothing of SECCOMP filters before this article, so apologies if I am missing something.

<blockquote>But if the SECCOMP_FILTER_TSYNC flag is set, the given filter (along with any other filters already applied to the calling process) will be applied to all threads in the process's thread group, thus ensuring that all threads are running with the same set of filters.</blockquote>

Is there any way to apply the new filter to all threads without applying all previously applied filters?  Maybe that makes no sense; maybe there is no reason to apply arbitrary subsets of filters to individual threads, or maybe it is dangerous, and applying any filter should always apply all previous filters.

It's both a correctness and efficiency thing.<br>
<p>
The correctness issue is that users of sync want every other thread to end up at least as confined as the current thread.<br>
<p>
The efficiency issue is that, internally, there's a tree of filters.  Adding a filter makes a new child node.  If you can share nodes between threads, you save on memory and cache impact.<br>

Does using seccomp mean paying the cost of checking syscall calls twice?  Once by seccomp and then again by SELinux?<br>

LSMs (like SELinux) do not actually check syscalls. They do policy management at a higher level via the various "LSM hooks". The performance impact of the checks would add since they're in different areas of code with very different policy processing.<br>

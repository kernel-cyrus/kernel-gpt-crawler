<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 8, 2025</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2025/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
The kernel makes extensive use of per-CPU data as a way to avoid contention
between processors and improve scalability.  Using the same technique in
user space is harder, though, since there is little control over which CPU
a process may be running on at any given time.  That hasn't stopped Mathieu
Desnoyers from trying, though; in the memory-management track of the 2025
Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit, he presented
a proposal for how user-space per-CPU memory could work.
<p>
<a href="/Articles/1016414/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/lsfmm/MathieuDesnoyers-sm.png" alt="[Mathieu
Desnoyers]" title="Mathieu Desnoyers" class="rthumb"></a>

Desnoyers started by saying that his objective is to help user-space
developers make better use of <a href="/Articles/883104/">restartable
sequences</a>, which facilitate some types of access to per-CPU data by
interrupting a process if it is migrated during a critical section.
User-space applications generally use thread-local storage for this kind of code,
but that becomes inefficient if there are more threads running than CPUs to
run on.  Thread-local storage must also be defined statically, making it
inflexible to work with, and it can slow down thread creation if the area
is large.
<p>
So he would like to provide true per-CPU data as an alternative.  One way
<i>not</i> to do that, he said, is to structure per-CPU data in an array
indexed by the CPU number.  The implementation would be relatively simple;
code could just obtain its current CPU from <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sched_getcpu.3.html"><tt>sched_getcpu()</tt></a>
or from the restartable-sequences shared-memory area.  But if the array is
packed, the result will be cache-line bouncing between CPUs, eliminating
much (or all) of the performance benefit.  If, instead, array entries are
aligned to cache lines, there will likely be a lot of wasted space between
them.
<p>
The kernel's per-CPU allocator, he said, maps a range of address space on
each CPU to provide access to that CPU's local memory space; allocations
just return a single address that can then be used on all CPUs.  He has
implemented a similar approach in the <a
href="https://github.com/compudj/librseq">librseq</a> library.  The
allocator creates a set of memory pools, one per CPU; allocations then
return an offset that is the same on every CPU.  It is essentially the
cache-line-aligned array approach, but the allocator packs allocations
within each CPU's area, reducing the wasted memory between those areas.  It
can support multiple pools, thus isolating users from each other.
<p>
The kernel's <a href="/Articles/593918/">memfd feature</a> is used to
create the per-CPU memory pool.  It is about the only way, he said, that
allows him to create the various mappings into the same area that the
feature needs.
<p>
There are some potential problems with this approach, though.  What if a
four-thread process is running on a system with 512 CPUs?  Allocating and
initializing memory for all of those CPUs would be wasteful, most of it
will never be used.  So, instead, the library initializes one CPU's worth
of memory in a special "initialization area", then creates a copy-on-write
mapping of that area for each CPU.  Any CPU reading from its area will read
from that single copy; if a CPU writes to its area, the page will be copied
and will become truly CPU-local.
<p>
<!-- middle-ad -->

Another concern relates to what happens when a process forks; the per-CPU
area will be shared across the fork, which may not be what is wanted.  He
is considering adding a memfd flag (<tt>MFD_PRIVATE</tt>) that would make a
memory area per-process; a fork would then result in the child getting a
separate copy of that area.  For now, he is using an "<q>inconvenient
workaround</q>" consisting of a couple of <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
operations to detect and handle forks.  As part of that, the library maps a
special "canary page" that is set to be cleared when a fork happens; the
contents of that page can then be checked to detect forks.
<p>
In the future, he is considering adding the ability to allocate
variable-sized elements within the per-CPU memory pool.  The placement of
guard pages between each CPU's area would prevent some cache-line bouncing
caused by one CPU prefetching into another CPU's area.  He also has
thoughts about improving the control-group CPU controller to allow for
maximum-concurrency limits, which would make it possible to put tighter
limits on the number of entries needed in the pool.
<p>
Desnoyers concluded his presentation by returning to the
<tt>MFD_PRIVATE</tt> idea, which he sees as the best way of solving the
fork problem.  This feature would be useful in other contexts, he said.
The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3314221.3314582">MESH
allocator</a> needs this kind of feature, as do Google's dynamic-analysis
tools.  David Hildenbrand said that <tt>MFD_PRIVATE</tt> could be a
reasonable addition, but thought that its use should also imply behavior
like that obtained with <tt>MADV_WIPEONFORK</tt>, where the memory is
zeroed when a fork happens.  Desnoyers answered that this behavior might
not be wanted; a child process could still make use of the per-CPU data
from the parent, but would have its own copy for any changes it made.
<p>
Suren Baghdasaryan commented on the possible use of guard pages to prevent
cross-CPU prefetching, noting that this behavior is architecture-dependent.
He wondered if Desnoyers has considered how this work interacts with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html">cpusets</a>.
Desnoyers said cpusets and per-CPU memory do work together, but there are
some challenges.  Since his library will not get CPU-hotplug notifications,
it has to be ready for unexpected changes in the CPU topology.
<p>
Hildenbrand asked how processes can be sure that the CPU does not change
underneath them while accessing per-CPU data; Desnoyers answered that
restartable sequences are the usual way to do that.  I followed up, asking
whether restartable sequences were the only safe way to work with this
memory; he said that there are other options, including atomic operations
or <a href="/Articles/946870/">rseq locks</a>.
<p>
The session concluded at that point.  Desnoyers has not posted the slides
from this session, but <a

Small correction: "The allocator creates a set of memory pools, one per CPU" should instead read "The allocator creates a set of memory ranges, one per CPU". The allocator does support multiple pools, and each pool consists of a set of per-cpu ranges.<br>
<p>
Also, wrt MADV_WIPEONFORK-like behavior when forking a MFD_PRIVATE memfd, the important part is that the behavior would be _similar_ to MADV_WIPEONFORK in the sense that it would make sure to remove page table entries pointing to the parent's pages from the child process page table. Then it would be up to the page fault handler to populate new pages based on the child mapping. So the idea makes sense, it's just that unlike MADV_WIPEONFORK, it would not end up populating zero pages in the child process.<br>

I'm a little confused, how can a fd flags MFD_PRIVATE affect a memory mapped range on forking?<br>
<p>
It seem to me that it'd be a MADV_ flags, such as MADV_FICLONEONFORK which will cause the file-mapped memory range to re-associate with a new backing file that is FICLONE-ed from the origin one as if ioctl(FICLONE) is called.<br>
<p>
Implementing MADV_FICLONEONFORK seams to be much simpler than the intended MFD_PRIVATE. And several filesytems have already supported ioctl(FICLONE) which can be used immediately to support for MADV_FICLONEONFORK.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, shmfs is one of the many filesystems that don’t support FICLONE. Implementing it would be quite challenging, as tmpfs/shmfs metadata is primarily stored in the page tables and struct page. I’d be glad to hear any ideas on this, as we also want FICLONE support on shmfs for templating virtual machines.<br>

Just to repeat a comment I've made a few times, restartable sequences are really two ideas conflated. One idea is that if a thread moves from one CPU to another that a signal is delivered - in this article, so that the thread can reset CPU local data structures. The second idea is a fast signal delivery mechanism where if a signal happens within a region of code it turns into a jump. If the two things were separated then the signals could be used for things like profiling, the fast delivery could be used for things like null pointer exceptions in managed languages.<br>

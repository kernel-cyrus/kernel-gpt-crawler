CPU scheduling is a difficult task in the best of times; it is not trivial
to pick the next process to run while maintaining fairness, minimizing
energy use, and using the available CPUs to their fullest potential.  The
advent of increasingly complex system architectures is not making things
easier; scheduling on asymmetric systems (such as the big.LITTLE
architecture) is a case in point.  The "turbo" mode provided by some recent
processors is another.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190625043726.21490-1-parth@linux.ibm.com/">TurboSched
patch set</a> from Parth Shah is an attempt to improve the scheduler's
ability to get the best performance from such processors.
<p>
Those of us who have been in this field for far too long will, when seeing
"turbo mode", think back to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button">the "turbo button"</a>
that appeared on personal computers in the 1980s.  Pushing it would clock
the processor beyond its original breathtaking 4.77MHz rate to something
even faster — a rate that
certain applications were unprepared for, which is why the "go slower" mode
was provided at all.  Modern turbo mode is a different thing, though, and
it's not just a matter of a missing front-panel button.  In short, it
allows a processor to be overclocked above its rated maximum frequency for
a period of time when the load on the rest of system overall allows it.
<p>
Turbo mode can thus increase the CPU cycles available to a given process, but
there is a reason why the CPU's rated maximum frequency is lower than what
turbo mode provides.  The high-speed 
mode can only be sustained as long as the CPU temperature does not get too
high and, crucially (for the scheduler), the overall power load on the
system must not be too high.  That, in turn, implies that some CPUs must be
powered down; if all CPUs are running, there will not be
enough power available for any of those CPUs to go into the turbo mode.
This mode, thus, is only usable for certain types of workloads and will not
be usable (or beneficial) for many others.
<p>
A workload that would work well in turbo mode is one where the system as a
whole is not fully utilized (so that some CPUs can be shut down), and where
a relatively small number of processes can benefit from the higher CPU
speeds.  But that benefit will only be realized if the turbo mode can
actually be used.  The CPU scheduler in current kernels balances a great
many requirements, but "make sure that some CPUs can go into turbo mode" has not
been expressed as a need to be balanced in the past.  It's thus
unsurprising that the scheduler's operation is not optimal for systems with
turbo mode and workloads that want to take advantage of that mode.
<p>
One problem in particular is that the scheduler is designed to keep the
system as responsive 
as possible and to make the fullest use of the available CPUs.  That goal
is reflected in how processes are placed on CPUs throughout the system.  If
a sleeping process wakes up and needs to execute, the scheduler will try to
place that process on an idle CPU, thus allowing it to execute immediately
rather than waiting in a run queue.  That is the right thing to do much of
the time, but it is not ideal if your objective is to keep some CPUs
powered down so that the others can run in turbo mode.  In such cases, it
might be better to put a newly awakened process onto a CPU that is already
busy and let sleeping CPUs lie.
<p>
Getting the scheduler to pack more processes into running CPUs is the
objective of the TurboSched patch set.  But such packing needs to be done
carefully; otherwise, scheduling latency could increase significantly and
system utilization could be reduced.  To avoid such problem, TurboSched
limits this packing behavior to "jitter" processes — those that run
sporadically for limited periods of time and which do not have significant
response-time requirements.   These processes are often doing some sort of
housekeeping work and do not suffer from having to share a CPU with other
work.
<p>
A question that immediately comes to mind is: how does the scheduler decide
which processes fit into this "jitter" category?  The answer is that it
doesn't; such processes need to be specifically marked by user space.
Specifically, TurboSched is built on top of the (still unmerged) <a
href="/Articles/762043/">scheduler utilization clamping</a> patch set,
which allows an administrator to impose limits on how much load any given
process appears to put on the system.  By putting an upper limit on the
apparent load, the administrator can keep a given process from forcing a
CPU's frequency to increase, even if that process will happily run 100% of
the time.  Processes marked this way already have a reduced claim to system
CPU resources; TurboSched extends this interpretation and concludes that a
sleeping CPU should not be powered up for processes whose maximum
utilization is clamped.
<p>
The logic as implemented in the patch set actually goes a little beyond
that, in that jitter processes will not be placed onto a CPU that is
running at less that 12.5% of its capacity.  The reasoning is that an
underutilized 
CPU might well go idle soon; putting a new process there could prevent that
from happening, which would be an undesirable result.  Of course, it would
also not be good to overload the running CPUs with jitter tasks, so there
is an upper limit to how much jitter load can be placed on any given CPU.
<p>
This approach may seem familiar; it is reminiscent of the <a
href="/Articles/520857/">small-task packing</a> algorithms that have been
discussed since (at least) 2012.  Small-task packing has never made its way
into the mainline, so one might wonder why this variation would be
different.  The biggest difference this time is in the explicit marking of
jitter tasks, which will effectively make TurboSched be a no-op on the bulk
of the systems out there.  In the absence of clamped tasks, the scheduler
will run as it does now, so there should be no performance regressions for
any existing workloads.
<p>
Meanwhile, the benefit for some workloads can be up to a 13% performance
increase, according to some impressive ASCII graphics in the patch
posting.  This increase won't happen with all workloads, but on dedicated
systems with well-understood and tuned workloads with the right mix of
processes, TurboSched should make things run better.  That, along with the
relatively noninvasive nature of the patch set, suggests that it might just
clear the high bar for scheduler changes.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

It feels like the system should be able to detect processes that run sporadically for limited periods of time (below, I call these 'interactive') without any sort of explicit marking. (Spotting processes with less than instant response time requirements automatically seems harder.)<br>
<p>
Every desktop and server machine I've owned for the last decade has had turbo mode, so it's lovely to see a patchset that makes the scheduler properly aware of it --- but if this patchset requires explicit marking of processes, it seems unlikely that it'll be widely used :(<br>
<p>
Speculating, perhaps the explicit marking could be automated away if there was a PAM module so you could group entire uids as interactive or not, and/or just mark everything that's a direct child of the X session as interactive -- or have the Wayland and X libraries mark clients of X or Wayland as interactive, and maybe arrange that things that talk to a TTY or PTY directly get an interactive marking... and then treat everything else with a low enough recent utilization as amenable to packing. (I'd imagine that new processes inherit the initial state of this mark from their parents, and probably you'd need a bit of code change to have make(1) and ninja etc mark themselves, since they are seriously noninteractive but only operate briefly).<br>

Once upon a time this would have been true, but I'd be surprised if systemd didn't pick this up, and Android too (to the extent it isn't doing its own thing). 
<p>
Android has a very good idea which tasks are interactive at any one point. Systemd doesn't quite have that overview of the system, but it shouldn't be difficult for a distro or admin to identify services that "run sporadically for limited periods of time and ... do not have significant response-time requirements" and mark them as such in the unit file.
<p>
I note that the most recent version "removed cgroup based task
  classification": I hope the systemd maintainers are consulted on the API.

Really?  There was  "bouncing cow problem," and this is to be named "indian run problem"<br>
<p>
<p>
3.9 Merge window part 1<br>
By Jonathan Corbet<br>
February 20, 2013 <br>
A relatively simple scheduler patch fixes the "bouncing cow problem," wherein, on a system with more processors than running processes, those processes can wander across the processors, yielding poor cache behavior. For a "worst-case" tbench benchmark run, the result is a 15x improvement in performance. <br>

All this "12.5%" and "clamped maximum utilization" thing feels a bit of a hairy heuristic to me. Wouldn't there be cases where someone would specifically want a RT process to have its maximum usage clamped to prevent it being able to lock out system administration if it went wrong?<br>

Wouldn't it be possible for this feature to piggyback on the PR_SET_TIMERSLACK setting in prctl? Surely a task which is marked as "ok being a little bit late" is exactly what this feature is looking for...<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 14, 2021</br>
           </div>
Since the release of the 5.5 kernel in January 2020, there have been almost
87,000 patches from just short of 4,600 developers merged into the mainline
repository.  Reviewing all of those patches would be a tall order for even
the most prolific of kernel developers, so decisions on patch acceptance
are delegated to a long list of subsystem maintainers, each of whom takes
partial or full responsibility for a specific portion of the kernel.  These
maintainers are documented in a file called, surprisingly, <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/MAINTAINERS"><tt>MAINTAINERS</tt></a>.
But the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file, too, must be maintained; how well does
it reflect reality?

<p>
The <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file doesn't exist just to give credit to
maintainers; developers make use of it to know where to send patches.  The
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/scripts/get_maintainer.pl"><tt>get_maintainer.pl</tt>
script</a> automates this process by looking at the 
files modified by a patch and generating a list of email addresses to send
it to.  Given that misinformation in this file can send patches astray, one
would expect it to be kept up-to-date.  Recently, your editor received a
suggestion from Jakub Kicinski that there may be insights to be gleaned
from comparing <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> entries against activity in the real
world.  A bit of Python bashing later, a new analysis script was born.
<p>
<h4>Digging into <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt></h4>
<p>
There are, it turns out, 2,280 "subsystems" listed in the
<tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file.  Each of those subsystems includes a list of
covered files and directories.  One can look at the commits applied against
those files to see who has been working in any given subsystem; writing
patches obviously qualifies as this sort of work, but so do other
activities like handling patches (as indicated by <tt>Signed-off-by</tt>
tags) or reviewing them (<tt>Reviewed-by</tt> or <tt>Acked-by</tt>).  By
making use of a bit of CPU time diverted from cryptocurrency mining, it is
possible to come up with an approximation of when a given subsystem's
listed maintainers last actually did some work in that subsystem.
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/842419/">full results of this analysis</a> are
available for those wanting to see the details.
<p>
There are, however, ways of narrowing down the data a bit to pick out some
of the more interesting artifacts in this file.  For example, there are <a
href="/Articles/842422/">367 subsystems</a> for which there is no
maintainer or the maintainer has
never been seen in the entire Git history (excluding "subsystems" with no
files â€” see below).  In many of these cases, the
subsystem itself is well past the prime of its life; there simply isn't a
lot of work for a 3c59x network-card maintainer to do these days.  The
networking developers are not buried in ATM patches, the Palm Treo hasn't
seen much support work, Apple has released few M68k systems recently, there
aren't many Arm floppy drives still in use, and
S3 Savage video cards just aren't the must-have device they once were.
Many of these entries are likely to point to code that could be removed
altogether.
<p>
Similar lessons can be drawn from <a href="/Articles/842424/">the list of
subsystems with no listed maintainers</a> at all.  Of course, some of those
are rather vague in other ways as well; one subsystem is simply called
"ABI/API" and points to the <tt>linux-api</tt> mailing list.  There is
actually one file associated with this "subsystem"; it's <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/sys_ni.c"><tt>kernel/sys_ni.c</tt></a>,
which handles calls to non-implemented system calls.  This entry is thus an
attempt to get developers to copy the <tt>linux-api</tt> list when they add
new system calls.  A similar entry exists for "Arm subarchitectures".
<p>
Some maintainerless subsystems, such as the framebuffer layer, could
probably benefit from somebody willing to take them over.  The reiserfs
filesystem lacks a maintainer but still seems to have some users.
Others, like DECnet or the Matrox framebuffer, are probably best left alone
(or removed) at this point.
<p>
Some "subsystems" listed in the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file have no files to
maintain; one interesting example is 
"embedded Linux", allegedly maintained by Paul Gortmaker, Matt Mackall, and
David Woodhouse.  Given the success of embedded Linux, one can only assume
that they are doing an outstanding job.  The "device number registry"
claims to be maintained, but the entry contains only a pointer to a
nonexistent web page.  The URLs in the "disk geometry and partition
handling" entry still work, but the pages do not appear to have been
updated for well over a decade; not much is happening with Zip drive geometry these
days, it would appear.  The man pages, instead, are actively maintained,
but they do not exist within the kernel tree.
<p>
<h4>Help needed</h4>
<p>
There are a couple of conclusions that can be drawn from the results so
far.  One is that many kernel subsystems are not really in need of
maintenance at this point; some of them, instead, may be in need of
removal.  Another is that perhaps the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file itself is
in need of a bit of cleanup in spots.  But it is also worth asking whether
this data can be used to spot subsystems that could benefit from a new
maintainer.  To answer that question, some additional CPU time was expended
to find all subsystems meeting these criteria:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> There is either no listed maintainer or the alleged maintainers have
     been inactive in that subsystem for at least six months.
<li> At least 50 commits have touched that subsystem since the release of
     the 5.5 kernel in January 2020.
</ul>
<p>
The idea behind this search was to find subsystems that are still
undergoing some sort of active development, but which do not have an
active, listed maintainer.  The results can be divided into a few different
categories.
<p>
Some <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> entries have broad lists of covered
files that make the commit count seem larger than it really is.  For
example, the subsystem named "ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFERS/TRANSFORMS (IOAT)
API" includes all of <tt>drivers/dma</tt>, which is also claimed by "DMA
GENERIC OFFLOAD ENGINE SUBSYSTEM".  That subsystem, in turn, is actively
maintained by Vinod 
Koul.   There are two subsystems that fall into this category;
in the tables below "Activity" indicates the last observed
activity by the listed maintainers (if any), while "Commits" shows the
number of commits affecting the subsystem since 5.5:

<p>
<blockquote>
<table class="OddEven">
<tr><th>Subsystem</th><th>Activity</th><th>Commits</th></tr>
<tr><td>ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFERS/TRANSFORMS (IOAT) API</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">536</td></tr>
<tr><td>HISILICON NETWORK SUBSYSTEM DRIVER</td><td>2019-11-16</td><td align="right">258</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
These subsystems either do not exist as a separate entity, or they should have their
lists of covered files reduced to match reality.
<p>
Then, there are the subsystems where the maintainers hide behind a
corporate email alias.  The listed maintainer for "DIALOG SEMICONDUCTOR
DRIVERS" is <tt>support.opensource@diasemi.com</tt>, which is obviously not
an address that will appear in any actual commits.  A look within that
subsystem shows active reviews from diasemi.com addresses, though, so the
subsystem cannot really be said to be unmaintained.  This category contains:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table class="OddEven">
<tr><th>Subsystem</th><th>Activity</th><th>Commits</th></tr>
<tr><td>DIALOG SEMICONDUCTOR DRIVERS</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">120</td></tr>
<tr><td>QUALCOMM ATHEROS ATH9K WIRELESS DRIVER</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">65</td></tr>
<tr><td>WOLFSON MICROELECTRONICS DRIVERS</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">146</td></tr>

</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
Related to the above are subsystems where the maintainer entry is simply
out of date; the listed maintainer is inactive, but somebody else, often
from the same company, has picked up the slack and is acting as a de-facto
maintainer.  These include:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table class="OddEven">
<tr><th>Subsystem</th><th>Activity</th><th>Commits</th></tr>
<tr><td>HISILICON NETWORK SUBSYSTEM 3 DRIVER (HNS3)</td><td>2019-11-16</td><td align="right">234</td></tr>
<tr><td>HISILICON SECURITY ENGINE V2 DRIVER (SEC2)</td><td>2020-06-18</td><td align="right">55</td></tr>
<tr><td>LINUX FOR POWER MACINTOSH</td><td>2018-10-19</td><td align="right">71</td></tr>
<tr><td>MELLANOX ETHERNET INNOVA DRIVERS</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">93</td></tr>
<tr><td>MELLANOX MLX4 IB driver</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">70</td></tr>
<tr><td>OMAP HWMOD DATA</td><td>2016-06-10</td><td align="right">102</td></tr>
<tr><td>QCOM AUDIO (ASoC) DRIVERS</td><td>2018-05-21</td><td align="right">125</td></tr>
<tr><td>TEGRA I2C DRIVER</td><td>2018-05-30</td><td align="right">56</td></tr>

</table>
</blockquote>
<p>

Finally, there are the subsystems that truly seem to lack a maintainer;
they typically show patterns of commits either merged by a variety of
subsystem maintainers, or passing through one of a few maintainers of last
resort.  They are:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table class="OddEven">
<tr><th>Subsystem</th><th>Activity</th><th>Commits</th></tr>
<tr><td>ARM/UNIPHIER ARCHITECTURE</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">73</td></tr>
<tr><td>DRBD DRIVER</td><td>2018-12-20</td><td align="right">51</td></tr>
<tr><td>FRAMEBUFFER LAYER</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">402</td></tr>
<tr><td>HMM - Heterogeneous Memory Management</td><td>2020-05-19</td><td align="right">54</td></tr>
<tr><td>I2C SUBSYSTEM HOST DRIVERS</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">434</td></tr>
<tr><td>MARVELL MVNETA ETHERNET DRIVER</td><td>2018-11-23</td><td align="right">65</td></tr>
<tr><td>MEDIA DRIVERS FOR RENESAS - VIN</td><td>2019-10-10</td><td align="right">56</td></tr>
<tr><td>MUSB MULTIPOINT HIGH SPEED DUAL-ROLE CONTROLLER</td><td>2020-06-24</td><td align="right">54</td></tr>
<tr><td>NFC SUBSYSTEM</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">72</td></tr>
<tr><td>PROC FILESYSTEM</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">171</td></tr>
<tr><td>PROC SYSCTL</td><td>2020-06-08</td><td align="right">51</td></tr>
<tr><td>QLOGIC QLGE 10Gb ETHERNET DRIVER</td><td>2019-10-04</td><td align="right">77</td></tr>
<tr><td>STAGING - REALTEK RTL8188EU DRIVERS</td><td>2020-07-15</td><td align="right">121</td></tr>
<tr><td>STMMAC ETHERNET DRIVER</td><td>2020-05-01</td><td align="right">174</td></tr>

<tr><td>USB NETWORKING DRIVERS</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">119</td></tr>
<tr><td>X86 PLATFORM DRIVERS - ARCH</td><td>â€”â€”</td><td align="right">120</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Most of the above will be unsurprising to people who have been paying
attention to the areas in question.  The framebuffer subsystem is a known
problem area; the "soft scrollback" capability was recently removed from
the framebuffer driver due to a lack of maintainership.  Quite a few people
depend on this code still, but it is increasingly difficult to integrate
with the kernel's graphics drivers and few people have any appetite to
delve into it.
<p>
The I2C host drivers do, in fact, have a de-facto maintainer; it's Wolfram
Sang, who also maintains the core I2C subsystem.  He has long wished for
help maintaining those drivers but none seems to be forthcoming, so he
takes care of them in the time that is available.  <tt>/proc</tt> is an
interesting example; everybody depends on it, but nobody has taken
responsibility for its maintenance.  HMM, too, is interesting; its creator
went to a lot of effort to get the code merged, but appears to have moved
on to other pursuits now.
<p>
All of the above look like places where aspiring kernel developers could
lend a welcome hand.
<p>
What about subsystems that have no entry in the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file
at all?  If one were to bash out a quick script to find all files in the
kernel tree that are not covered by at least one line in
<tt>MAINTAINERS</tt>, one would end up with <a href="/Articles/842606/">a
list of just over 2,800 files</a>.  These include the <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt>
file itself, naturally.  Of the rest, the vast majority are header files
under <tt>include/</tt>, most of which probably do have maintainers and should
be added to the appropriate entries.  Discouragingly, there are
72&nbsp;files under <tt>kernel/</tt> without a listed maintainer â€” a
situation which certainly does not reflect reality.
The SYSV IPC code is
unmaintained, reflecting its generally unloved nature.  Most of the rest of
the unmaintained files are under <tt>tools/</tt> or <tt>samples/</tt>.
<p>


  A harder case to find is that of files that are covered by a
<tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> entry, but which are not actually maintained by the
named person; this will happen often with entries that cover entire
directory trees.  Your editor is listed as handling all of
<tt>Documentation</tt>, but certainly cannot be said to be "maintaining"
many of those files, for example; this is a situation that will arise in
many places in the kernel tree.
<p>
If one were to try to draw some overall conclusions from this data, they
might read something like the following.  The <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file
definitely has some dark corners that could, themselves, use some
maintenance (some of which is <a
href="/ml/netdev/20210114014912.2519931-1-kuba@kernel.org/">already being
done</a>).  There are some parts of the kernel lacking maintainers that 
could definitely use one, and other parts that have aged beyond the point
of needing maintenance.  For the most part, though, the subsystems in the
kernel have designated maintainers, and most of them are at least trying to
take care of the code they have responsibility for.  The situation could be
a lot worse.

<p>
Out of curiosity, as this one is under media sub-system, and I know this one has been actively maintained, I did a quick check on it:<br>
<p>
The MAINTAINERS&#x27; entry for this one is:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; MEDIA DRIVERS FOR RENESAS - VIN</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; M:      Niklas SÃ¶derlund &lt;niklas.soderlund@ragnatech.se&gt;</font><br>
<p>
The last commit from its author (at linux-next) were in 2019-11-25:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; $ git log --author niklas drivers/media/platform/rcar-vin/</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Author: Niklas SÃ¶derlund &lt;niklas.soderlund+renesas@ragnatech.se&gt;</font><br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;</font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;    media: rcar-vin: Rework CSI-2 firmware parsing</font><br>
<p>
Ok, there&#x27;s no .mailmap entry for Niklas &quot;+&quot;  syntax.<br>
<p>
Yet, this is a de-facto standard supported by almost all e-mail servers, and (somewhat) defined at RFC 5233.<br>
<p>
At least on media, we&#x27;ve seen several people using either &quot;name+sponsor&quot; (we even have a major developer using &quot;name-sponsor&quot; because his e-mail server doesn&#x27;t seem to support &quot;+&quot;).<br>
<p>
I&#x27;m wondering if the results would be too different if some rule were added to cover cases like that at the script ;-)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Many of the +addresses are handled explicitly in the alias list; I doubt this is the only one to have slipped through, though... </font><br>
<p>
Makes sense for gitdm itself, as it would make sense to give different vendor credits for: name+vendor_a@bar and name+vendor_b@bar.<br>
<p>
In the specific case of just checking if a MAINTAINERS file has updated e-mails, I guess the script could simply ignore &quot;+vendor&quot; part of the e-mails, if, by doing that, there&#x27;s a match.<br>

Btw, thanks for this article! It is very nice to see some analysis about the quality of the entries at MAINTAINERS!<br>

Uh-oh... I have a different email in MAINTAINERS than the one I use for signed-off-by and acked-by (but all these different email addresses forward to the right place).  Obviously, the script did not pick that up and thus did not track my activity.<br>
<p>
I will look into either updating my entry in MAINTAINERS and/or adding an alias for the email. Sorry about that.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; But the MAINTAINERS file, too, must be maintained</font><br>
<p>
Not necessarily. It could be split into a per subsystem files. As far as I can tell, get_maintainers.pl already supports it.<br>
<p>
On such case, each subsystem-specific MAINTAINERS&#x27; file could have its own maintainer.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; In many of these cases, the subsystem itself is well past the prime of its life</font><br>
<p>
I guess one of the problems with MAINTAINERS is that subsystems and drivers are equally listed there without any split. Looking at the big picture at the full analysis data (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/842419/">https://lwn.net/Articles/842419/</a>), I noticed several drivers listed there whose last commit from the maintainer happened a long time ago - but just because they&#x27;re working properly and there was no recent need to touch them, maybe except for some kAPI changes.<br>
<p>
IMO, it would make more sense to have a main MAINTAINERS file with the subsystems that are merged directly upstream, plus a series of per-subsystem MAINTAINERS file, containing mostly driver maintainers.<br>
<p>
I suspect that this could help to keep MAINTAINERS updated.<br>

      Splitting the MAINTAINERS file was <a href="/Articles/730509/">tried in 2017</a>, but Linus didn't like it so it didn't happen.

Hello,<br>
<p>
I see that reviewers (i.e. people with an R: entry) are not considered even though there are rumors that the difference between M: and R: is only if you should add this person to To: or Cc: when creating a patch.<br>
<p>
Also it would be interesting to see not only the latest contribution but the number of contributions for each person. (Maybe with some factors involved to make older contributions count less?!)<br>
<p>
Best regards from Germany<br>
Uwe<br>

Thanks , Jon, Jackub et al ...this is as important as what Arnd is doing by take initiative to remove old architectures . <br>

Now, the problem is, I am so tempted to raise my hand to &quot;help&quot; but what stopping me , knowing fully what limitation I have and certainly don&#x27;t become a burden to a overly worked maintainers. <br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;Many of these entries are likely to point to code that could be removed altogether.</font><br>
<p>
The cost of removing support for old hardware is that anyone wishing to run that old hardware must use an old version of the kernel. The oldest longterm kernel receiving &quot;official&quot; support is 4.4.256; any hardware whose support was removed before then (or worse, a removal included in the 4.4 LTS cycle) will only work with a slew of bugs and security issues reintroduced.<br>
<p>
The benefit of removing support is, usually, maintainer comfort; such as when aes-i586 was removed during 2020q2. (the maintainers did argue, without benchmarks, that the compiler would do a better job[0].) This is understandable when a maintainer would need to track down ancient PCI network hardware and re-cap an old 68k motherboard. But in practice maintainers aren&#x27;t required to test all drivers before endorsing a common-layer change; the Linux development process assumes that when non-build breakage happens, affected parties raise a flag and a shout. It appears that maintainer comfort ultimately means someone going &quot;f##k this old s##t&quot; at something they&#x27;ve assumed responsibility for but isn&#x27;t in their employer&#x27;s micro-interest to spend two seconds of peripheral vision on; and certainly between removing and not that&#x27;s the non-constructive option.<br>
<p>
What this boils down to is that removing things usually makes Linux worse, and only very rarely better. This is a consequence of the development process laid down decades ago, which is still as good as it was then[1]. Therefore removals should be considered very, very carefully; much more so than today, where Linux appears to hover just barely above the line where J. Random Careerist can roll up, submit a feature-removal changeset, and have s/h/its name in the hallowed changelogs forever for a petty CV boost.<br>
<p>
[0] it doesn&#x27;t, and now all pre-AESNI x86 hardware spends more joules in disk encryption than before. As it turns out, programs hand-optimized for two-way superscalar are also hand-optimized for out-of-order x86. This used to be non-esoteric knowledge, if not entirely mundane.<br>
[1] if anything it&#x27;s better now, with hardware interfaces having become much more standard than they were in the early 2000s; so the amount of &quot;legacy bulk&quot; increases slower than ever before.<br>

<p>
The process does not seem to work the way you describe. I follow kernel changes here on Lwn.net and elsewhere, and when something is removed the typical changelog comment is that the removed part has been broken for N years, and *nobody complained*.<br>

The memfd interface is a bit of a strange and Linux-specific beast; it was
initially <a href="/Articles/593918/">created</a> to support the secure
passing of data between cooperating processes on a single system.  It has
since gained other roles, but it may still come as a surprise to some to
learn that memory regions created for memfds, unlike almost any other data
area, have the execute permission bit set.  That can facilitate attacks; <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221209160453.3246150-1-jeffxu@google.com/">this
patch set</a> from Jeff Xu proposes an addition to the memfd API to close
that hole.
<p>
A memfd is created with a call to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html"><tt>memfd_create()</tt></a>,
which will return a file descriptor referring to the region.  That
descriptor can be treated as an ordinary file, in that it can be written to
or read from; it can also be mapped into a process's address space.
Normally the first step will be to call <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ftruncate.2.html"><tt>ftruncate()</tt></a>
to set the size of the region; after that it can be populated with data and
passed to another process.  One interesting characteristic of memfds is
that they can be "sealed" with a call to <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html"><tt>fcntl()</tt></a>,
an operation that disallows any further changes
to the stored data.  Sealing allows a recipient to know that the contents
of a memfd will not change in unexpected ways in the middle of an
operation.
<p>
As it happens, the virtual file that underlies a memfd is created with the
execute permission bits set; that allows the memory itself to be mapped as
executable.  The result is a combination of permissions — both write and
execute permission enabled — that developers in both the kernel and user
space are increasingly going out of their way to avoid.  A memory area that
is both writable and executable gives attackers a relatively easy way to
inject their own code into a target process.  And, indeed, Xu notes in the
patch cover letter that memfd areas have been used in just that way to
attack ChromeOS systems.
<p>
One might be tempted to respond by just removing the execute permission
from the underlying memfd file unconditionally.  But at this point that
would be an ABI change, and there is at least one known (legitimate) user
of executable memfds.  The <a
href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc#readme">runc</a> container
runtime uses an executable memfd to load the image of the container it is
about to run; that feature was <a href="/Articles/781013/">added in
response to another vulnerability</a> in 2019.  So the ability to have an
executable memfd must remain.
<p>
Executable memfds do not necessarily have to be the default, though, and
processes can definitely be given the ability to make a non-executable
memfd.  Xu's patch set thus modifies the memfd API in that direction by
adding a pair of new flags for <tt>memfd_create()</tt>:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>MFD_EXEC</tt> explicitly asks <tt>memfd_create()</tt> to create
     a memfd with execute permission set.  That simply reinforces the
     current default, but the default can be changed as described below.
<li> <tt>MFD_NOEXEC_SEAL</tt>, instead, creates a memfd without execute
     permission, and applies a seal that prevents that setting from ever
     being changed.  A memfd created with this flag will thus never be
     executable no matter how hard a user-space attacker might try.
</ul>
<p>
There is a new <tt>fcntl()</tt> operation, <tt>F_SEAL_EXEC</tt>, that
seals the execute permission and prevents it from being changed thereafter.
As with all sealing operations, this change cannot be undone afterward.
<p>
The patches also add a new sysctl knob, called <tt>vm.memfd_noexec</tt>, that
is local to the current PID namespace; it controls what the kernel does
when the affected process creates a memfd without specifying either of the
two new flags.  Setting that knob to zero causes <tt>memfd_create()</tt> to
behave as if <tt>MFD_EXEC</tt> were set — the current behavior.  Setting it
to one, instead, causes <tt>MFD_NOEXEC_SEAL</tt> to be set, essentially
turning off execute permission by default.  A value of two will cause any
<tt>memfd_create()</tt> call that does not explicitly provide
<tt>MFD_NOEXEC_SEAL</tt> to fail, disabling executable memfds entirely.
The default, naturally, must be zero to 
avoid breaking any existing applications.
<p>
The new code emits a warning to the kernel log if neither of the two flags
is set when a 
memfd is created, in the hope of causing applications to be updated.  Peter Xu <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/Y5yS8wCnuYGLHMj4@x1n/">observed</a> that this could
fill the system log with a lot of warnings; after some discussion, it was
agreed to emit the warning only once per boot.  As a result, it could take
several boot cycles to discover all of the applications that need to be
fixed on a
given system, but that was deemed preferable to unlimited logging.
<p>
Finally, Paul Moore has  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHC9VhRBMTQvnBdSwMbkOsk9eemYfvCmj9TRgxtMeuex4KLCPA@mail.gmail.com/">questioned</a>
the addition of a security-module hook for <tt>memfd_create()</tt> since
there is no corresponding change to a security module to actually use that
hook.  As a result, it's possible that the hook might be taken out until
somebody wants to write a policy for this system call.  Otherwise, the
patch series appears to be ready for merging.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

IMO what we really want to do is extend the W^X philosophy into the filesystem by default; the Unix permissions can try to enforce this, though CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE ruins it (and it's a capability which is often propagated into containers).  <br>
<p>
Anyways, runc doesn't need to make a temporary copy of itself if it knows the underlying file can't be mutated.  So runc could learn to query whether the underlying binary has fs-verity enabled or comes from a read-only mount.<br>
<p>
It's kind of tempting though to try a LSM (or perhaps selinux control) which modifies CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE's semantics to not allow writing to an executable path.<br>

I guess the existence F_SEAL_EXEC implies that permissions of a memfd can be changed with fchmod. Which I never realized before, though I guess it makes sense<br>

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 15, 2023</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
In a remotely presented, memory-management-track session at the <a
href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Frank van der Linden pointed out that
the line dividing resources controlled by the kernel from those managed by
user space has moved back and forth over the years.  He is currently
interested in making it possible for user space to take more control over
the management of memory resources.  A proposal was discussed in general
terms, but it will require some real scrutiny on its way toward the
mainline, if it ever gets there.
<p>
Van der Linden noted that, in recent years, resource control has been
moving back toward user space in a number of areas.  Networking is a
prominent example of this shift.  There has also been an increasing demand
for interfaces to assist orchestrators with their work; this shows, for
example, in the proposal to add a <a
href="/ml/linux-mm/20221111084051.2121029-1-hezhongkun.hzk@bytedance.com/"><tt>pidfd_set_mempolicy()</tt></a>
system call.  He has been doing some prototyping in this area, building on
Google's extensive experience in pushing resource control to user space.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/931762/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lsfmm/FredvanderLinden-sm.png" alt="[Frank van der
Linden]" title="Frank van der Linden" class="lthumb"></a>

There are a number of existing mechanisms that can be used to influence
memory management from user space, he said.  These include a set of sysctl
knobs, control-group limits, control knobs for proactive reclaim, and the
<a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
system call.  <tt>madvise()</tt> has gained a lot of options over the
years, he said, suggesting that perhaps there is a need for a more generic
solution.  There is also the NUMA API and, for applications that
want to get deeply involved in memory management, <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>,
which actually diverts page-fault handling into user space.
His focus was on <tt>madvise()</tt> and <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html"><tt>set_mempolicy()</tt></a>,
with the idea of getting the most performance out of increasingly complex
computing environments.
<p>
The core idea behind his work is to create a structure that can be used to
provide memory-management hints and control to the kernel.  It should be
easily accessible, especially to BPF programs loaded from user space, which
would make decisions based on input received from user space via BPF maps.
He is not looking for a way to replace <tt>madvise()</tt> and
<tt>set_mempolicy()</tt>, but he would like a way to combine them in a way
that BPF programs could use.  Also needed is a way to tag a virtual memory
area (VMA) with an opaque (to the kernel) value, preferably in a way that
avoids collisions when more than one user wants to tag a given VMA.
<p>
In the prototype work done so far, he has developed a hint structure for
anonymous VMAs.  The <a href="/Articles/856931/">multi-generational LRU</a>
has been modified to use this structure to make memory accesses by some
processes count more than accesses by others.  An access by a favored
process could immediately promote a page to the youngest generation, for
example, while accesses by others could result in slower (or, indeed, no)
promotion. This mechanism would be, in essence, "a nice
value for memory access".  It was easy to implement, he said,
though he did stipulate that its practical value is "questionable".
<p>
A more useful feature, perhaps, is the ability to attach "compressibility
hints" to pages.  Google, like others, uses <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/zswap.html">zswap</a>
to compress unused pages to save memory.  Some pages do not compress well,
though, so attempts to store them in zswap are just a waste of CPU time.
An application that, for example, is storing already-compressed data in
memory can provide a hint telling the kernel not to bother trying to
compress it again.
<p>
Van der Linden closed his presentation by asking the group whether the idea
seemed like a direction worth pursuing.
<p>
The first question came from Suren Baghdasaryan, who asked why BPF had been
chosen as the way to access these hint structures.  Was that choice made
for ease of prototyping, or is a BPF-based interface the intended solution
in the end?  Van der Linden answered that BPF was the most flexible way to
begin this work, but it isn't necessarily the final result.  BPF does make
things easy, though; it performs well and, he said, having hooks for BPF is
a good thing in general.
<p>
Michal Hocko worried about exposing too many internal memory-management
details that would create future ABI problems; a mechanism like this could
be hard to maintain over the long term, he said.  This concern, in turn,
could make it hard to get the work upstream in the first place.  Van der
Linden responded that, regardless of the mechanism chosen, maintaining ABI
compatibility could be challenging; he asked if anybody could suggest a
better way to avoid such problems.  Hocko said that a well-defined user
interface might be better, but the bar for acceptance will be high
regardless.  Defining the functionality as narrowly as possible would help.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox said that this feature would have been more interesting if
it has been proposed prior to the merging of <a
href="/Articles/810076/"><tt>process_madvise()</tt></a>, which has a
similar intended functionality.  Any new approach will have to demonstrate
added value beyond what <tt>process_madvise()</tt> provides.  Van der
Linden concluded the session by saying that he would continue the
discussion by posting examples to the mailing list.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 29, 2007</br>
           </div>
The <tt>sysctl()</tt> system call allows a suitably-privileged application
to tweak various kernel parameters.  It is a useful feature which, as it
happens, is almost never used.  The reason for that is the existence of the
<tt>/proc/sys</tt> virtual directory hierarchy which exports the same
functionality in a form which is much easier to use.  Callers of
<tt>sysctl()</tt> have been encouraged to use <tt>/proc/sys</tt> instead
for a long time and the addition of new parameters to <tt>sysctl()</tt> is
considered to be against the rules.  One year ago, <tt>sysctl()</tt> was <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/204935/">removed from the 2.6.19-rc
kernels</a>, only to be restored before the final release.
<p>

<tt>sysctl()</tt> is part of the user-space ABI; it is supposed to continue
working forever.  That is why the attempt to remove it was ultimately
rolled back.  So it may be surprising to some to see <a
href="/Articles/247237/">a new removal attempt</a> by Eric Biederman.  His
latest patch adds a new deprecation warning and an entry in the feature
removal schedule putting the end of <tt>sysctl()</tt> in September, 2010.
Says Eric:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	After adding checking to register_sysctl_table and finding a whole
	new set of bugs.  Missed by countless code reviews and testers I
	have finally lost patience with the binary sysctl interface.
<p>
	The binary sysctl interface has been sort of deprecated for years
	and finding a user space program that uses the syscall is more
	difficult then finding a needle in a haystack.  Problems continue
	to crop up, with the in kernel implementation.  So since supporting
	something that no one uses is silly, deprecate sys_sysctl with a
	sufficient grace period and notice that the handful of user space
	applications that care can be fixed or replaced.
</div>
<p>
Eric's claim is that this interface is so little-used that it is visibly
rotting.  There is sufficiently little common code between the
<tt>sysctl()</tt> and <tt>/proc/sys</tt> implementations that it is easy
for the two to diverge.  In the long term, he says, the kernel community
will do a better job of not breaking applications by getting rid of
<tt>sysctl()</tt> in favor of the interface which is actually used and
maintained. 
<p>
The new patch has, predictably, drawn opposition from developers who do not
want to see the user-space ABI broken in this way.  Alan Cox has also <a
href="/Articles/247233/">suggested</a> that the deprecation warning
approach will not be successful in getting the few remaining users to
switch to <tt>/proc/sys</tt>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The whole "whine a bit" process simply doesn't work when you are
	trying to persuade people to move in a non-hobbyist context. They
	don't want to move, the message is simply an annoyance, their
	upstream huge package vendor won't change just to deal with it and
	they'll class it as a regression from previous releases, an
	incompatibility and file bugs until it goes away.
</div>
<p>
Andrew Morton, instead, <a href="/Articles/247238/">is not opposed</a> to
the patch:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I think it's worth a try.  It might take two, three or five years,
	who knows?  If it turns out to be impractical then we we can just
	change our minds later, no big loss.
</div>
<p>
While there is little disagreement with the policy that the user-space ABI
should never break, it does seem that there is room for discussion on how
that goal might best be met.  Unused code has always had a tendency to
break accidentally, and <tt>sysctl()</tt> looks to be very close to being
entirely unused.  One could, presumably, address this problem with some
sort of regression test suite - something the kernel could use more of in
general.  But the maintenance of interfaces which of almost entirely
historical interest is not really helpful to Linux users.  So, perhaps,
there needs to be a way to remove system calls which have fallen into
disuse for a long-enough period.  Should this patch go through, we shall
see whether three years is sufficient warning for such a change or not.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      What if sysctl() were replaced by a library that performed the same functions by accessing the /proc/sys filesystem?  Then the rotted code could be removed from the kernel but clients would continue to function.  As long as the intent is to provide similar capabilities from /proc/sys, the code to do the translation from one to the other could live in userspace.  After all, apps don't invoke the kernel directly, they go through glibc to do a sysctl().

      Well, glibc is one of the (very few) users, and although it does fall back to /proc/sys where needed, that's going to be both slower (more syscalls) and won't work in chroots or other environments where /proc may not be mounted.<br>
<p>
And it's generally considered bad to require a new glibc with a new kernel...<br>

      &lt;blockquote&gt;we shall see whether three years is sufficient warning for such a change or not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;<br>
Probably not. Someone putting in a new machine today will, reasonably, expect it to work for the lifetime of the hardware - say 7 years.<br>
&lt;p&gt;<br>
What ought to be done is for the kernel to log that sysctl() has been used and by what program. This will allow the identification of programs that will break when sysctl() is eventually killed.<br>

      <P>Indeed, from an<TT> strace </TT>of<TT> ls</TT>:</P>
<PRE>
    _sysctl({{CTL_KERN, KERN_VERSION}, 2, 0xbfffe41c, 31, (nil), 0}) = 0
</PRE>
<P>Seems like it'd be easy to filter out *that* specific use (getting the kernel version number), and report all the other uses.  This also argues that the kernel will probably need to support this specific sysctl even if it deprecates and ultimately removes other sysctl support. After all, we have statically linked binaries out there.</P>

      And that is what I implemented in my patch.<br>
<p>
A printk that logs when you use it and with which program and that<br>
filters out the glibc usage.<br>
<p>
Not that the glibc usage is a big deal because it is just a check for <br>
non-SMP to optimize pthreads so any value gives you correctly running <br>
code.<br>

      Current Linux still runs a lot of statically linked programs dating from <br>
1992, modulo occasional a.out-related breakage. I don't see why that <br>
should ever change (perhaps because a.out support finally gets dumped: I'm <br>
not sure how useful it is to be able to run programs which predate Windows <br>
3.1...)<br>

      People running unrecompilable proprietary software which will not be updated by the vendor are likely to be running some server distribution and stay with the kernel that shipped. IMHO, it should be removed right now.<br>

      I would disagree.  Having worked in a computer sales/support/repair role, I can say that many times I had a headache of trying to make an old application run on a new platform.  Usually there was no chance of upgrading the application because of a variety of reasons, including budgetary or regulatory reasons.  Sometimes the vendor still supported the application but didn't support it on a modern OS or hardware.<br>
<p>
For one example:  many DOS programs were bitten by a bug where they crashed when run on a Pentium III with a 100Mhz bus.  This was caused by some flaw in the time logic in some standard library (a Pascal library of some sort, IIRC).  There was actually a program floating around on the internet that could patch these programs and make them work properly, but in many cases the vendors themselves did not have a solution for the clients.<br>
<p>
Anyway, my point is that hardware failure can necessitate hardware upgrades which can necessitate OS upgrades which can lead to sysctl() not being present if you're upgrading Linux.  I don't think it's an unlikely scenario.<br>

      That is a standpoint I can accept. But then again, vendors don't have their software certified or (officially) tested for this new kernel _at all_ (example: VMware). When you call their hotline, they will just tell you that. And then you are stuck - either buy hardware that runs on the usual kernel, or do anything to get the old software to run on a new kernel, possibly modifying the application in ways that invalidate the service contracts. And this is the point I really was aiming at. When enough people get into that awkward situation and request support for newer kernels, the vendor will (if we look at this on a purely mathematical and logical basis...) revalidate their software for newer kernels (...otherwise the customers will be running away). The sooner the better.<br>
<p>
Bet what will happen. I bet that if sysctl() is going away in September 2010, then the earliest userspace software upgrade wrt. sysctl() we will see will be after {date of next non-rc release after sysctl removal}. What I believe is that even though we shout "sysctl() is going away in 3 years!", noone will be listening until it actually happened. And when it is about to go away, one side of the kernel developer group ("Janitors") will try to remove it while the other side ("Home") whines about retaining it.<br>
<p>
Just look at the RAW character device driver. There have been futile attempts at other things too.<br>

      Well, don't get me wrong, I think a certain amount of backwards compatibility can be sacrificed in the name of progress, especially if (as is believed) nobody is actually using the sysctl interface anyway.  Anyway it may be possible to write a patch for certain programs if those programs can't be modified; basically a stripped down sysctl could be made to emulate the behaviour of an unfixable app.  But I can pretty much guarantee that SOMEONE will suffer due to the loss of this function.  Some app somewhere that can't or won't be fixed will stop working and some business will lose money while a solution is investigated.  <br>

      Just keep on trimming features from sysctl and sometime in the future there will be nothing left, or at least it will have very little, and will not be a support nightmare. Later when there are very few things left put them into glibc and get rid of it totally.<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>October 16, 2024</br>
           </div>
The pidfd mechanism, which uses file descriptors to refer to processes in
an unambiguous and race-free way, <a href="/Articles/773459/">was first
introduced</a> in 2018.  Since then, the interface has <a
href="/Articles/794707/">gained a number of new features</a>, but 
development has slowed over time as the interface has matured.  There are,
however, a couple of patches in circulation that are meant to make working
with pidfds simpler in some situations.
<p>
<h4>Information from pidfds</h4>
<p>
There are a number of things that can be done with a pidfd, including
sending a signal to the process it represents or waiting for the process to
exit.  One thing that is missing, though, is the ability to acquire
information about the process.  The only way to do that in current kernels
is to turn the pidfd into a regular process ID, then use that PID to open
files under <tt>/proc</tt> and read the needed information there.  This
solution works, but it is slow, multi-step, and racy, since the process in
question might disappear in the middle of the sequence.  It also requires
that <tt>/proc</tt> be present.  It seems like there should be a better
way.
<!-- middle-ad -->
<p>
The current contender for that better way is <a
href="/ml/all/20241008121930.869054-1-luca.boccassi@gmail.com">this
patch</a> from Luca Boccassi.  It adds a new <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>
operation for pidfds called <tt>PIDFD_GET_INFO</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    size = ioctl(pidfd, PIDFD_GET_INFO, &amp;info);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>info</tt> pointer is where the returned information will be put; it
is currently defined as:
<p>
<pre>
    struct pidfd_info {
	/* Let userspace request expensive stuff explictly, and let the kernel
	 * indicate whether it knows about it. */
	__u64 request_mask;
	__u64 cgroupid;
	__u32 pid;
	__u32 tgid;
	__u32 ppid;
	__u32 ruid;
	__u32 rgid;
	__u32 euid;
	__u32 egid;
	__u32 suid;
	__u32 sgid;
	__u32 fsuid;
	__u32 fsgid;
	__u32 spare0[1];
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>request_mask</tt> field is an input parameter to the operation that
controls options for the information request; the remaining parameters are
used to return the desired information: the process ID (<tt>pid</tt>),
thread-group ID (<tt>tgid</tt>), parent-process ID (<tt>ppid</tt>), the
real user and group IDs (<tt>ruid</tt> and <tt>rgid</tt>), the effective
user and group IDs (<tt>euid</tt> and <tt>egid</tt>), saved user and group
IDs (<tt>suid</tt> and <tt>sgid</tt>), and filesystem user and group IDs
(<tt>fsuid</tt> and <tt>fsgid</tt>).  The ID of the control group
containing the process is returned in <tt>cgroupid</tt>, but only if the
<tt>PIDFD_INFO_CGROUPID</tt> bit has been set in <tt>request_mask</tt>
(because this value is a bit more expensive to obtain).
That same bit will be set in <tt>request_mask</tt> on return if
<tt>cgroupid</tt> is valid.
<p>
One can easily imagine that the list of data that one might want to obtain
will grow in the future.  As is the case with a number of recently added
kernel features, the kernel checks the size of the <tt>pidfd_info</tt>
structure passed from user space to detect older or newer versions of the
interface.  Providing new features will require adding new fields to the
structure, which will change its size, allowing a mismatch to be detected.
The kernel will not return more information than the passed-in structure
can hold, so new fields can be added in the future without breaking binary
compatibility.
<p>
While system calls typically require user space to pass the size of the
structure explicitly to the kernel so that this test can be made, the use
of <tt>ioctl()</tt> makes things just a bit easier.  As is routinely done
with <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands, the size of the
structure is encoded directly into the <tt>PIDFD_GET_INFO</tt> macro, so
it is passed implicitly to the kernel when that operation is requested.
<p>
This patch has been through nine revisions as of this writing, and seems
likely to see at least one more.  There does not appear to be any
opposition to its objective or the interface provided, though, so it can be
expected to land in the mainline before too long.
<p>
<a name="self"></a>
<h4>Self-references</h4>
<p>
Pidfds are meant to allow one process to maintain a handle on another, and
there are several system calls that allow that handle to be used to act on
another process in some way.  Sometimes, though, a process would like to
use one of those system calls to act on itself.  System calls that take a
process ID as an argument typically interpret a value of zero as referring
to the calling process, but there is no equivalent notation for the pidfd
system calls.  As a result, any process wanting to use one of those system
calls must first obtain a pidfd for itself with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_open.2.html"><tt>pidfd_open()</tt></a>.
<p>
Most of the time. this omission does not matter; for most pidfd-oriented
system calls, there is an equivalent that takes a process ID instead that
can be used.  The exception is <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_madvise.2.html"><tt>process_madvise()</tt></a>,
which has no non-pidfd equivalent — a fact that <a
href="/Articles/810076/">drove some discussion</a> while the call was being
developed.  So, if a process wants to call <tt>process_madvise()</tt> on
itself, there is no alternative to obtaining its own pidfd.


So there is no alternative to obtaining a pidfd for one's self
if the objective is to use <tt>process_madvise()</tt> on the calling
process.
<p>
Lorenzo Stoakes <a
href="/ml/all/cover.1727644404.git.lorenzo.stoakes@oracle.com">proposed</a>
to change that situation with a seemingly simple patch allowing the pidfd
argument of the relevant system calls to be specified as
<tt>PIDFD_SELF</tt>.  The call would then act on the calling process, with
no need to open and manage a separate pidfd.  The idea seems
straightforward and uncontroversial, but it turns out there is one little
catch.
<p>
Florian Weimer <a
href="/ml/all/87ttdxl9ch.fsf@oldenburg.str.redhat.com">asked</a> whether
<tt>PIDFD_SELF</tt> would refer to the current process (which means
referring to the thread-group leader within the process), or the thread
that is actually making the call.  For some system calls, that distinction
matters; the outcome will be different depending on which interpretation is
used.  Stoakes <a
href="/ml/all/42df57ac-d89c-4111-a04d-290dd2197573@lucifer.local">had
intended</a> for <tt>PIDFD_SELF</tt> to refer to the thread-group leader,
but Christian Brauner <a
href="/ml/all/20240930-verbiegen-zinspolitik-cafb730c3c84@brauner">argued
convincingly</a> that the current-thread interpretation is more likely to
be what the caller wants.  So the patch set had to change.
<p>
The <a
href="/ml/all/cover.1728578231.git.lorenzo.stoakes@oracle.com">updated
version</a> creates two new special pidfd values:
<tt>PIDFD_SELF_THREAD</tt>, which will refer to the calling thread, and
<tt>PIDFD_SELF_THREAD_GROUP</tt>, which refers to the thread-group leader.
While those names are made available to user space, there are also aliases
for those names (<tt>PIDFD_SELF</tt> and <tt>PIDFD_SELF_PROCESS</tt>,
respectively) that are what user-space programs are actually expected to
use.  In summary, the default (<tt>PIDFD_SELF</tt>) has changed to mean the
current thread, but the group-leader semantics are available as well.
<p>
With that issue resolved, there do not appear to be any remaining 
concerns about the functionality provided by this patch series.  Barring
some sort of surprise, <tt>PIDFD_SELF</tt> and <tt>PIDFD_SELF_PROCESS</tt>
seem likely to make an appearance in the 6.13 release.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I would love to see pidfd system calls to get the equivalent of /proc/pid/smaps. It takes surprisingly long to format the maps of a big process into a list of strings. A nice, clean, atomic, binary format would be a godsend.<br>

Is "atomic" actually important to you?<br>
<p>
I ask because it is more expensive and potentially infeasible.  The current interface has points of non-atomicity at PAGE_SIZE boundaries.  After we fill the page with data, we drop the mmap_sem, copy the results to userspace, then resume from the virtual address that we had got to.<br>
<p>
Given that the current interface isn't atomic, we have plans to make it cheaper by iterating VMAs under the RCU read lock, which means they can move around under us, and we will provide only limited coherency (anything which isn't modified will be shown; anything which is modified during the call may or may not be shown).<br>
<p>
This is fine for most users which are only gathering statistics which work fine if they're occasionally a little off.  And smaps is inherently racy anyway as page faults are not blocked by a read lock on the mmap_sem.<br>
<p>
But what do you need?<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt;  While system calls typically require user space to pass the size of the structure explicitly to the kernel so that this test can be made, the use of ioctl() makes things just a bit easier.

What you're looking for is a bunch of pre-processor macros defined in include/uapi/asm-generic/ioctl.h. Seeing as that header file is in uapi I think you can safely expect that their won't be breaking changes made to it.<br>

Looks like you can just right-shift the whole thing by whatever _IOC_SIZESHIFT happens to be on your particular architecture.<br>
<p>
This has to be forwards compatible or else they couldn't put it in a macro exposed to userspace. So you can just hard-code the values for each architecture that you care about and it should continue to work indefinitely.<br>

ioctl numbers have a fixed set of bits that are defined to include the structure size (see _IOC_SIZEMASK and _IOC_SIZESHIFT). This is used for all ioctls (that take struct arguments) and so cannot be changed. It's also more than large enough (_IOC_SIZEBITS == 14 bits). You can just use _IOC_SIZE from &lt;include/uapi/asm-generic/ioctl.h&gt;.<br>
<p>
While an explicit size *argument* would be nice, putting a size *field* in the structure is also brittle in other ways (userspace can forget to set it if they use designated initialisers as recommended, the kernel logic for fetching it is kind of ugly, and this design makes using the extensible struct support for seccomp I'm working on[1] harder). Ultimately, using the _IOC_SIZE bits is equivalent to passing a separate size argument except that ioctl forces you to put it in the ioctl number.<br>
<p>
Also, this design has already been used for other ioctls (like SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ADDFD).<br>

Unfortunately, no. The old /proc/$pid pidfds did work that way, but the new anonymous-inode ones don't and you need to use the new ones for almost all of the useful pidfd features. IIRC the primary issue was that making APIs which return pidfds (clone3, pidfd_open) return a file descriptor referencing a procfs dentry was not workable for a bunch of reasons and adding metadata to the inode (such as the stx_ino stuff that was recently added) would also have been quite difficult.<br>

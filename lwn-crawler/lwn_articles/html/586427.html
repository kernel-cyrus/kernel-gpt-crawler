<p>
Kernel developers, or at least the maintainers of the random subsystem, are
always on the lookout for sources of unpredictability 
for use in the random number pool.  In particular, there are a number of
scenarios where good random numbers are needed and the available
pool is lacking in quality—embedded systems, early in the boot process,
virtual machines, etc.—so new sources that can alleviate the problem are
generally welcome.  However, there is always the question of how much
entropy is truly provided by these sources, which is a difficult problem to
solve.  Two recent patches would contribute unpredictable sources, but
take a different approaches with regard to adding to the store of entropy.
</p>

<p>
The kernel has two separate interfaces for random number generation:
<tt>/dev/random</tt> and <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>.  They are supposed to be
used for different purposes, with <tt>/dev/random</tt> only providing as
many bits of randomness as bits of entropy have been added to the
pool—blocking if insufficient entropy is available.  It is meant to be used
for long-lived keys (e.g. the SSH key for the system), while
<tt>/dev/urandom</tt> provides cryptographic-strength pseudo-random numbers
without the entropy requirement (and, thus, no blocking).  Data read from
either device comes from the same pool, but the entropy requirement is
only applied for reads from <tt>/dev/random</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Unpredictable events measured by the kernel (that cannot be observed by an
adversary) make up the input to the
entropy pool from which the random numbers are generated.  Various kinds of
interrupts are used (e.g. intra-key timing from the keyboard, sometimes
disk or network device intra-interrupt timing, and so on) and their values
are mixed 
into the pool.  As that is done, an estimate of how many bits of
entropy are being contributed is added to the entropy count.  That estimate
is hopefully conservative enough that it underestimates the amount of true
entropy in the pool, while trying not to make it impossible to generate a
reasonable number of random bits in a reasonable time.
</p>

<p>
An even more conservative approach would be to add unpredictable data to
the pool without crediting any entropy.  That is already done with some
sources in today's kernel, such as when adding unpredictable device-specific
data using <tt>add_device_randomness()</tt>. There is value in adding "zero
credit" (i.e. no entropy contributed) 
unpredictability to the
pool.  Any data that is added perturbs the state of the pool, which will
change the values produced by <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>.  In some situations,
the same random numbers would be produced boot after boot if there were no
unpredictable data added.

<h4>CPU randomness</h4>

<p>
"Zero credit" is the approach Jörn Engel took with
his <a href="/Articles/584005/">CPU randomness patch</a>.  It mixes
uninitialized stack values with unpredictable values like <tt>jiffies</tt>
into its own pool, then mixes that pool into the normal entropy pool
periodically.   It clearly adds unpredictability into the pool, but how
much entropy it provides is hard or impossible to determine, so Engel gives
it no entropy credit.
</p>

<p>
The patch gathers its info from two kernel locations: the scheduler and the
slab allocator.  It uses an uninitialized four-element array
(<tt>input</tt>) on the stack 
and XORs various values into it to produce the input to the private pool.  The
values used are <tt>jiffies</tt>, the value of the time stamp counter (TSC), the
address where the scheduler and allocator functions will return, a value
specific to that invocation of the scheduler or allocator, and the address
of the <tt>input</tt> array 
itself.  It is similar in some ways to the gathering that is done for
interrupts for the global pool. This collection and mixing is done quite
frequently (whenever 
<tt>need_resched()</tt> or <tt>__do_kmalloc()</tt> are called), then the
private pool is
combined with normal pool at most once per second.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, Engel's tests showed no measurable impact on kernel
performance.  For the private pool, he is using a custom mixing algorithm
that is faster than <tt>fast_mix()</tt> that is used on the global pool,
but provides worse mixing.  The normal path is used when mixing the
private pool into the global.
</p>

<p>
Engel's <a href="/Articles/587006/">focus</a> is on "<q>generating high-quality randomness as
soon as possible and with low cost to the system</q>".  In particular,
he is targeting embedded systems:
<div class="BigQuote">
But on embedded systems with less modern CPUs, few interrupt sources,
no user interface, etc. you may have trouble collecting enough
randomness or doing it soon enough.  That is the problem worth fixing.
</div>
</p>

<p>
While the values being used <i>seem</i> unpredictable, Ted Ts'o <a
href="/Articles/587013/">questioned</a> whether an "<q>attacker with deep
knowledge of how the kernel was compiled and what memory allocations
get done during the boot sequence</q>" would be able to successfully
predict some of the values.  For many kernel deployments (e.g. distribution
kernels), an attacker will be able to get that deep knowledge fairly
easily. Ts'o thought Engel's approach had promise for
improving the <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> output, but agreed with the approach of
not crediting entropy (thus not affecting how much data is available from
<tt>/dev/random</tt>).
</p>

<h4>CPU jitter</h4>

<p>
Another approach was suggested by Stephan Müller in his <a
href="/Articles/584105/">CPU Jitter random number generator (RNG) patch
set</a>. It was met with more skepticism, at least partly because it
<i>does</i> add to the entropy count.  Ts'o and others are not convinced
that sufficiently knowledgeable attackers couldn't predict the output.
Müller's reliance on statistical techniques in his <a
href="http://www.chronox.de/jent/doc/CPU-Jitter-NPTRNG.html">paper</a> to
measure the entropy pool and RNG output is also a cause 
for some skepticism.  But, <a href="/Articles/587026/">according to Müller</a>,
the statistical measures are just a "<q>necessary baseline</q>"
before he gets into "<q>measuring the actual noise coming out of the 
noise sources</q>".
</p>

<p>
Müller's method is to measure the jitter in the amount of time it takes the
CPU to perform a set of operations.  
When entropy is needed, the driver repeatedly runs two "noise sources": a
memory accessing routine that "<q>will add to the timing variations due
to an unknown amount of CPU wait states added when accessing memory</q>"
and a timestamp folding operation that is "<q>deliberately
inefficient</q>", which requires the function to be built with no
optimization (<tt>-O0</tt>). The folding operation turns a 64-bit timestamp
into one bit that is XORed into the driver's entropy pool. The jitter in
the timing 
of those two operations is also mixed
into that entropy pool one bit at a time.  Once the required entropy is
available, random numbers derived from that are returned.
</p>

<p>
While the timing is unpredictable, due to a number of the factors Müller
cites in his paper and patchset, it still amounts to a pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG), <a href="/Articles/587020/">according to H. Peter
Anvin</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
The more modern and high performance a
design you have the more sources of unpredictability there are.
However, there are very few, if any, (unintentional) sources of actual
quantum noise in a synchronous CPU, which means that this is at its core
a PRNG albeit with a large and rather obfuscated state space.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He goes on to say that independent clocks in a system would provide a
source of quantum
noise that could potentially be used to increase the entropy count, but
that such clocks are rare on today's systems as clocks are typically slaved
from the 
same source using phase-locked loops to keep them synchronized.  Thus, using
jitter (or Engel's CPU randomness) for mixing into the pool is reasonable,
Anvin 
continued, but not for entropy credit:
<div class="BigQuote">
As mentioned, I definitely have no objection to these sort of things as
zero-credit entropy sources -- they cannot, by definition, do harm,
unless they somehow cancel other inputs out -- but the notion of making
them creditable sources makes me skeptical in the extreme.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It would be nice to  assume that since there is no discernible pattern to
the output, 
there must be an underlying entropy-adding event at play.  But that is not
enough for Ts'o, Anvin, and others to be convinced.  Back in October, when
the CPU Jitter RNG was first introduced, Ts'o <a
href="/Articles/572242/">replied
at length</a> to the patch and explained the problem he saw:
<div class="BigQuote">
It may be that there is some very complex state which is hidden inside
the the CPU execution pipeline, the L1 cache, etc., etc.  But just
because *you* can't figure it out, and just because *I* can't figure
it out doesn't mean that it is ipso facto something which a really
bright NSA analyst working in Fort Meade can't figure out.  (Or heck,
a really clever Intel engineer who has full visibility into the
internal design of an Intel CPU....)
</div>
</p>

<p>
He also went on to describe ways that Müller could convince him that there
is real random noise being generated:
<div class="BigQuote">
So if you want to really convince the world that CPU jitter is random,
it's not enough to claim that it you can't see a pattern.  What you
need to do is to remove all possible sources of the uncertainty, and
show that there is still no [discernible] pattern after you do things
like (a) run in kernel space, on an otherwise [quiescent] computer, (b)
disable interrupts, so that any uncertainty can't be coming from
interrupts, etc., Try to rule it all out, and then see if you still
get uncertainty.
<p>
If you think it is from DRAM timing, first try accessing the same
memory location in kernel code with the interrupts off, over and over
again, so that the memory is pinned into L1 cache.  You should be able
to get consistent results.  If you can, then if you then try to read
from DRAM with the L1 and L2 caches disabled, and with interrupts
turned off, etc, and see if you get consistent results or inconsistent
results.  If you get consistent results in both cases, then your
hypothesis is disproven.  If you get consistent results with the
memory pinned in L1 cache, and inconsistent results when the L1 and L2
cache are disabled, then maybe the timing of DRAM reads really are
introducing entropy.  But the point is you need to test each part of
the system in isolation, so you can point at a specific part of the
system and say, *that*'s where at least some uncertainty which an
adversary can not reverse engineer, and here is the physical process
from which the [chaotic] air patterns, or quantum effects, etc., which
is hypothesized to cause the uncertainty.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Müller has done most or all of the testing Ts'o suggested as reported in
his paper.  The results seem to bear out some kind of random noise in both
the memory access and folding operations.  But Anvin's opinion that the jitter
in modern CPUs just represents a complicated PRNG space seems to have held
the day.  Perhaps a further look at the testing results is in order.
</p>

<p>
The reliance of the jitter RNG on a high-resolution timer makes it
unsuitable for Engel's embedded use case (as some of those systems lack
such a timer), so it's not at all clear where
things go from here.  Ts'o is not opposed to adding something as a
zero-entropy source to try to get better <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> numbers
earlier in the boot.  Since Engel's solution is both simpler and does not
rely on a high-resolution timer, it may well get the nod.

If your code requires -O0, you're doing something wrong.<br>

Instead of using -O0, it's better to use compiler barriers, like OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR (see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/fe8c8a126806fe">https://git.kernel.org/linus/fe8c8a126806fe</a>).<br>

Having a little experience with hardware random generation, the difficulty is that it is only possible to prove that there is some degree of predictability in the data.<br>
<p>
There's no test that will definitively measure 'randomness', only tests that might identify aspects that are not random.  If you pass all those tests, it does not mean it's unpredictable just that your tests did not hit the nail that may be sticking up somewhere.<br>
<p>
Statistical and correlation tests like dieharder are useful but it's possible a totally predictable prng could pass the whole suite.<br>
<p>
So this is a really hard problem...<br>

I wonder how much of this problem and the math behind it overlaps with radio signal processing, it seems that a random generator is similar to the random noise one finds in the electromagnetic spectrum that all sorts of different encodings and techniques like spread spectrum are able to push signal through.  If you could give your randomness detector a recording of a radio transmission through heavy noise and have it detect the transmission then maybe it is useful, but definitely not if it can't detect it.<br>

For randomness used for crypto the basic issue is unpredictability and statistical quality (eg, spectral whiteness) of the output.<br>
<p>
For demodulation of radio signals the kind of coding and the ratio of the signal to the noise decide what will be possible.  Crapping on the signal with a square wave that has no entropy is also able to mess up demodulation so it proves nothing about your generator quality.<br>

It seems the only way is to have reasonable stories about where the randomness is ultimately supposed to be coming from, what steps you took to sample it and reject outside influence, why the rate you are sampling it is slower than the underlying mechanism that creates the unpredictability for all cases (temperature, idle machine for the one in the article etc), why the result will be completely unbiased sampling between 0 and 1, then check it through the statistical test suites and publish the results.<br>
<p>
At least for assessing the generator, tricks like passing it through a hash first just hide information about problems and biases in the generator itself are just making it harder to believe the underlying quality is high.<br>

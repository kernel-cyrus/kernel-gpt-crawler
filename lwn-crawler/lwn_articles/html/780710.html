           </div>
Concurrency is hard even when the hardware's behavior is entirely
deterministic; it gets harder in situations where operations can be
reordered in seemingly random ways.  In these cases, developers tend to
reach for barriers as a way of enforcing ordering, but explicit barriers
are tricky to use and are often not the best way to think about the
problem.  It is thus common to see explicit barriers removed as code
matures.  That now seems to be happening with an especially obscure
type of barrier used with memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) operations.
<p>
The core idea behind MMIO is that a peripheral device makes a set of
registers available on the system's memory bus.  The kernel can map those
registers into its address space, then control the device by reading and
writing those registers.  I/O buses have often taken liberties with
ordering when it comes to delivering operations to peripherals; that leads
to rituals like performing an unneeded read from a PCI device's register
space to force previous writes to be posted.  But in some cases, the
hardware can take things further and reorder operations arriving from
different CPUs, even if the code performing those operations is strictly
ordered.  That, of course, can lead to a variety of amusing mixups.
<p>
Fortunately, kernel developers tend <i>not</i> to be amused by such things,
so they take steps to ensure that this type of reordering does not happen.
Back in 2004, Jesse Barnes <a href="/Articles/103183/">introduced a special
sort of memory barrier operation</a> called <tt>mmiowb()</tt>; its job was
to ensure that all MMIO writes initiated prior to the barrier would be
posted to the device before any writes initiated after the barrier.
<tt>mmiowb()</tt> was duly adopted by developers whose code needs to run on
the affected hardware; there are now several hundred call sites in the
kernel.
<p>
Explicit barrier operations can work, but they have their pitfalls.
Developers must remember to insert barrier operations anywhere that
reordering could cause things to go astray.  That tempts developers to
sprinkle them throughout the code without necessarily thinking about
exactly what those barriers are protecting against.  In normal use,
barriers need to come in groups of two or more, one in each place where a
race might happen, but there is no indication of
where any given barrier's siblings have been placed in the code, making it
harder to understand what is going on.  Code relying on explicit barriers,
as a result, can be subject to rare failures that are nearly impossible
to reproduce or diagnose.
<p>
Will Deacon would like to improve this situation.  He recently posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190222185026.10973-1-will.deacon@arm.com/">a patch
set</a> wherein <tt>mmiowb()</tt> is said to stand for "Mysterious Macro
Intended to Obscure Weird Behaviors"; his objective is to remove this
macro, or at least hide it from the view of most developers.  The core idea
is one that comes up often in software development: developers should not be
counted on to get complex concurrency issues right, especially in
situations where the computer can do it for them.
<p>
MMIO registers must be protected from concurrent accesses by multiple CPUs
in the system; if that hasn't been done, there is nothing that barriers can
do to stave off disaster.  In the kernel, the implication is that code
performing MMIO must be holding a spinlock that will prevent other
processors from getting in the way.  Spinlocks have already been defined as
barriers when it comes to access to system RAM, freeing most kernel code
from having to worry about memory-ordering issues in spinlock-protected
code.  Deacon's plan is to extend this definition to MMIO ordering on
systems that need it.
<p>
The patch set creates a per-CPU array of structures like:
<p>
<pre>
    struct mmiowb_state {
	u16	nesting_count;
	u16	mmiowb_pending;
    };
</pre>
<p>
Then, three sets of hooks are placed in the low-level spinlock and MMIO
code.  The functions that acquire spinlocks will call this function after
the acquisition succeeds:
<p>
<pre>
    static inline void mmiowb_spin_lock(void)
    {
	if (__this_cpu_inc_return(__mmiowb_state.nesting_count) == 1)
	    __this_cpu_write(__mmiowb_state.mmiowb_pending, 0);
    }
</pre>
<p>
This function increments <tt>nesting_count</tt>, which is essentially
keeping track of the number of spinlocks currently held by each CPU.  When
the first lock is acquired (when <tt>nesting_count</tt> is incremented to
one), the <tt>mmiowb_pending</tt> flag is set to zero, indicating that no
MMIO write operations have (yet) been performed in this critical section.
<p>
While I/O memory looks like memory, and it can be tempting to access it
by simply dereferencing a pointer, that does not always work on every
architecture, so kernel developers use helper functions instead.  Deacon's
patch set adds a call to <tt>mmiowb_set_pending()</tt> to the helpers that
perform write
operations; it simply sets the <tt>mmiowb_pending</tt> flag to one,
indicating that MMIO write operations have been performed since the last
time it was cleared.
<p>
Finally, operations that release a spinlock will call:
<p>
<pre>
    static inline void mmiowb_spin_unlock(void)
    {
	if (__this_cpu_xchg(__mmiowb_state.mmiowb_pending, 0))
	    mmiowb();
	__this_cpu_dec_return(__mmiowb_state.nesting_count);
    }
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>mmiowb_pending</tt> is set back to zero and simultaneously
tested; if its previous value was non-zero, <tt>mmiowb()</tt> is called.
Then the nesting count is decremented.
<p>
With these changes in place, there is no longer any need for driver-level
code to make explicit calls to <tt>mmiowb()</tt>.  That will, instead,
happen automatically whenever MMIO operations have been performed inside a
spinlock-protected critical section.  That frees driver authors from the
need to think about whether MMIO barriers are needed in any given
situation.  It also ensures that code will do the right thing, even if it
is written by a developer who tests on machines with stricter MMIO-ordering
guarantees and who has never even heard of <tt>mmiowb()</tt>.
<p>
It is thus unsurprising that nobody has spoken out against these changes,
even though the patch set modifies 178 files.  Linus Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgamK0=rNsCfDfDzmNXUF_MqUHb0okzqN1Tir9vm65pNg@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
"<q>I love removing mmiowb()</q>"; he did, however, have some
comments on how to make the implementation a bit more efficient.  A
revision of the patch set can thus be expected; after that, chances are
that <tt>mmiowb()</tt> calls (and MMIO-barrier-related weird behavior) in driver
code will soon be a thing of the past.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Wouldn't this misplace the mmiowb() if you have code that holds some other spinlock before and after it holds the spinlock that prevents other processors from accessing the device? I don't see why any nested spinlocks would necessarily be inside rather than outside the critical section for mmio. It seems like it would be more accurate to annotate spinlocks that protect mmio, and do a barrier when releasing these, and complain if mmio is done without holding any annotated spinlocks.<br>

      It might cause an extra <tt>mmiowb()</tt> if more MMIO is done after the inner spinlock is released, but the results should be correct in all cases if I understand things correctly.

Oh, nevermind, I was thinking the test in mmiowb_spin_unlock() was for nesting_count dropping to 0, parallel to clearing it when nesting_count went above 0.<br>
<p>
But now I'm unsure why we need to track nesting_count at all, and clear mmiowb_pending at the start of an unnested spinlock. Surely nesting_count could only be 0 if either the CPU has never had a spinlock or it released a spinlock since it last did mmio?<br>

<p>
The Linux kernel scheduler is a complicated beast
and a lot of effort goes into improving it during every kernel release
cycle. The 5.4 kernel release includes a few improvements to the existing
<TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> scheduling policy that can help users improve the
scheduling latency of their high-priority (interactive) tasks if they use
the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy for the lowest-priority (background)
tasks.
</p>

<h4>Scheduling classes and policies</h4>

<p>
The scheduler implements many "scheduling classes", an extensible
hierarchy of modules, and each class may further encapsulate
"scheduling policies" that are handled by the scheduler core in a
policy-independent way.
The scheduling classes are described below in descending priority order;
the Stop class has the highest priority, and Idle class has the
lowest. 

<p>
The <b>Stop</b> scheduling class is a special class that is used internally
by the kernel. It doesn't implement any scheduling policy and no user task
ever gets scheduled with it. The Stop class is, instead, a mechanism to force
a CPU to stop running everything else and perform a specific task. As this
is the highest-priority class, it can preempt everything else and nothing
ever preempts it.  It is used by one CPU to stop another in order to run a
specific function, so it is only available on SMP systems. The Stop class
creates a single, per-CPU kernel thread (or kthread) named
<tt>migration/N</tt>, where <tt>N</tt> is the CPU number.  This class is
used by the kernel for task migration, CPU hotplug, RCU, ftrace, clock
events, and more.

<p>
The <b>Deadline</b> scheduling class implements a single scheduling policy,
<a href="/Articles/743740/"><TT>SCHED_DEADLINE</TT></a>, and it handles the
highest-priority user tasks in the system.  It is used for tasks with hard
deadlines, like video encoding and decoding. The task with the earliest
deadline is served first under this policy. The policy of a task can be set
to <TT>SCHED_DEADLINE</TT> using the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setattr.2.html"><tt>sched_setattr()</tt></a>
system call by passing three parameters: the run time, deadline, and
period. 

<p> To ensure deadline-scheduling guarantees, the kernel
must prevent situations where the current set of <tt>SCHED_DEADLINE</tt>
threads is not schedulable within the given constraints. The kernel thus
performs an admittance test when setting or changing
<tt>SCHED_DEADLINE</tt> policy and attributes.  This admission test
calculates whether the change can be successfully scheduled; if not,
<tt>sched_setattr()</tt> fails with the error <tt>EBUSY</tt>.

<p>
The POSIX realtime (or <b>RT</b>) scheduling class comes after the deadline
class and is used for short, latency-sensitive tasks, like IRQ
threads. This is a fixed-priority class that schedules higher-priority
tasks before lower-priority tasks. It implements two scheduling policies:
<TT>SCHED_FIFO</TT> and <TT>SCHED_RR</TT>. In <TT>SCHED_FIFO</TT>, a task
runs until it relinquishes the CPU, either because it blocks for a
resource or it has completed its execution. In <TT>SCHED_RR</TT>
(round-robin), a task will run for the maximum time slice; if the task
doesn't block before the end of its time slice, the scheduler will put it
at the end of the round-robin queue of tasks with the same priority and
select the next task to run. The priority of the tasks under the realtime
policies range from 1 (low) to 99 (high).

<p>
The <b>CFS</b> (completely fair scheduling) class hosts most of the user
tasks; it implements three scheduling policies: <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT>,
<TT>SCHED_BATCH</TT>, and <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT>. A task under any of these
policies gets a chance to run only if no other tasks are enqueued in the
deadline or realtime classes (though by default the scheduler reserves 5% of the CPU
for CFS tasks regardless).  The scheduler tracks the virtual
runtime (vruntime) for all tasks, runnable and blocked. The lower a task's
vruntime, the more deserving the task is for time on the processor. CFS
accordingly moves low-vruntime tasks toward the front of the scheduling
queue.

<p>
The priority of a task is calculated by adding 120 to its nice
value, which ranges from -20 to +19. The priority of the task is used to
set the weight of the task, which in turn affects the vruntime of the task;
the lower the nice value, the higher the priority.  The task's weight will
thus be higher, and its vruntime will increase more slowly as the task runs.

<p>
The <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> policy (called <TT>SCHED_OTHER</TT> in user
space) is used for most of the tasks that run in a Linux environment, like
the shell. The <TT>SCHED_BATCH</TT> policy is used for batch processing by
non-interactive tasks — tasks that should run uninterrupted for a
period of time and hence are normally scheduled only after
finishing all the <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> activity. The <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT>
policy is designed for the lowest-priority tasks in the system; these tasks
get a chance to run only if there is nothing else to run. Though, in
practice, even in the presence of other <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> tasks a
<TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> task will get some time to run (around 1.4% for a task
with a nice value of zero). This policy isn't widely used currently and
efforts are being made to improve how it works.

<p>
Last is the <b>Idle</b> scheduling class (which should not be confused with
the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> scheduling policy). This is the lowest-priority
scheduling class; like the Stop class, it doesn't manage any
user tasks and so doesn't implement a policy. It only keeps a single per-CPU
kthread which is named <tt>swapper/N</tt>, where N is the CPU number. These
kthreads are also called the "idle threads" and aren't visible to
user space. These threads are responsible for saving system power by putting the
CPUs into deep idle states when there is no work to do.

<h4>Scheduling classes in the kernel</h4>

<p>
The scheduling classes are represented by <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4-rc8/source/kernel/sched/sched.h#L1701"><tt>struct
sched_class</tt></a> in the kernel source code:

<p>
<pre>
    struct sched_class {
	const struct sched_class *next;
	void (*enqueue_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p, int flags);
	void (*dequeue_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p, int flags);
	struct task_struct *(*pick_next_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *prev, 
			    struct rq_flags *rf);
	/* many fields omitted */
    };
</pre>

<p>
This structure mostly consists of function pointers (callbacks) to
class-specific implementations that are called by the scheduler core in a
class-independent manner. The classes are kept in a singly linked list in
descending order of their priorities; the head node points to the Stop
scheduling class (highest priority) and the last node in the list points to
the Idle class (lowest priority).

<p>

<blockquote>

class="photo">
</blockquote>

<p>
The Linux kernel calls <tt>schedule()</tt> when it needs to pick a new task
to run on the local CPU, which further calls <tt>pick_next_task()</tt> to
find the next task.  <tt>pick_next_task()</tt> traverses the list of
scheduling classes, with the help of the <tt>for_each_class()</tt> macro,
to find the highest-priority scheduling class that has a task available to
run. Once a task is found, it is returned to the caller, which then runs it
on the local CPU. There should always be a task available to run in the
Idle class, which will run only if there is nothing else to run.

<h4><tt>SCHED_IDLE</tt> improvements</h4>

<p>
The CFS scheduler tries to be fair to all tasks by giving more CPU time
to the higher-priority tasks as compared to the lower-priority tasks. It
normally doesn't provide special treatment to tasks based on their
scheduling policy, for example tasks running under the <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> and
<TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policies are managed in the same way. They are all kept
in the same CFS run queues, the load and utilization of the CPUs change in
the same way for all the tasks, and the <a href="/Articles/531853/">PELT</a>
signal and CPU-frequency changes are impacted similarly by all 
tasks. The only differentiating factor is the priority (derived from the
nice value) of the tasks, which affects the weight of the tasks.
<p>
The weight
of a task defines how the load and utilization of the CPU will change
because of that task. For this reason, we don't see a lot of
<TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy-related code in the CFS scheduler. As the
<TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy tasks have the lowest priority, they
automatically get scheduled for the least amount of time. Also, since
there aren't many known users of the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy in the
Linux community, no one attempted to improve it since it
was first <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0e6aca43e08a">introduced</a> in Linux
2.6.23. 

<p>
When a newly woken-up task is available to run, the scheduler core finds
the target run queue (i.e. a CPU to run it on) by calling the
<tt>select_task_rq()</tt> callback of the respective scheduling
class. This callback returns the CPU where the task should be
enqueued. Once the task is enqueued there, the scheduler checks
if that task should preempt the currently running task on that
CPU by calling the <tt>check_preempt_curr()</tt> callback of the
respective scheduling class.

<p>
Until now, the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy was getting special treatment
only in the <tt>check_preempt_curr()</tt> callback, where a currently
running <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> task will be immediately preempted by a newly
woken-up <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> task. But this preemption will only happen 
if the newly woken-up task is enqueued on a CPU that is running a
<TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> task currently.  As there was no special handling of
the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy in the <tt>select_task_rq()</tt> callback,
there was no specific effort made to enqueue the newly woken-up
<TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> task on a CPU running a <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> task.

<p>
Normally, the scheduler tries to spread tasks across the available CPUs by
searching for an idle CPU for newly woken-up tasks. The 5.4 kernel
contains a <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1561523542.git.viresh.kumar@linaro.org/">patch
set</a> that makes the necessary changes to the CFS scheduler's
<tt>select_task_rq()</tt> callback to queue tasks more aggressively on 
CPUs that are running only <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> tasks, even if a few CPUs are
currently idle. There are two separate code paths in the CFS
<tt>select_task_rq()</tt> callback: the slow path and the fast path.  The
slow path is mostly executed for newly forked tasks, where it tries to find
the optimal CPU to run the task on.  The fast path, instead, is
taken for existing tasks that have become runnable again; it tries to find
a target CPU (an idle CPU if possible) as soon as possible even if it is
not the optimal one.

<p>
Both these code paths were updated by the new patch set to consider a CPU
that is running only <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> tasks as equivalent to an idle
CPU. The scheduler now prefers to queue the newly woken-up tasks on CPUs
with only <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> activity; the newly queued task will
immediately preempt the currently running <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> task when
<tt>check_preempt_curr()</tt> is called.  This reduces the scheduling
latency for the newly queued task as compared to selecting a fully idle
CPU, as we don't need to bring an idle CPU out of its deep idle state, which
normally takes a few milliseconds to complete.

<h4>The results of this change</h4>

<p>
This patch set was initially tested with 
<a href="https://github.com/scheduler-tools/rt-app">rt-app</a> on an arm64
octa-core HiKey platform, where all the CPUs change frequency together. 
Rt-app is a test application that starts multiple periodic threads in order
to simulate a realtime periodic load. For this test, eight
<TT>SCHED_OTHER</TT> tasks and five <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> tasks were
created. The tasks weren't bound to any particular CPU and could be queued
anywhere by the scheduler. The <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> tasks executed (busy
loops) for 5333µs out of a period of 7777µs, while the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT>
tasks kept on running forever. The idea was to check whether the
<TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> tasks were being scheduled together (thus preempting
each other) or if they were able to preempt <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> tasks instead.
The result showed that the average scheduling
latency (<tt>wu_lat</tt> field in rt-app results) for the
<TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> tasks reduced to 102µs after the patch set was
applied, down from 1116µs without the patch set; that was a reduction of 90%
in scheduling latency for the <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> tasks, which looks
quite encouraging.

<p>
Further testing showed that the average scheduling latency of a
<TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> task, on the above-mentioned arm64 platform is 64µs
when it preempts a <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> task, 177µs when it runs on a
shallow-idle (no cluster idle) CPU, and 307µs when it runs on a deep-idle
(cluster idle) CPU.  The same behavior can be observed with the kernel
function tracer; the traces are shown below with help of the <a
href="https://kernelshark.org/">KernelShark</a> tool.  First, the output
from the 5.3 kernel:

<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="/Articles/805389/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/v5.3-kshark-sm.png"
alt="[KernelShark output]" border=0 class="photo"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you look closely at the above figure, you can see that occasionally, for
long periods of time, a few CPUs were running a single task (solid
single-color lines) without being preempted by another task. The
long-running tasks are the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> tasks which should ideally
be preempted by the <TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> tasks, but that wasn't happening
then.

<p>
The results from the 5.4 kernel are different:

<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="/Articles/805389/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/v5.4-kshark-sm.png"
alt="[KernelShark output]" border=0 class="photo"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you look closely at the above figure, you can see that the pattern is
quite consistent now. The <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> tasks are preempted by the
<TT>SCHED_NORMAL</TT> tasks as soon as one is available to run, which then
runs for 5333µs and then gives the CPU back to a <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT>
task.  This is exactly the behavior this patch set was meant to create.

<h4>Other applications</h4>

<p>
Recently, Song Liu was trying to solve a <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190408214539.2705660-1-songliubraving@fb.com/">problem</a>
seen on servers at Facebook. The servers running latency-sensitive
workloads usually weren't fully loaded for various reasons, including
disaster readiness. The machines running Facebook's interactive workloads
(referred as the main workload) have a lot of spare CPU cycles that they
would like to use for opportunistic side jobs like video encoding. However,
Liu's experiments showed that the side workload has a strong impact on the
latency of main workload.  Liu was asked to try the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT>
patch set and he <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/2E7A1CDA-0384-474E-9011-5B209A1A58DF@fb.com/">found</a>
that it solved the problems he was facing to a great extent; though he
tested an earlier version of the patch set where only the fast path was
updated.

<p>
Another potential user of this work is the Android operating system,
which has knowledge about the importance of a task for the current user's
experience ranging from "background" (not important) to "top-app" (most
important). The <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy can potentially be used for all
the background tasks as that would increase the probability of finding an
idle CPU for top-app tasks by preempting the background tasks.

<p>
Clearly this work has a lot of potential. More mainstream products
should be using the <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy, though there may be a need
for more <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> policy-specific optimizations in the CFS
scheduler for that. One such optimization is under <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/b90cbcce608cef4e02a7bbfe178335f76d201bab.1573728344.git.viresh.kumar@linaro.org/">discussion</a>
right now on the kernel mailing list, where I am trying to be more
aggressive in selecting a <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> CPU in both the slow and fast
paths of the CFS scheduler. Also, improvements can be made to the CFS load
balancer, which doesn't give any special treatment to the
<TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> CPUs currently and rather attempts to spread the tasks
to all the CPUs; that is future work, though.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Wake/fork/exec used to be treated equally from CFS's point of view, but slow-path'ing on every wakeup was a bit too aggressive. See 182a85f8a119 ("sched: Disable wakeup balancing").<br>
<p>
Also worth noting it is somewhat topology-dependant: on Arm big.LITTLE we *do* go through the slow-path on regular wakeups, because we value picking the right CPU.<br>

RT or Deadline scheduler classes and their code is completely separate from CFS and they have their own versions of select_task_rq() callback. The changes to the CFS code thus won't impact the RT or DL tasks at all. The RT/DL task will run for as long as they want (leaving 5% of CPU time to CFS) and won't care if the CFS task was SCHED_OTHER or SCHED_IDLE. So we should see solid color lines for RT and DL tasks for as long as they run :)<br>

      <p>Indeed, Facebook could have solved this much more cheaply by using MuQSS, where <TT>SCHED_IDLE</TT> and <TT>SCHED_ISO</TT> have always worked as advertised.</p>

<p>A single host <b>really can</b> handle latency-sensitive applications (e.g., live audio effects box) while running compile jobs in the background. All CPUs stay pegged the whole time, processes barely migrate at all (unlike CFS), and as long as my SATA controller is disabled in the BIOS, I can do all the audio processing I want with 2.6ms round-trip latency and no dropouts for literally <b>weeks</b>.</p>

<p>I can't get that performance out of a stock kernel, no matter how it's configured, no matter how much CPU isolation or rtirq fiddling I do, or what hardware I disable. If I'm willing to waste a couple of weeks, I can get an <i>almost</i> reliable low-latency system with an -rt kernel, which will perform worse for batch workloads. Or I can use MuQSS and get better performance for literally everything.</p>

<p>I just can't run docker. Boo-freaking-hoo.</p>

The MuQSS CPU scheduler<br>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/720227/">https://lwn.net/Articles/720227/</a><br>
..."BFS does away with explicit CPU load rebalancing algorithms between CPUs, instead opting for selecting the CPU for task execution when scheduling every process that wakes up. The global run queue will select an available idle CPU for the next task that is ready to run. When selecting a CPU, the scheduler will try to select the last CPU the task was running on. Failing that, the CPU selection moves "outward", next trying any hyperthreaded or core siblings that share cache. CPUs in different sockets or on different NUMA nodes are treated as "cache distant", and are the least preferred when selecting a CPU for a task to run on.<br>
<p>
Other simplifications in the design of BFS include the elimination of most of the tunable knobs and the lack of support for control groups. Kolivas argues that these are features desktop users have no interest in, and an excess of tuning knobs just creates confusion."<br>

That's been my experience too. I used to run Folding@Home, which is entirely CPU-bound code heavily reliant on message passing between threads. CFS at the time never managed to show CPU usage above 75% (and was even worse without manual cpufreq management), BFS just worked.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately it's gathering bugs as the sole developer slowly burns out. It doesn't work with cpufreq-schedutil (stuck at max frequency) and enabling /proc/pressure/ leads to serious problems. Hopefully by the time it stops working entirely, CFS will have caught up to where it was 12 years ago.<br>

Hmmm...  Well, in your defense, it does #include &lt;linux/stop_machine.h&gt; for no reason that I am aware of.  Twice, even!  Let's try removing those #include directives.  Builds the kernel/rcu directory without error, so let's try rcutorture.  Which passes.<br>

So I have queued this change with Viresh's Reported-by, thank you!  :-)<br>

I think I picked this thing up from some other presentation I read long back and never confirmed it with code.<br>
<p>
Now that I looked at git history I found this:<br>
<p>
commit 6587a23b6b9b ("rcu: Switch synchronize_sched_expedited() to IPI"), dated Aug 6 2015.<br>
<p>
So we used to use Stop class until 2015 :)<br>
<p>
Will make sure this doesn't come again in any of my presentation/papers :)<br>
<p>
Thanks for the patch.<br>

No worries!  After all, in the Linux kernel as much as elsewhere, change is the only constant.<br>

Well, aside from things like not breaking userspace.  And not allowing RCU readers to span a grace period.  And...  :-)<br>

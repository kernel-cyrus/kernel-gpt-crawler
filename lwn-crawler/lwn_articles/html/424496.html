<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 26, 2011</br>
           </div>
Power management is often seen as a concern mostly for embedded and mobile
systems.  They worry about power management because we want our phones
to run for longer between recharges and our laptops to not inflict burns on
our thighs.  But power management is equally important for data centers,
which are currently responsible for about 3% of the total power consumption
in the US.  Keeping the net going in the US requires about <strike>15TW</strike> 15GW of power -
the dedicated output of about 15 nuclear power plants.  Clearly there would
be some real value to saving some of that power.  Matthew Garrett's
talk during the Southern Plumbers Miniconf at linux.conf.au 2011 covered
the work that is being done in that area and where Linux stands relative to
other operating systems.
<p>

Much of the power consumed by data centers is not directly controllable by
Linux - it is overhead which is consumed outside of the computers
themselves.  About one watt of power is consumed by overhead for each watt
consumed by computation.  This overhead includes network infrastructure
and power supply loss, but the biggest component is air conditioning.  So
the obvious thing to do here is to create more efficient cooling and power
infrastructure.  Running at higher ambient temperatures, while
uncomfortable for humans, can also help.  The best contemporary data
centers have been able to reduce their overhead to about 20% - a big
improvement.  Cogeneration techniques - using heat from data centers to
warm buildings, for example - can reduce that overhead even further.
<p>
But we still have trouble.  A 48-core system, Matthew says, will draw about
350W when it is idle; a rack full of such systems will still pull a lot of
power.  What can be done?  Most power management attention has been focused
on the CPU, which is where a lot of the power goes.  As a result, an idle
Intel CPU now draws approximately zero watts of power - it is "terrifying"

<a href="/Articles/424500/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2011/lca/MatthewGarrett-sm.jpg" width=150 height=181
alt="[Matthew Garrett]" border=0 align="right" hspace=2></a>

how well it works.  When the CPU is working, though, the situation is a bit
different; the power consumption is about 20W per core, or about 960W for a
busy 48-core system.
<p>
The clear implication is that we should keep the CPUs idle whenever
possible.  That can be tricky, though; it is hard to write software which
does nothing.  Or - as Matthew corrected himself - it's hard to write
<i>useful</i> software which does nothing.
<p>
There are some trends which can be pointed to in this area.  CPU power
management is essentially solved; Linux is quite good at it.  In fact,
Linux is better than any other operating system with regard to CPU power;
we have more time in deep idle states and fewer wakeups than others.  So
interest is shifting toward memory power management.  If all of the CPUs in
a package within the system can be idled, the associated memory controller
will go idle as well.  It's also possible to put memory into "self-refresh"
mode if it is idle, reducing power use while preserving the contents.  In
other situations, running memory at a lower clock rate can reduce power
usage.  There will be a lot of work in this area because, at this point,
memory looks like the biggest, lowest-hanging fruit.
<p>
Even more power can be saved by simply turning a system off; that is where
virtualization comes into play.  If applications are run on virtualized
servers, those servers can be consolidated onto a small number of machines
during times of low load, allowing the other machines to be powered down.
There is a great deal of customer interest in this capability, but there is
still work to be done; in particular, we need fast guest migration, which
is a hard problem to solve.
<p>
The other hard problem is the fact that optimal power behavior may make
tradeoffs which enterprise customers may be unwilling to make.  Performance
matters for these people, and, if that means expending more energy, they
are willing to pay that cost.

As an example, consider the <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> system call which,
while having been ruthlessly optimized, can still be slower than some
people would like.  Simply reading the processor's time stamp counter (TSC)
can be faster.  The problem is that the TSC can become unreliable in the
presence of power management.  Once upon a time, changing the CPU frequency
would change the rate of the TSC, but that problem has been solved by the
CPU vendors for a few years now.  So TSC problems are no longer an excuse
to avoid lowering the clock frequency.
<p>
Unfortunately, that is not too useful, because it rarely makes sense to run
a CPU at a lower frequency; best results usually come from running at full
speed and spending more time in a sleep state ("C&nbsp;state").  But C
states can stop the TSC altogether, once again creating problems for
performance-sensitive 
users.  In response, manufacturers have caused the TSC to run even when the
CPU is sleeping.  So, while virtualization remains a hassle, systems
running on bare metal can expect the TSC to work properly in all power
management states.
<p>
But that still doesn't satisfy some performance-sensitive users because
deep C states create latency.  It can take a millisecond to wake a CPU out
of a deep sleep - that is a very long time in some applications.  We have
the <a href="/Articles/386139/">pm_qos mechanism</a> which can let the
kernel know whether deep sleeps are acceptable at any given time, allowing
power management to happen when latency is not an immediate concern.  Not a
perfect solution, but that may be as good as it gets for now.
<p>
Another interesting feature of contemporary CPUs is the "turbo" mode, which
can allow a CPU to run in an overclocked mode for a period of time.  Using
this mode can get work done faster, allowing longer sleeps and better power
behavior, but it depends on good power management if it is to work at all.
If a core is to run in turbo mode, all other cores on the same die must be
in a sleep state.  The end result is that turbo mode can give good results
for single-threaded workloads.
<p>
Some effort is going into powering down unused hardware components - I/O
controllers, for example - even though the gains to be had in this area are
relatively small.  Many systems have quite a few USB ports, many of which
are entirely unused.  Versions&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 of the USB specification
make powering down those port hard; even worse, those ports will repeatedly
wake the CPU even if nothing is plugged in.  USB&nbsp;3 is better in this
regard. 
<p>
Unfortunately, even in this case, it's hard to power down the ports because
it is a feature which is poorly specified, poorly documented, and poorly
implemented.  The reliability of the hardware varies; Windows tends not to
use the PCI power management event infrastructure, so it often simply does
not work.  This problem has been solved by polling the hardware once every
second; that is "the least bad thing" they could come up with.  The result
is better power behavior, but also up to one second of latency before the
system responds to the plugging-in of a new USB device.  Since, as Matthew
noted, that one second is probably less than the user already lost while
trying to insert the plug upside-down, it shouldn't be a problem.
<p>
Similar things can be done with other types of hardware - firewire ports,
audio devices, SD ports, etc.  It's just a matter of figuring out how to
make it work.  There is also some interest in reducing the power
consumption of graphics processors (GPUs), even though enterprise systems
tend not 
to have fancy GPUs.  The level of support varies from one GPU to the next,
but work is being done to improve power consumption for most of them.
<p>
 Work for the future includes
better CPU frequency governor development; we need to do better at ramping
up the processor's frequency when there is work to be done.  The scheduler
needs tweaks to do a better job of consolidating jobs onto one package,
allowing others to be powered down.  And there is the continued
exploitation of other power management features in hardware; there are a
lot of them that we are not using.  On the other hand, others are not using
those features either, so they probably do not work.
<p>
In summary: Linux is doing pretty well with regard to enterprise-level
power management; the GPU is the only place where we perform worse than
Windows does.  But we can always do better, so work will continue in that
direction.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
From all I could find on the web about Turbo mode, the policy all seems to be done "automatically" by the hardware. If true, this seems like the worst design decision ever. At best, surely the kernel would be able to do a much better job with the extra context it has about the workload. At worst, doesn't this cause absolute havoc with the kernel's scheduler?<br>

Right, but that just appears as another P state to the OS - it's entirely possible that the BIOS will have programmed that before the OS asserts any control over the functionality. The problem with turbo mode is that without knowing the full state of the processor (the C state of every thread, the temperature of every sensor, the current power draw of every core) and without knowing the algorithms used (which the vendors consider secret), the OS has no way of knowing whether asking for the highest performance state will give it performance identical to the next highest state, or anywhere up to 60% higher.<br>

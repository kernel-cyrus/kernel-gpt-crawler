<h1>In search of the right RGB LED interface</h1>

<p>One of the roles of the Linux kernel is to provide uniform, abstract
interfaces to varying hardware.  When a new class of hardware comes
along, it can take a while to understand what the best interface would
be.  This has been seen in recent months with the appearance of nonvolatile
memory 
in large quantities leading to disagreements over the semantics of DAX
filesystem access and the handling of hardware errors.  The same basic
question has arisen, though in a much smaller way, over the best
handling of RGB LEDs — triplets of LEDs, each of a different color, which
together can produce a wide range of colors and intensities.</p>

<p>Linux already has support for monochrome LEDs, including minimal
support for identifying the color of each LED: the name of the LED
can, and sometimes does, include the English name of the LED's color
(<tt>locomo:green:mail</tt>, for example).
The simplest approach to managing RGB LEDs is to treat them as
three independent LEDs with related names.  User-space tools can then
follow simple conventions to find related LEDs and create interesting
colors as required.</p>

<p>There are two reasons to think this may not be the best long-term
solution.  The first involves integration with the various &quot;triggers&quot;
that Linux supports for LEDs.  As Jacek Anaszewski from Samsung
<a href="http://mid.gmane.org/5714A502.9030201@samsung.com">explains</a>,
there are two classes of source information for triggers. 
One class has the trigger local to the LED, such as &quot;timer&quot; or
&quot;<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/508810/">oneshot</a>&quot;.  These
triggers are controlled from user space;
programming three triggers in concert might be a little clumsy,  but it still
allows the full functionality to be used.</p>

<p>The other class of source information is from in-kernel events: CPU
load, disk drive activity, network device activity, etc.  These
currently only adjust the brightness or the duty-cycle of the LEDs, but
a natural enhancement would be to allow them to adjust color.  That
would require the kernel to know how specific LEDs work together to
produce different colors.  A particular example is the heartbeat
trigger.  On monochrome LEDs this trigger produces a
&quot;<a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/leds/trigger/ledtrig-heartbeat.c?id=b562e44f507e863c6792946e4e1b1449fbbac85d#n44">thump-thump-pause</a>&quot;
pattern designed to mimic the human heartbeat 
with a rate that increases as the load-average on the system
increases.  Heiner Kallweit has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.leds/4716">implemented</a> an alternate heartbeat
that works with RGB LEDs and uses the color (ranging from green to
red) rather than the rate to represent load.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine other ways that color information could be used
to represent such things as acceptable or worrisome activity from
various parts of the kernel.  Supporting direct connections from those
subsystems to a suitable RGB LED may provide a lot of value.</p>

<p>The second reason that the kernel might benefit from an explicit
understanding that three LEDs work together is that this understanding
is embedded in some hardware.  A good example is the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lp5523.pdf">LP5523 LED
controller [PDF]</a> from TI that can drive up to nine LEDs.  This
controller is programmable with three separate engines and space to
store 96 16-bit instructions.  The instructions are general enough to
be usable for <a href="http://pavelmachek.livejournal.com/120188.html">computing prime numbers</a>.  The three engines naturally align
with three sets of RGB LEDs, so allowing the kernel interface to
represent these triples is likely to make for a better interface.
Even when the LEDs are only accessed from user space, it would be helpful if
high-level program requests, such as blink rates or brightness
transitions, could be described for the three together so they can
reliably be synchronized.</p>

<p>As yet there does not seem to be a clear vision for how generic RGB
support might work.  Kallweit posted <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/56D608ED.2090406@gmail.com">some patches</a> back in March but
they have some problems.  The basic approach is to present the three
LEDs as a single LED device that changes all three colors at the same
time, so it can be used as though it were a single white LED.  The
&quot;brightness&quot; value can be given hue and saturation components as
well; this allows color to be changed from user space.
This triplet of values is encoded in a single sysfs attribute which,
as Pavel Machek <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/20160329100258.GA24964@amd">highlighted</a>, is
not generally seen as acceptable.</p> 

<p>One argument against this approach is that there are already devices
with tri-color LEDs, such as the Nokia N900 and the motion controller
for the Sony PlayStation.  These currently use three separate LED
devices and they need to be able to continue to work the same way when
new functionality is added.</p>

<p>Using HSV (Hue Saturation Value) has some appeal as it includes the
current brightness as a subset but, for correct mapping to RGB, a
&quot;gamma&quot; value needs to be included, and the kernel may not be the best
place to be adding that sort of complexity.</p>

<p>After some discussion, Anaszewski came up with a <a
href="http://mid.gmane.org/5714A502.9030201@samsung.com">proposal</a> that
could 
make triggers like the color-based load indicator work with individual
red, green, and blue LEDs.  A single trigger can already apply to
multiple LEDs, so the first step would be to assign that colorful
&quot;heartbeat&quot; to each of the three LEDs.  Then a new sysfs attribute
would be used to configure each one to only display the &quot;red&quot;,
&quot;green&quot;, or &quot;blue&quot; component of the signal.  While this feels a little
clumsy, it would certainly work and is simple to implement and to
understand, which are more important considerations.</p>

<p>This doesn't really address the need to be able to program controllers
that expect LEDs to be related rather than completely independent.
Machek has <a href="http://mid.gmane.org/20160401135748.GD11860@amd">some ideas</a> on how that might be approached.  There isn't
a lot of detail; it essentially involves creating a new &quot;pattern&quot;
device in sysfs that represents the capabilities for the engine in
the controller.  It can be configured and then linked to one or more
LED devices.  This model seems flexible enough to be able to support
both software and hardware pattern generators, but without more
details (and code) it is hard to judge it fairly.</p>

<p>
Keeping the individual LEDs separate, but allowing them to be combined for
pattern generation, seems to be a fairly accurate model of how the hardware
works, as there is nothing in the hardware controller that forces the LEDs
to be mounted close to each other physically.  This match between model and
reality bodes well for the design being one that could be successful.</p>

<p>While little details like RGB LEDs might not get as much attention as
big-ticket items like massive nonvolatile RAM arrays, they are still quite
important as they are exactly the sort of thing we can expect to see
more of in the mobile-device space.  If we ever want these devices to
run mainline kernels, we would do well to work on getting support of
these devices into mainline first.  Or at least a close second.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Not to forget that there are also things like RGBW LEDs, whose relationship between RGB intensity and the corresponding "white" tends to be somewhat hardware specific, regardless of the requiremen for gamma correction.<br>
Or RG LEDs (i.e. just red/green).<br>
<p>
Thus, more involved color calculations really don't belong in the kernel.<br>
<p>
What I would like to see, however, is a way to atomically (or even mostly-atomically) change more than one LED from userspace.<br>

We've had the same issue here with a bicolour LED, than can be used to provide 4 colours (off, red, green and orange).<br>
<p>
I did this by modifying the standard LED driver to allow for one kernel LED device to control more than one GPIO output. I then use the 'brightness' parameter of this LED to control which GPIO lines are triggered (0 for off, 1 for red, 2 for green and 3 for both red and green, i.e. orange).<br>
<p>
This works well in our applications, and allows us to successfully provide an orange flash. Presiously, driving the two LEDs independently meant that when asking for an orange flash (i.e. red and green off simultaneously, then on simultaneously) meant that you might actually get them flashing out of sequence, so what you actually saw was a red to green flash.<br>

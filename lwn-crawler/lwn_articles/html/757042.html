We now have less than 20 years to wait until the <tt>time_t</tt> value used
on 32-bit systems will overflow and create time-related mayhem across the
planet.  The <a href="/Articles/643234/">grand plan for solving this
problem</a> was posted over three years ago now; progress since then has
seemed slow.  But quite a bit of work has happened deep inside the kernel
and, in 4.18, some of the first work that will be visible to user space has
been merged.  The year-2038 problem is not yet solved, but things are
moving in that direction.
<p>
If 32-bit systems are to be able to handle times after January 2038, they
will need to switch to a 64-bit version of the <tt>time_t</tt> type; the
kernel will obviously need to support applications using that new type.
Doing so in a way that doesn't 
break existing applications is going to require some careful work, though.
In particular, the kernel must be able to successfully run a system where
applications have been rebuilt to use a 64-bit <tt>time_t</tt>, but ancient
binaries stuck on 32-bit <tt>time_t</tt> still exist; both applications
should continue to work (though the old code may fail to handle times
correctly).
<p>
The first step is to recognize that most architectures already have support
for applications running in both 64-bit and 32-bit modes in the form of the
compatibility code used to run 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems.
At some point, all systems will be 64-bit systems when it comes to time
handling, so it makes sense to use the compatibility calls for older
applications even on 32-bit systems.  To that end, with 4.18, work has been
done to allow both 32-bit
and 64-bit versions of the time-related  system calls to be built on all
architectures.  The <tt>CONFIG_64BIT_TIME</tt> configuration symbol
controls the building of the 64-bit versions on 32-bit systems, while
<tt>CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME</tt> controls the 32-bit versions.
<p>
Internally, some work has been done to keep the handling of time formats as
simple as possible.  The new <tt>__kernel_timespec</tt> type describes how
64-bit <tt>timespec</tt> values will be passed between the kernel and user
space; it is designed to be the same for both 64-bit applications and those
running under 32-bit emulation.
<p>
The long-term plan for many system calls with year-2038 issues is to create
new versions, under new system-call numbers, that handle times in the
<tt>__kernel_timespec</tt> format.  The old versions, which will not handle
2038 correctly, will retain the old system-call numbers, so they will still
be there for applications that expect them.  Applications that are built
for 64-bit time values will use the new versions and function correctly.
For the most part, the patches for this phase of the work exist but have not yet
found their way into the mainline.
<p>
One set of system calls that <i>have</i> changed are those managing System V
interprocess communication.  These system calls, providing access to
semaphores, shared memory, and message queues, are not universally loved,
but they do have users and need to continue to work.  They also have
interfaces using <tt>time_t</tt> values.  For example, the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semctl.2.html"><tt>semctl()</tt></a>
system call uses the <tt>semid_ds</tt> structure, defined as:
<p>
<pre>
    struct semid_ds {
	struct ipc_perm sem_perm;  /* Ownership and permissions */
	time_t          sem_otime; /* Last semop time */
	time_t          sem_ctime; /* Last change time */
	unsigned long   sem_nsems; /* No. of semaphores in set */
    };
</pre>
<p>
This structure looks like it would be difficult to extend to 64-bit time
values without breaking compatibility, but the reality of the situation is
a good illustration of how the view of system calls provided by the
C&nbsp;library does not always match the actual interface provided by the
kernel.  The structure that is actually passed into and out of the kernel
is rather different; the C&nbsp;library takes responsibility for converting
between the two.  The kernel's structure looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct semid64_ds {
	struct ipc64_perm sem_perm;	/* permissions .. see ipc.h */
	__kernel_time_t	sem_otime;	/* last semop time */
	unsigned long	__unused1;
	__kernel_time_t	sem_ctime;	/* last change time */
	unsigned long	__unused2;
	unsigned long	sem_nsems;	/* no. of semaphores in array */
	unsigned long	__unused3;
	unsigned long	__unused4;
};
</pre>
<p>
This is the 32-bit version of the structure with some <tt>#ifdef</tt> lines
taken out; the full definition can be found in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/asm-generic/sembuf.h#L7"><tt>include/uapi/asm-generic/sembuf.h</tt></a>.
What jumps out here is the padding that exists between the time fields.
Somebody, years ago (before the beginning of the Git era) decided that the
kernel should use the <tt>semid64_ds</tt> structure on all systems, and to
ensure that enough space existed to pass 64-bit time values at some time in
the future.
<p>
Many years later, that decision is paying off.  In 4.18, the kernel will be
able to unconditionally return 64-bit times for <tt>sem_otime</tt> and
<tt>sem_ctime</tt>, with no compatibility issues to worry about.  To that
end, the structure (on 32-bit systems) now looks like:
<p>
<pre>
     struct semid64_ds {
	struct ipc64_perm sem_perm;	/* permissions .. see ipc.h */
	unsigned long	sem_otime;	/* last semop time */
	unsigned long	sem_otime_high;
	unsigned long	sem_ctime;	/* last change time */
	unsigned long	sem_ctime_high;
	unsigned long	sem_nsems;	/* no. of semaphores in array */
	unsigned long	__unused3;
	unsigned long	__unused4;
    };
</pre>
<p>

The extra bits in the <tt>_high</tt> fields will be ignored until the
C&nbsp;library is upgraded to use them, but that can happen independently.
There are some minor issues to be dealt with (the padding values are in the
wrong place on big-endian systems, necessitating a swap operation, for
example), but the change is essentially painless.
<p>
The one remaining piece, involving a bit more pain, is
<a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semop.2.html"><tt>semtimedop()</tt></a>,
which takes a <tt>struct timespec</tt> parameter. 
That call will have to be split into old and new versions, as described
above — a change that has not found its way into 4.18.
<p>

The merging of these changes for 4.18 shows that the work on the year-2038
problem is progressing.  There is still quite a bit to do; beyond the new
system calls, there are a bunch of <tt>ioctl()</tt> operations that will
need to be found and fixed, for example.  But, from the kernel point of
view at least, perhaps there is some light visible at the end of the
tunnel.  A complete solution will also require a lot of work at the
C-library, distribution, and application levels, though, so we are likely
to be hearing about year-2038 work for a while yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Out of curiosity, I checked the certificates in my Firefox browser. The "Amazon Root CA 1" certificate expires on January 17, 2038, just two days before the 32-bit rollover on January 19, 2038. Coincidence?<br>

That said, applications for this kind of work typically don't use time_t for such computations.<br>

Kernel-style <tt>time_t</tt> values are mostly useful for dealing with system-level stuff such as file access/modification/change times, process ages, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
If you're writing <em>applications</em> that, e.g., handle life insurance calculations, you don't want to do that based on <tt>time_t</tt> – most programming languages have date/time data types that are way more useful and robust.

      <p>I wonder what time representation "at" and "cron" use? Of course you probably will not schedule anything with them years ahead, but in principle it is possible. Out of curiosity tried what "at" does given a date in 2040, and it did not complain (on a 64-bit Linux Mint 18.3):
<pre>
$ at -f at-test.sh 12/12/2040
warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
job 1 at Wed Dec 12 11:48:00 2040
</pre>
<p>But I guess it is infeasible to wait until that to see if it really worked.

It's not that infeasible to test -- just set your system clock ahead a few decades.<br>

Also quite a bit less for people that run older kernels and/or provide long-term support.<br>

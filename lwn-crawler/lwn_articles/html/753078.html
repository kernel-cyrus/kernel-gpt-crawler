<a href="/Articles/lsfmm2018/">LSFMM</a>
</div>
Matthew "Willy" Wilcox has been doing a fair amount of work in the
memory-management area recently.  He showed up at the 2018 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit with a list of discussion topics
related to that work; it was enough to fill a plenary session with some
spillover into the memory-management track the next day.  Some of his
topics were fairly straightforward; others look to be somewhat more
involved.
<p>
He started the plenary session by noting that the "<tt>vm_fault_t</tt>
controversy" turned out to be rather more involved than he had expected; he
seemed to be referring to a disconnected series of patches (<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180421171442.GA17919@jordon-HP-15-Notebook-PC/">example</a>)
creating a new <tt>vm_fault_t</tt> typedef for page-fault handlers.  He has
been busy trying to run the resulting changes through the relevant
maintainers, but it has been some work; he didn't realize, he said, that
the filesystem developers would be so "<a
href="/Articles/753081/">belligerent</a>" about wanting to see the full
series — which doesn't exist yet.  In any case, he said, this is a boring
topic; the room seemed to agree, so he moved on.
<p>
He then put up an example of code performing a memory allocation, and pointed
out that it contained several bugs, including a missing overflow check and
a lack of type checking.  Bugs like this are fairly common in the kernel.
He proposes to handle that use case with a new
helper called <tt>kvmalloc_struct()</tt>, and is looking for feedback.  The
room didn't seem to find this topic to be worth arguing about either; Ted
Ts'o finally suggested that Wilcox should "paint it blue".
<p>
He then called for the addition of <tt>malloc()</tt> and <tt>free()</tt> to
the kernel API.  A call to <tt>malloc()</tt> would turn into a

<a href="/Articles/753086/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2018/lsfmm/MatthewWilcox-sm.jpg" alt="[Matthew Wilcox]"
title="Matthew Wilcox" class="rthumb"></a>

<tt>kvmalloc()</tt> call with the <tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt> flags.  His purpose
is to make it easier for new developers to write drivers by providing
something that is more similar to the normal C&nbsp;API.  There did not
seem to be a lot of support for this idea from the group, though.
<p>
If an application uses <tt>mmap()</tt> to map the same page four-billion
times, the map count in the kernel will overflow, with all of the <a
href="/Articles/693038/">undesirable 
effects</a> that come from a reference-count overflow.  Getting to this point
is not easy; one needs a machine with 30GB 
of RAM to be able to do it.  He has posted a fix for the problem; it simply
kills any process that has tried to map the same page more than 5,000
times.  Andrew Morton suggested that the alternative is to just leak the
page.
<p>
There are two ways to get huge pages in user space (hugetlbfs and
transparent huge pages), and they use the page cache differently; Wilcox
would like to unify them.  Hugetlbfs
indexes pages in multiples of 2MB, while transparent huge pages use a
normal 4KB offset.  He would like to make hugetlbfs less special by using
4KB offsets there too.  The only problem is a big performance hit, since
there are many more entries in the radix tree; that makes this approach
unworkable.  So a solution he intends to 
pursue instead is to change the transparent huge pages implementation to use
the multi-size features of his <a href="/Articles/745073/">XArray</a>
mechanism, making it more closely match hugetlbfs.
<p>
Then, he would like to enhance the page cache to allow the use of block
sizes that are bigger than the system page size.  He thinks it can be done
without requiring higher-order allocations, which has been a sticking point
in the past.  In short, the memory-management subsystem would inform the
filesystem when a page fault has occurred and ask the filesystem to take
care of populating the page cache with the needed pages.  The filesystem
can do that with normal 4KB pages; better performance will be had if it
attempts a larger allocation first.
<p>
Dave Chinner pointed out that there were working patches for larger block
sizes in 2007; they used compound pages, and were not accepted due to the
high-order allocation issues.  We have been here before, he said, and know
how it works.  Have high-order allocations been fixed in the meantime?
Wilcox answered that the difference this time around is the fallback path
that is 
implemented within the filesystems.  Chinner worried that this idea didn't
sound reliable; in particular, there could be problems (as usual) with
<tt>truncate()</tt>.  Wilcox answered that much of the work could be done
once in the virtual filesystem layer and, hopefully, made to work reliably.
<p>
He also briefly mentioned the idea of teaching the page cache about holes
(ranges with no blocks allocated) in files.  Currently those are
represented by zero-filled pages in the cache if need be.  Replacing those
with "zero entries" could save a significant amount of memory; an actual
page would only need to be allocated in the event of a write operation.
<p>
There was also a brief discussion of "PFN entries" in the page cache.
Currently, page-cache entries include a pointer to the <tt>page</tt>
structure representing the page in memory.  That structure will point to a
specific mapping (such as the file containing the page).  If you want to
share pages in memory that are shared on disk (in a couple reflinked files,
for example), the same page will have different mappings depending on where
it came from.  In that case, putting that pointer in the cache is going to
lead to trouble, so he proposes using the page-frame number instead.  There
would still be <tt>page</tt> structures backing the whole thing up, but
there would be an extra level of indirection to access them.
<p>
Finally, he said that he would like to get rid of the <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt>
allocation flag, which tells the system that it cannot call into filesystem
code to free memory.  Instead, "scoped allocation", which simply tracks
when filesystem code is holding a lock (and thus cannot be called back
into) should be used.  XFS is the closest to having implemented scoped
allocation, he said, but there are still places where <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> is
used.  This work is not currently making good progress.
<p>
Ts'o said that some good documentation would help; he has been trying to
push this work forward, but has run into some questions.  Chinner warned
that this work has to be done carefully; <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> is often used to
silence the lockdep checker rather than out of a real need to avoid
filesystem calls.  He suggested adding a <tt>GFP_NOLOCKDEP</tt> flag for
that purpose.  Meanwhile, these call sites are hard to identify, since they
are almost never documented as such.
<p>
The plenary session came to an end at this point, but Wilcox had not yet
run out of ideas to run by the development community.
<p>
<h4>Cleaning up struct page</h4>
<p>
The <a href="/Articles/565097/"><tt>page</tt> structure</a> is one of the
most complicated in the kernel; the curious are encouraged to have a look
at <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L29">its
definition</a>.  Each <tt>page</tt> structure tracks one page of physical
memory; it is used differently depending on how the page itself is used.
As a result of varying needs and of the need to keep the structure small

<a href="/Articles/753087/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2018/lsfmm/MatthewWilcoxPage-sm.jpg" alt="[Matthew Wilcox]"
title="Matthew Wilcox" class="lthumb"></a>


(current systems have millions of them), <tt>struct page</tt> has become a
difficult-to-follow mixture of structures, unions, and <tt>#ifdefs</tt>.
Few developers dare to try to make changes there.
<p>
Wilcox posted <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvCszs_7FXrjei9_mtFiKV6nW1FLnYyvPvW-qNZhdog/edit#gid=1377749841">a
set of diagrams</a> showing how the various fields of <tt>struct page</tt>
are used now.  When a kernel subsystem allocates a page, he said, it also
gets access to the <tt>page</tt> structure to keep track of it.  But that
access is not exclusive.  The <tt>refcount</tt> field can go up and down at
any time, even if the allocating subsystem thinks it has exclusive access
to the page.  If the page is mapped into user space, the <tt>mapping</tt>
field will be use for reverse-mapping.  Various flags have special
meanings, and so on.
<p>
In the end, a lot of users simply don't bother trying to store information
in <tt>struct page</tt> even though there is space available there; it
simply looks too complicated, and it is not at all clear which fields are
safe to modify.  That is, he said, "a shame".
<p>
To make kernel development less shameful, he is proposing a reorganization
of the <tt>page</tt> structure to make it more comprehensible.  The fields
that are safe to touch have been moved together, resulting in five
contiguous words of available memory.  The complex arrangement of structs
and unions has been replaced with a single set of unions, each containing a
set of structs or simple types.
<p>
There was some discussion about the details of specific fields, and it was
established that drivers could safely use the <tt>mem_cgroup</tt> field.
In general, though, everybody seemed to feel that the proposal was a major
improvement that made <tt>struct page</tt> much easier to understand.
Wilcox promised that a patch set making these changes would be forthcoming
soon.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I made a few cleanups to struct page last cycle, so it used to be worse ;-)<br>

<p>
I didn't know where I was going at the time; it wasn't until I cleaned up some bits that I could see how to clean up other bits.<br>

Anyway, the patches to rearrange struct page into the later version are now posted:<br>

Am I stupid for not understanding your diagram? :-) I don't understand what the horizontal and vertical axes are. It sort of looks like horizontal counts bits (because the first few things are the page flags, right?), except it possibly can't. Are the things along the horizontal axes perhaps different uses (ie., a union)? Why are they numbered, then?<br>

It helps to be in the room when I'm explaining the diagram :-)<br>
<p>
For the first three tabs, each row represents four bytes.  The first row (or two rows for the 64-bit struct page) are 'flags', and each cell represents one bit with a two-letter abbreviation of the name of the flag.<br>
Then there's a row of headers which enumerate some of the users of struct page (page cache, anon, slab, slub, page tables, etc)<br>
At this point the meaning of each cell changes; one cell represents one byte.<br>
The dark lines represent boundaries within the struct page, eg we currently have:<br>
<p>
struct page {<br>
    union {<br>
        struct address_space *mapping;<br>
        /* deferred_list.head */<br>
    };<br>
    union {<br>
        unsigned long index;<br>
        /* deferred_list.tail */<br>
    };<br>
...<br>
};<br>
<p>
so there's a dark line between mapping and index to show that we can't just put a list_head into the union.<br>
<p>
Fields which have the same meaning between all page types are shown without vertical lines (eg refcount) while fields which happen to be used for the same meaning between different page types are shown with vertical lines.<br>
<p>
Hope that's helpful.  Yes, it's a confusing diagram.  I spent hours trying to come up with a good graphical representation of what's going on in struct page, and this was the best I could do.<br>

Maybe you should add an extra blank line after the flags, to point out that the numbering no longer matters there?<br>
<p>
Also, I wonder, why are people all “WE ARE OUT OF PAGE FLAGS” all the time, when there are clearly tons of them left for 64-bit and a bunch even for 32-bit?<br>

I've added the blank line as requested.  I think that improves things for people following along at home, but I'm not sure it would have fit on the projector's screen :-)<br>
<p>
My slot wasn't focused on the flags, so I didn't fill in all the rest of the details; I juts handwaved at it because everybody else in the room knew what other things were in those bits.  I've filled in the fields that are commonly stored in those bits; the problem is that they're all dependent on various CONFIG options and I haven't taken the trouble to figure out likely values in order to size the fields to realistic number of bits.  If you can make sense of page-flags-layout.h and the rest of the generating machinery, please let me know.  The first problem you'll face is that whoever did the ASCII art in those files was a fan of big-endian bit numbering (probably from IBM).<br>

What color should the bike shed be? <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding</a><br>
<p>
Normally, phrases that reference bikeshedding are used to point out that a discussion has gotten off track, and is likely time to move on. Other common use is to point out that even if important, it may not be the best use of the current time. <br>
<p>
(Example here IMO, is that physical face-to-face meetings are few and far between for many of the Kernel, and if anything can be done later on the mailing list, do so and use the remaining time for other things that are best done in-person.)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; it simply kills any process that has tried to map the same page more than 5,000 times</font><br>
<p>
Does that potentially interact with KSM, or VMs that merge identical pages in other ways? It seems plausible for a process to have 5000 identical pages (e.g. 20MB of zeroes), and something might want to merge them into a single physical page to save RAM.<br>

The writeup for this part wasn't exactly what I intended to say ;-)<br>
<p>
What the patch does is keep a list of processes with more than 5000 mappings. That's no process on my laptop, but some workloads will have a process or two end up on this list. I understand ElectricFence creates a lot of mappings and so does UML.<br>
<p>
Once any individual page goes over 2 billion mappings, we check the list. Anyone on the list with this page mapped more than 1000 times is deemed to be part of the attack and is killed.<br>
<p>

<p>
Thanks for mentioning the KSM possibility. I hadn't thought of that. I'll take a look at the KSM code to see if it tries to avoid mapcount overflow. I think the zero page is treated specially, but it's not unreasonable to check for other special patterns.<br>

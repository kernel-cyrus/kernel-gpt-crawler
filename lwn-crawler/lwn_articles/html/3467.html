The second day of the Linux Kernel Developers Summit was held on
June&nbsp;25 in Ottawa.  This writeup covers the discussions from that day;
see also <a href="/Articles/3327/">our Day One coverage</a>.

<p>
<h2>Databases</h2>

IBM's Ken Rozendal gave a presentation on what large database systems need
from Linux for optimal performance.  For the most part, it was a familiar
shopping list: large pages, large block I/O operations, asynchronous I/O,
direct I/O, multiqueue scheduler, reduced lock contention, etc.  Much of
that list has already found its way into the 2.5 development series, so the
database people should be reasonably happy.  Now it's mostly a matter of
waiting for the 2.6 stable release.
<p>
One interesting point Ken raised had to do with NUMA systems.  According to
Ken, most large (8-way or greater) SMP systems are really NUMA systems
internally - it's just that the vendors do not present them that way.  It
is hard to make a multi-way system without making memory (and other
resources) be "closer" to some processors than others.  So various
techniques for improving performance on NUMA systems (process CPU affinity,
local memory allocation, text replication) will be increasingly important,
even on systems which are not advertised as being NUMA.
<p>
Linus pointed out that even desktop PCs are starting to look more NUMA-like
as a result of processors with hyperthreading.
<p>
One desired feature still does not exist in Linux: I/O completion ports.
Completion ports allow a process to wait on a (potentially very large)
number of I/O events, and provide a straightforward indication of which
event actually occurred.  Applications like the Domino server, which can be
waiting on tens of thousands of network sockets, would benefit from this
capability. 
<p>
As always, there remains work to do.  A comparison of this presentation
with the database wishlist from <a
href="http://old.lwn.net/2001/features/KernelSummit/">last year's kernel summit</a>
shows, however, that a great deal of progress has been made.


<h2>HP's kernel wishlist</h2>

Bdale Garbee, the current Debian Project Leader, presented HP's wishlist
for the Linux kernel.  It was relatively short and straightforward; either
HP is mostly happy with the state of the kernel, or the company hasn't
gotten around to asking for the big ticket items yet.
<p>
For example, many of HP's requests had to do with the SCSI layer, but they
didn't ask for the massive rewrite that most kernel hackers seem to think
is needed.  HP would like to see support for the SCSI&nbsp;3 REPORT LUN
operation, very large numbers of SCSI logical units, better error handling,
and failover support.
<p>
Like many vendors, HP would like better support for very large systems.  In
particular, the company sells systems with more than 256 PCI busses
installed, and would like that to work well (the support is mostly there
now).  Better support for discontiguous memory is also on HP's list; some
of HP's chipsets impose specific memory layout requirements.
<p>
HP, too, is getting into the "carrier grade Linux" area; it seems there are
real customers wanting to spend real money on that stuff.
<p>
Improved hotplug support made the list.  HP would like to see PCMCIA
devices treated like other hotpluggable devices; that would make iPAQ
support easier.  Better IDE hotplug support also made the list.
The iPAQ folks would also like union filesystem support.
<p>
Finally, a couple of customer support issues made the list.  Customers
really don't like it when their devices change names, so the old standby -
table device naming - was mentioned.  Bdale also mentioned support of
binary modules, which is "pure hell."  As Debian project leader he's not
much fond of binary modules, but HP has to deal with them.  Some discussion
of how to better support vendors and external modules ensued, but the
problem is thorny and no real solutions emerged.
<p>
In the last part of the talk, Bdale whipped out his Debian T-shirt and
raised the question: does Debian violate its Social Contract by shipping
the Linux kernel?  The issue, of course, is the inclusion of proprietary
firmware in a number of device drivers.  Kernel developers, as a whole,
seem unconcerned about proprietary firmware.  There can be
specific problematic cases (i.e. where binary-only firmware is marked as
being licensed under the GPL), but most firmware is seen as being OK.  Greg
Kroah-Hartman pointed out that he is willing to move firmware into a
user-space task for USB devices, but that nobody has been sufficiently
concerned to make a patch to do this.
<p>
Linus stated that moving firmware into user space is "technically
incredibly stupid" and "a sign of mental disorder."  Nobody really
challenged that claim.
<p>
In the end, this question was pushed back to the Debian legal community,
which seems to have more time to debate such issues.  Just when is it
permissible to have proprietary firmware for a device mixed in with GPL
code?  We look forward to their answer.


<h2>The Loadable Security Module</h2>

Chris Wright presented the Loadable Security Module patch.  This patch has
its roots in the previous kernel summit, where Linus asked for a standard
mechanism by which enhanced security regimes could be loaded into the
kernel.  The LSM patch places about 150 hooks throughout the kernel; each
hook, essentially, provides a security module with the opportunity to veto
an action by some process.  
<p>
The LSM interface has been stable for about six months, and a number of
security mechanisms have been implemented on top of it.  Chris stopped
short of saying that it is ready for merging into the kernel, but he did
say it's at a point where it needs wider exposure and feedback.
<p>
Nobody expressed outright opposition to the LSM patch, which is a good sign
for its eventual inclusion.  The questions were mostly oriented around
performance penalties, code maintainability, and other approaches to
security.
<p>
In general, the performance cost of the LSM patch is small - 0-2% on
lmbench runs.  That cost is, of course, not counting the overhead imposed
by any particular security regime - it is just the LSM framework itself.
So, as a whole, LSM costs little; the big exception is with
high-performance networking.  Gigabyte Ethernet can suffer by as much as
20%.  So there is interest in being able to disable the LSM calls for
low-level networking only.  (<b>Update</b>: the 20% performance cost, it
seems, is an SELinux issue, and is not caused by the LSM framework itself.
I'm told the real LSM penalty is closer to 5% - still significant, but not
on the same scale.)
<p>
The LSM patch is intrusive by its nature - those 150 hooks have to be
spread throughout the kernel.  The changes are small, however; they consist
mostly of a call into the security module and a possible error exit.  There
was some exploration of possibly less intrusive ways of hooking in security
checks: checking at the system call boundary or using <tt>ptrace()</tt>.
But checking in this way is far less efficient, and it is also subject to
race conditions that could be used to undermine the security of the
system.  
<p>
The LSM team went away without a great deal of feedback beyond a need to
look at the worst of the performance problems.  Chances are that LSM will
make an appearance sometime in 2.5.


<h2>Asynchronous I/O</h2>

Ben LaHaise led a session on asynchronous I/O; he was mostly looking for
feedback on how he should proceed with the AIO patch to get it to where it
could be merged into the mainline kernel.  He got what he was after.
<p>
Ben started with a quick status update.  Some small pieces of the AIO
functionality have been merged recently, including the function callbacks
on wait queues.  Most of the code, however, remains outside the tree: the
AIO syscalls, the "work todos" functionality, kvecs, the generic file
read/write code, and the driver changes.  Not all of that code is ready for
merging; the system calls work well, but the kvecs are controversial and
the "work todos" need work still.  There is a fair amount of boilerplate
and duplicated code associated with AIO support; that needs to be trimmed
down. 
<p>
The real question that Ben had was: to what extent should AIO support be
worked into the kernel?  A complete AIO implementation would affect almost
all parts of the kernel and would break a lot of things.  A related
question was the form that AIO support should take.  The current patch sets
up a new set of file operations for AIO, which is handled as an operation
that is distinct from regular, synchronous I/O.  An alternative would be
to make <i>all</i> I/O within the kernel be asynchronous; then synchronous
semantics could be implemented with an explicit wait in the relevant system
calls.
<p>
The answer from Linus seems to be to go for it: all I/O within the kernel
should be asynchronous.  Kernel interfaces should, in general, be
asynchronous, and having two separate interfaces to do the same thing is
not a good idea.  Thus, Ben should go ahead and implement fully
asynchronous I/O, and if that change breaks a lot of drivers for a while so
be it.  The drivers that matter to people will get fixed, sooner or later.
<p>
The discussion wandered into a number of implementation details that are
not necessarily of interest here.  One that is worth pointing out is the
matter of "kvecs."  The kvec is Ben's lighter-weight answer to the
"kiovec;" it is a way of representing an I/O operation at the lowest level,
with pointers directly to the physical pages involved.  The kernel
currently has several data structures with this same basic task: kvecs,
kiovecs, and the bio structure used in the block layer.  It was agreed that
unifying these structures would be a good idea.
<p>
The path ahead looks fairly clear, and it should lead to a much more
capable and coherent I/O subsystem.  It will also be disruptive, however;
expect a lot of things to break between here and the feature freeze.  Of
course, that is what development kernels are for.



<h2>SCSI</h2>

James Bottomley led a session on the status of the SCSI layer, and what
needs to be done with it.  Criticizing the SCSI code is a common kernel
developer passtime, of course, so there was great interest in hearing what
was to be done to fix it up.
<p>
James started by posing the question: is the SCSI layer <i>really</i> as
bad as people make it out to be?  His position is that, in fact, the SCSI
layer is in better shape than most people think.  The worst part is the
error handler; it needs to be torn out and redone.  Beyond that, there is a
certain amount of cruft in the rest of the code (though not as much as
there used to be), but as a whole it works as it should.
<p>
Much of what is now seen as cruft was once necessary - it implemented
support features that were not, at the time, available in the kernel.  As
the kernel matures, generic kernel code can replace things that were
previously done at the SCSI level.  The most recent example of this process
is tagged command queueing, which is currently implemented in the low-level
SCSI adapter drivers.  Now that the block layer understands TCQ, this code
can (eventually) be taken out of the SCSI layer.
<p>
The real plan, though, as solidified in this session, is to eliminate most
or all of the SCSI "midlayer" altogether.  The midlayer sits between the
kernel, the high-level SCSI drivers (i.e. the disk and tape drivers), and
the low-level (adapter) drivers.  Increasingly the tasks it handles are
being merged into the block code, and the midlayer should shrivel away.
<p>
Quite a bit of work will be required before this task is complete, however;
there are a number of things that the SCSI midlayer does that will have to
be worked into the block layer.  James also does not want to rush into a
major thrashup of this code; as he put it, SCSI is "Linux's key to the
enterprise" and it absolutely has to work well.  He said, to general
applause, that SCSI changes need to be well tested before merging into the
kernel, unlike the development model used in that other low-level disk
subsystem. 
<p>
Various other issues were discussed.  Handling of multipath devices is an
open problem; it's not clear whether the multipath handling should be done
at a very low level (in the adaptor driver), a very high level (in the
block layer), or somewhere in between.  The SCSI code should perform "lazy
allocation," where it does not allocate data structures for (or even spin
up) drives until it knows that they will be used.  Storage-area networks
can present thousands of drives, most of which will never be accessed by
any given system.  The current scheme of setting up for every drive was
compared to the networking system creating data structures for every other
system it finds on the net.
<p>
How much work will be done in the 2.5 series remains unclear.  In the end,
though, the SCSI layer is likely to look a lot smaller and lighter than it
does now.


<h2>Kernel release management</h2>

The final session of the day had to do with release management, and how to
make the 2.6 stable release work better than 2.4 did.  Ted Ts'o started out
by stating that the usual "out of the blue" feature freezes tend to be self
defeating.  As soon as the freeze is decreed, Linus gets buried under a big
pile of patches.  Even if the kernel was relatively stable before all those
patches show up, it isn't afterwards.  A better way, said Ted, would be to
establish a set of features for 2.6 and a well-known freeze date.  That
should prevent the "thundering herd of patches" problem.
<p>
The question came up of whether there should be a "backport" version of the
2.4 kernel with some of the 2.5 features - things like the O(1) scheduler,
for example.  It was also suggested that perhaps the 2.6 kernel could be
stabilized and released <i>before</i> some of the remaining big changes -
such as reverse mapping VM and asynchronous I/O - go in.  Neither of these
ideas was greated with great enthusiasm.  Marcelo, the 2.4 maintainer,
stated that he would rather see vendors handle backporting and packaging of
2.5 features themselves
if they feel the need to do so.  And a stable series without
the other pending important changes did not seem interesting.
<p>
Should perhaps the 2.7 development series open at the same time as the 2.6
release happens, or shortly thereafter?  A new development kernel would
certainly relieve some of the pressure that tends to push late changes into
a "feature frozen" kernel.  Linus worries, though, that a new development
kernel would distract too many developers, and the bugs in the stable
kernel simply would not get fixed.
<p>
Then the idea came up that the maintainer of the next stable series should
be named during the feature freeze stage, and should take over the stable
releases from the beginning.  That person would work with Linus to
determine which patches should go in before the stable release.  The idea
is that whoever will be dealing with problems in the stable kernel would be
well motivated to keep disruptive changes out.  This idea was well
received, even by Linus, and looks likely to happen.
<p>
That, of course, begs the question of just who would be the next stable
series maintainer.  Volunteers were notably scarce in the room; some
developers were seen hiding under the tables when the question was
raised.  The general sympathy was toward drafting either Andrew Morton or
Dave Jones for the job.  Neither stated that he would do it, however.
<p>
Finally, it came down to deciding what would go into 2.6, and when the
feature freeze would happen.  Linus was not interested in establishing a
feature list; he would rather see what comes up.  He did go for a date,
though: the 2.5 feature freeze is scheduled for next Halloween,
October&nbsp;31, 2002.  That should make for interesting names: shall this
be the "greased ghost" release?  Or just "trick or treat"?
<p>
There was a fair amount of optimism at the end of this session; chances
seem good that the release process will go better this time around.  Of
course, there is still a lot of time for things to go wrong between now and
then...

      FWIW, "I/O Completion Ports" are just a way of getting
completion notification from asynchronous I/O requests.
Once the kernel supports AIO, it will probably also
support completion ports.  Whether it will support
exactly the I/O Completion Ports windows programmers
are familiar with is another question; the scheduling
policy associated with Windows IOCP's may be protected
by a Microsoft patent.

      Making an annotated photo, like last year's, is high on my list.  I'll not be able to do it, though, until I'm back home and in front of a good, high-resolution screen - my ancient, windup laptop just isn't up to that sort of gimp work.  So, next week at best.  Sorry...

      The 20% figure mentioned in the story refers to testing that was done with<br>SELinux loaded on top of LSM .  The overhead for LSM itself is in the<br>5-7% range.  Note that this is for gigabit ethernet; there is no noticable<br>performance hit with 100Mbps networking.

      I haven't heard anything about the high-resolution posix timer<br>patch going into 2.5.  Surely that's going to be one of the<br>features that goes in before the freeze...

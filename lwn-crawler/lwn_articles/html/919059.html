<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>January 4, 2023</br>
           </div>
<p>
The Linux security module (LSM) subsystem has long had limitations on
which modules could be combined in a given running kernel.  Some parts of
the problem have been solved over the years—"smaller" LSMs can be combined
at will with a single, more complex LSM—but combining (or "stacking")
SELinux with, say, Smack or AppArmor has never been possible.  Back in
October, we <a href="/Articles/912775/">looked</a> at the most recent
attempt to add that ability, which resulted in patches to add two new system
calls for LSM.  By the end of December, the number of new system calls had
risen to three.
</p>

<p>
The underlying problem that Casey Schaufler is trying to solve is the
handling of 
the multiple security contexts and how to report them to user space; that
is one of the barriers to stacking two or more context-using LSMs.  These
contexts  
are a string representation of the information used by an LSM to make its
access-control decisions.  Schaufler's efforts to fully solve the
LSM-stacking problem have now stretched over the last ten years.
</p>

<p>
His original
plan for reporting the contexts was to simply have multiple null-terminated
entries in the relevant 
<tt>/proc</tt> file for each attribute when there were multiple
context-using LSMs active in 
the system.  Multi-LSM-aware applications could be modified to read past
the first null to see if there was additional context information.
But in September, 
new LSM maintainer Paul Moore looked at the patches again with an eye
toward merging them.  That API, which even Schaufler was not particularly
happy with, was not one that Moore was willing to add. He <a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/CAHC9VhTDGwO789t59EyOV0SwnwGrdyBhRiuJpoY7cB4MSe02BQ@mail.gmail.com/">suggested</a>
that the time had come to add some LSM-specific system calls to make that
information available.
</p>

<p>
After some grumbling, Schaufler came up with some patches along the lines
of what Moore had suggested.
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221025184519.13231-1-casey@schaufler-ca.com/">Version
1 of the patch set</a> added <tt>lsm_self_attr()</tt> for retrieving
attributes for the current process and <tt>lsm_module_list()</tt> to list
the active LSMs in the system.  In <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221229233454.43880-1-casey@schaufler-ca.com/">version&nbsp;4</a>,
which was posted December&nbsp;29, <tt>lsm_self_attr()</tt> had become
<tt>lsm_get_self_attr()</tt>; the patch set added
<tt>lsm_set_self_attr()</tt>, which will 
allow setting security attributes for the current process.  
</p>

<p>
The
comments on this round are scant—non-existent as of this writing—which may
reflect a lack of attention during the holiday season or that the code is
close to ready to merge.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221123201552.7865-1-casey%40schaufler-ca.com/">previous
version</a> of the patch set also added the three calls and was not
particularly contentious when it was posted toward the end of November.
That might suggest the latter interpretation.
</p>

<p>
Other than the addition of an interface to set the security attributes,
there are not a lot of changes from the original proposal.   The "reserved
IDs" for LSMs has remained, though there have been multiple objections to
them along the way.  Essentially, all of the uses of the integer LSM IDs
(to identify a specific LSM) start at&nbsp;100 (<tt>LSM_ID_CAPABILITY</tt>
for the capability LSM) and every positive integer below that is reserved
for future use. Moore was <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHC9VhR9h1GF6VGovp1+UB-vt+QNofjmecPwLqE3OviKQHRMcg@mail.gmail.com/">adamant</a>
that a pool of reserved IDs remain; this round of the patch set has a
comment in <tt>lsm.h</tt> that explains how those might be used:
<blockquote class="bq">
The LSM infrastructure itself has no variable state,
but that may change. One proposal would allow loadable modules, in which
case an attribute such as LSM_IS_LOADABLE might identify the dynamic
modules. Another potential attribute could be which security [module] is
associated with network labeling using netlabel. Another possible attribute
could be related to stacking behavior in a namespaced environment.
While it would be possible to intermingle the LSM infrastructure attribute
values with the security module provided values, keeping them separate
provides a clearer distinction.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Looking at the most recent patches,
the LSM listing function looks much as it did before:
<pre>
    int lsm_module_list(unsigned int *ids, size_t *size, unsigned long flags);
</pre>

<p>
In <tt>ids</tt>, it returns an array of LSM IDs for
the active 
LSMs in the system in the order they were added, as long as there
are sufficient entries in <tt>size</tt>.  <tt>flags</tt> is reserved for
future uses and must be zero.  The return value is the number of IDs
returned or a negative error code.
</p>

<p>
Likewise,
<tt>lsm_get_self_attr()</tt> picks up from what the call that it replaced
(<tt>lsm_self_attr()</tt>) did: fill in an array of
<tt>struct&nbsp;lsm_ctx</tt> entries with all of the attributes that apply
to the current process for all of the active LSMs.  That structure looks
much the same as it did before:
<pre>
    struct lsm_ctx {
	    __u32		id;
	    __u64		flags;
	    __kernel_size_t	ctx_len;
	    __u8		ctx[];
    };
</pre>
The <tt>id</tt> holds the LSM ID and <tt>flags</tt> is unused as yet;
<tt>ctx_len</tt> is the size of the <tt>ctx</tt> array that holds the
value.
<tt>ctx_len</tt> is at least
<tt>strlen(ctx)+1</tt> in size since <tt>ctx</tt> is always
null-terminated.  The 
description of the returned array of <tt>lsm_ctx</tt> values can be found
in the <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221229233454.43880-5-casey@schaufler-ca.com/">patch
that adds <tt>lsm_get_self_attr()</tt></a>. 
</p>

<p>
The attributes that are currently defined are described in the
documentation file (<tt>userspace-api/lsm.rst</tt>) that appears near the top
of the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221229233454.43880-2-casey@schaufler-ca.com/">first
patch</a>.  They consist of a half-dozen types of attributes that are currently
available in <tt>/proc</tt> files, such as <tt>LSM_ATTR_CURRENT</tt>, which
is the active security context for the process
(i.e. <tt>/proc/attr/current</tt>).  That attribute is the only one that is
shared between all three of the context-using LSMs (SELinux, Smack, and
AppArmor). Two of the other attributes (<tt>LSM_ATTR_EXEC</tt> for the
context when 
the process was executed and <tt>LSM_ATTR_PREV</tt> for the previous
security context, if any) are shared between SELinux and AppArmor.  The
others currently only pertain to SELinux.  The "Files and directories"
section of the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html">proc man page</a>
has some more information on the attributes and how they are used.
</p>

<p>
The call looks basically the same as its predecessor:
<pre>
    int lsm_get_self_attr(struct lsm_ctx *ctx, size_t *size, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
It will return the array in <tt>ctx</tt>, with <tt>size</tt> updated to the
returned length.  The previous version required <tt>flags</tt> to be zero,
but now it can
be used to restrict which of the attributes are returned by setting
individual bits for each of the attributes of interest.
</p>

<p>
The counterpart to that is the new <tt>lsm_set_self_attr()</tt>:
<pre>
    int lsm_set_self_attr(struct lsm_ctx *ctx, size_t size, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
It takes a pointer to a single <tt>lsm_ctx</tt> (of the given
<tt>size</tt>) and tries to set the value of the (single) attribute
identified in 
<tt>flags</tt>. The function calls into the LSM code to set the value,
which allows the security modules to decide whether to allow the operation
or not. The function returns 
zero on success or a negative error code if it fails.
</p>

<p>
Since it was initially posted, a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221229233454.43880-9-casey@schaufler-ca.com/">set
of kernel self-tests</a> for the system calls have been added to the patch
set.  There were few real complaints about the previous version, so one
might just conclude that these system calls are about ready to merge, which
would be a significant step toward Schaufler's longtime goal.  Perhaps
before the end of&nbsp;2023, we will see the quest for this phase of LSM
stacking come to 
a close.  Next up would be completing the  handling the networking side of
the stacking 
problem, which will lead to the "<a
href="/ml/linux-security-module/7d0feee1-a9e6-ac82-6962-89b17af025eb@schaufler-ca.com/">universal
stacking</a>" nirvana that Schaufler has been seeking—lo these many years.

<p>
There's no affordance for `lsm_module_list(NULL, NULL, 0);` returning the number of LSMs to ensure that all are returned (though with loadable LSMs, this is TOCTOU…)? Or is `lsm_module_list(NULL, &amp;sz, 0);` the way to do this? Same with `lsm_get_self_attr` for that matter.<br>
<p>

What is the syscall going to do with write access to `size`?<br>

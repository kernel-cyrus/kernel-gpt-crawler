           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 11, 2019</br>
           </div>
Interfaces for the reporting of events to user space from the kernel have
been a recurring topic on the kernel mailing lists for almost as long as
the kernel has existed; LWN <a href="/Articles/95347/">covered one</a> 15
years ago, for example.  Numerous special-purpose event-reporting APIs
exist, but there are none that are designed to be a single place to
obtain any type of event.  David Howells is the latest to attempt to change
that situation with <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/155991702981.15579.6007568669839441045.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">a
new notification interface</a> that, naturally, uses a ring buffer to
transfer events to user space without the need to make system calls.  The
API itself (which hasn't changed greatly since it was <a
href="/Articles/760714/">posted in 2018</a>)  is not hugely controversial,
but the associated security model has inspired a few heated discussions.
<p>
<h4><tt>/dev/watch_queue</tt></h4>
<p>
Howells's mechanism is implemented as a special device, likely to be called
<tt>/dev/watch_queue</tt>.  Applications start by opening that device for
write access; they then need to configure the size of the ring buffer.
That is done with the <tt>IOC_WATCH_QUEUE_SET_SIZE</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt>
command, passing the desired size in pages.  In the current patch set, the
size must be a power of two and no greater than&nbsp;16.  Once that is
done, <tt>mmap()</tt> is used to map the ring buffer into the application's
address space.
<p>
The ring buffer itself is divided into eight-byte slots.  Entries for
specific events can occupy more than one slot; the first slot always
contains this structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct watch_notification {
	__u32	type:24;
	__u32	subtype:8;
	__u32	info;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>type</tt> and <tt>subtype</tt> fields tell the application what
type of event has occurred; the attachment of a USB device would be
reported as <tt>WATCH_TYPE_USB_NOTIFY</tt> and
<tt>NOTIFY_USB_DEVICE_ADD</tt>.  The special <tt>WATCH_TYPE_META</tt> type
and <tt>WATCH_META_SKIP_NOTIFICATION</tt> subtype indicate an entry that
should simply be skipped (there are a couple of uses for such entries that
will be described below).  The <tt>info</tt> field contains flags to report
ring overruns or events dropped due to a lack of memory, for example; it
also contains a subfield describing the number of slots occupied by this
particular event.
<p>
The ring buffer itself looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    struct watch_queue_buffer {
	union {
	    struct {
		struct watch_notification watch; /* WATCH_TYPE_META */
		__u32		head;		/* Ring head index */
		__u32		tail;		/* Ring tail index */
		__u32		mask;		/* Ring index mask */
	    } meta;
	    struct watch_notification slots[0];
	};
    };
</pre>
<p>
The use of a union implies that the <tt>meta</tt> structure, containing the
<tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt> pointers for the ring, overlays the first
three slots.  The special <tt>watch</tt> structure embedded in there is
marked to be skipped, so user-space code will simply pass over the header
information without the need to do anything special.
<p>
The buffer is empty if <tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt> are equal.  The
kernel will insert the next event at the slot pointed to by <tt>head</tt>
and increment <tt>head</tt> by the number of slots used by that event.
Events will not be split at the end of the ring; if there are not enough
slots left to hold the full event, the ring will be padded with skip events
and the new event inserted at the beginning.  User space should consume events
starting at <tt>tail</tt>, and increment <tt>tail</tt> accordingly when
each event is dealt with.  As is always the case for data structures like
this, appropriate memory barriers should be used when working with the ring
indexes.
<p>
The application can call <tt>poll()</tt> to wait for events if need be.
<p>
<h4>Selecting events</h4>
<p>
The other piece of the puzzle is telling the kernel which events are of
interest to begin with.  Each subsystem provides its own way of requesting that
events be delivered into a specific buffer.  The patch set implements a number
of event sources:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Events involving keys can be requested with the
     <tt>KEYCTL_WATCH_KEY</tt> command to the <a
     href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/keyctl.2.html"><tt>keyctl()</tt></a>
     system call.
<li> Filesystem mount and unmount events can be had with a call to the new
     <tt>watch_mount()</tt> system call.
<li> Events on specific filesystems (deemed "superblock events") are
     requested with the new <tt>watch_sb()</tt> system call.
<li> Yet another new system call, <tt>watch_devices()</tt>, allows for the
     requesting of events related to hardware.  The patch set adds support
     for events from the block and USB subsystems.
</ul>
<p>

Finally, by default all events of the requested type(s) will be delivered into
the ring buffer.  The application might well only be interested in a small
subset of those events.  To avoid passing data that is not useful, there is
a filtering mechanism built around this structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct watch_notification_type_filter {
	__u32	type;
	__u32	info_filter;
	__u32	info_mask;
	__u32	subtype_filter[8];
    };
</pre>
<p>
The application puts the type of the event of interest into <tt>type</tt>.
<tt>subtype_filter</tt> is a bitmask that can be used to limit which event
subtypes are delivered; the application sets the bit corresponding to each
desired subtype.  For more complex filtering, the
<tt>info_filter</tt> and <tt>info_mask</tt> fields can be used.  Any given
event will be delivered if:
<p>
<pre>
    (event.info &amp; info_mask) == info_filter
</pre>
<p>
In other words, <tt>info_mask</tt> indicates which parts of the
<tt>info_field</tt> are of interest, and <tt>info_filter</tt> holds the values
that should be found in those parts.
<p>
The application can package up as many filters as it needs into this
structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct watch_notification_filter {
	__u32	nr_filters;
	__u32	__reserved;
	struct watch_notification_type_filter filters[];
    };
</pre>
<p>
The result is then passed to the kernel with the
<tt>IOC_WATCH_QUEUE_SET_FILTER</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command.
<p>
A lot more details about the notification mechanism, including the
kernel-side API, can be found in the document at the beginning of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/155991709157.15579.17714751502536525102.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">this
patch</a>.
<p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
Naturally, information out of the kernel could be sensitive and should not
be given to any process that might request it.  In <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/155905930702.7587.7100265859075976147.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/">an
earlier (May&nbsp;28)
version</a> of the patch set,
events related to keys would only be delivered if the recipient has "View"
access to the key involved.  Information on mount events was unrestricted;
superblock events were also unrestricted for any filesystem that was
actually visible to the calling process.  Generic device events were not a
part of that patch set; block-subsystem events were supported as a distinct
type and were
unrestricted.  This policy was seen as being overly loose in a number of
ways, one of which was surprising to many of the participants in the
discussion.
<p>
Consider mount events in particular, and whether process B should be able
to see events generated when process&nbsp;A mounts or unmounts a
filesystem.  One might argue that B should be privileged, or should at
least have enough access to watch what A is doing in general.  Casey
Schaufler, though, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/50c2ea19-6ae8-1f42-97ef-ba5c95e40475@schaufler-ca.com/">argued
the reverse</a>: for B to see an event generated by A, it is A that should
have sufficient privilege to send signals to B:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	If process A sends a signal (writes information) to process B the
	kernel checks that either process A has the same UID as process B
	or that process A has privilege to override that policy.  Process B
	is passive in this access control decision, while process A is
	active. In the event delivery case, process A does something
	(e.g. modifies a keyring) that generates an event, which is then
	sent to process B's event buffer. Again, A is active and B is
	passive. Process A must have write access (defined by some policy)
	to process B's event buffer.
</div>
<p>
Any other policy, he said, would <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/058f227c-71ab-a6f4-00bf-b8782b3b2956@schaufler-ca.com/">open
covert channels</a> between the processes and would be difficult to specify
and model in general.  To others, though, this policy seemed backward and
surprising; most others were also less worried about covert channels than
Schaufler is.  The discussion circled around a few versions of the patch
set with no seeming resolution (though Howells did attempt to implement the
policy Schaufler was asking for); at one point Andy Lutomirski <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/176F8189-3BE9-4B8C-A4D5-8915436338FB@amacapital.net/">called
it</a> "<q>a giant design error</q>".
<p>
One seemingly counterintuitive example perhaps led to a better
understanding between the participants, though.  SELinux maintainer Stephen
Smalley <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/c82052e5-ca11-67b5-965e-8f828081f31c@tycho.nsa.gov/">pointed
out</a> that, if two processes are both able to map a file, they can
communicate via that file, so restricting notifications about activity on
that file does not increase security.  Schaufler <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/07e92045-2d80-8573-4d36-643deeaff9ec@schaufler-ca.com/">replied</a>
with an example (<tt>/dev/null</tt>), where this is not the case, saying
that many such examples exist.  Lutomirski then <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CALCETrVuNRPgEzv-XY4M9m6sEsCiRHxPenN_MpcMYc1h26vVwQ@mail.gmail.com/">agreed</a>
that notifications between unrelated processes should not be allowed for a
file like <tt>/dev/null</tt>.  That opens the door for a renewed discussion
on the security policies around notifications.
<p>
This understanding has not, yet, led to a full agreement about what those
policies should be.  It would not be surprising if a
full consensus were to take a while to emerge; this is a complex new API
with new security implications for every subsystem that submits events to
it.  One generally wants to have the security story figured out before
something like this is released in a mainline kernel.  So this work may or
may not find its way into 5.3, but it does appear to have a reasonable
chance of avoiding the fate of many other generalized event-notification
mechanisms and going upstream eventually.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Another reason to be concerned about whether a process has permission to send rather than receive an event is overflow. Unless the sender blocks (which I assume is not the case here because it's really inconvenient), then they can induce an overflow of the recipient's event queue.<br>
<p>
How many applications properly handle the overflow condition with inotify or fanotify?<br>
<p>
Traditional signals (as opposed to real-time signals) don't have this problem because multiple signals coalesce to a fixed set idempotent conditions; the buffer can't overflow even though the sending action is asynchronous. Similarly, BSD kqueue EVFILT_VNODE events (the analog to fanotify in BSD, excluding extensions) can't overflow because they require a listener to hold an open file descriptor to the vnode; each open descriptor provides a unique buffer (a unique channel between sender and recipient) into which events coalesce.<br>
<p>
Ultimately I think any completely general, passive event framework is fundamentally lossy (if not broken). If it's passive, you can't block or throttle the sender. If you can't block or throttle the sender, events must be capable of coalescing into a fixed set of idempotent condition. But such semantics are not general--not in the way people want.<br>
<p>
These are the same dilemmas for event buses, multicasting, etc. There's no avoiding them. It's no coincidence that abstract IPC in Unix settled around signals, which can be sent asynchronously, and files where the sender either blocks or must handle commit failure.<br>

Why are the vast majority of applications where "fetching events via system call" (on a file descriptor) isn't a problem supposed to be held hostage by the tiny majority of applications where this is different *if there are any*?<br>

It's hard to imagine a system where filesystems are mounted and umounted so frequently that passing them to interested applications via read on a file descriptor would be an actual problem. For USB attach/ detach events, the very idea is ludicrous. People don't move this fast. <br>

EMC (static zaps) can also move that fast.  We've just been going through (hard!) work to harden an embedded device so that it's able to pass the latest EMC standard.  (I don't know it's "official" name but we've been using the nickname "4th Edition".)  The HW guys have done their best to divert/filter/etc. this stuff but there are some Catch-22 situations when you have components with antennas that are supposed to pick up RF energy!  In any case, we can see scores of rapidly repeating USB connect/disconnect attempts during static zapping testing.<br>

Yes, hardware connection/disconnection should always include some low-level de-bouncing and include some "detection settling time" to ensure the connection state is steady, before firing events to higher layers. Otherwise nasty things like interrupt storms, queue overflow and state de-synchronization may happen.<br>

Dangit, where's my kdbus/bus1? *looks at watch*<br>
<p>
I don't particularly care for the way dbus does things, but it's ridiculous that there's not a somewhat-sane RPC system that handles this stuff already.<br>

      How come? A new mechanism not using eBPF in any way?

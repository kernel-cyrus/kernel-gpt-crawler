           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>August 5, 2024</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
David Howells wanted to discuss changing the way filesystem code handles
the ability to interrupt or kill operations, in order to fix some
longstanding problems with network 
(and other) filesystems, in a session at
the 2024 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.   As noted in
his <a href="/ml/all/2701318.1706863882%40warthog.procyon.org.uk/">session
proposal</a>, some filesystems may be expecting to not be interruptible,
but are calling code can take locks and mutexes that are interruptible (or
killable), which are effectively
changing the state of the task incorrectly.
He would like to find a solution for that problem.
</p>

<p>
The interruptibility here refers to signal handling.  An interruptible
process will respond to any signals that are not masked or ignored.
Killable is a variant of interruptible that will only respond to fatal
signals.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple places with locks and such 
that could be taken using the <tt>*_interruptible()</tt> and
<tt>*_killable()</tt> variants, but those override the higher-level
non-interruptible setting.
Some kind of mass change is not really
practical to address the problem, Howells said, so it will need to be done
incrementally.
He proposed a
multi-year effort to switch to explicit begin and end functions to bracket
non-interruptible regions, in a way that is
analogous to how hardware interrupts are disabled.  Code could disable
interruptibility, which would be tracked with a counter, then reenable it
when the critical section is finished.
</p>

<p>
For example, an overlayfs filesystem might include a network filesystem as one of its
layers.  The overlayfs might not take interruptible locks, but the network
filesystem might do so, which results in operations that get interrupted in
a way that overlayfs does not expect.  Ted Ts'o thought that a change like
what was described might be useful in some contexts, but did not think
that "it would be something we would want to use all over the place".  The
interruptible status of a particular mutex, for example, is local to the
code that takes it.  Unlike the <a href="/Articles/976355/">effort to switch to <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt></a>,
where the eventual plan is to convert everything to use it, this change
would only be needed for specific calls.
</p>

<p>
Both Kent Overstreet and Dave Chinner asked for more concrete examples of
the problem being solved and how the code would need to change to
accommodate Howells's proposal.  The biggest problem he has encountered,
Howells said, is that <tt>sendmsg()</tt> is interruptible, but that an NFS
filesystem might be mounted as non-interruptible.  "NFS thinks it is not
interruptible, but it is because it is using the network interfaces that
are."
He noted that a conversion would eventually mean that many of the
interruptible (and killable) variants of lock and mutex functions could be
removed. 
</p>

<p>
Chinner and others objected to that, saying that there will still be a need
for those variants.  There were also various objections because many of the
calls to <tt>mutex_lock_interruptible()</tt> are not checked for an error
return, though there were multiple people all talking at once making it
somewhat hard to follow.  Al Viro was also concerned about deadlocks
resulting from the changes proposed.
</p>

<p>
Viro said that handling signals (such as from someone using control-C) is the
responsibility of the caller of the network function; an NFS mount with
<tt>-o&nbsp;hard</tt> does not want or expect its operations to be
interrupted, though, Howells said.  However, calling
<tt>mutex_lock_interruptible()</tt> is only applying the interruptibility
to that specific call, Wedson Almeida Filho and Ts'o said, not to the whole
region between it and the unlock call.  Ts'o said that without a specific
patch changing a particular code path where there is a problem, it will be
difficult for attendees to determine whether it makes sense or not;
meanwhile, he reiterated that he did not see a justification for a
widespread change.
</p>

<p>
Instead of having a call to bracket the regions of non-interruptibility,
Viro asked, why not just disable signals for the region?  But Howells said
that <tt>SIGKILL</tt> cannot be masked, though Christian Brauner pointed
out that the kernel can mask that signal even though user space cannot.
</p>

<p>
Jan Kara agreed with the overall approach, saying that there is a real
problem for callers who do not expect to get interrupted.  But Brauner was
concerned about how someone looking at <tt>sendmsg()</tt>, which is clearly
interruptible, would be able to recognize that in some contexts it can be
called in such a way that it is not interruptible. Howells acknowledged
that could be a problem.
</p>

<p>
Chinner suggested having a variant of <tt>sendmsg()</tt> that is not
interruptible, but Howells said that there are multiple calls like
<tt>sendmsg()</tt> that are affected.  "The documentation of the
uninterruptible state is completely decoupled from where we need to apply
that state", Chinner said.  It would require large comments wherever these
functions are being called, describing how that can happen and what code
paths are affected.  "Otherwise it is unmaintainable." 
</p>

<p>
Viro said that it sounds to him like what Howells wants is to be able to
suspend signal delivery in the network code at times.  The
<tt>TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE</tt> and <tt>TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE</tt> states are
for sleeping processes, Viro continued, which get changed when the task
gets woken up, but 
the state that is really desired "smells like 'I want signal delivery
suspended'" until the end of the code region.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o agreed, noting that the change could be done without adding new
infrastructure and a task flag.  Howells said that manipulating the signal
mask would affect other threads in the process, though, which Ts'o
acknowledged as a problem.  Viro said that an alternative might be to
simply skip the thread in question when doing signal delivery; "basically
it is a 'don't bother me'".
</p>

<p>
The session ran out of time as that was being discussed, but the picture
that emerged is that patches are needed to focus the discussion.  As of
yet, there is no video for this session in the <a

It annoys me when processes become unkillable just because the NFS server or network is flaky. And one slow NFS operation can bring down the whole userspace because it's holding the inode lock...<br>
<p>
Okay, there's a lot of legacy kernel code that cannot deal with interruptions; but if we're talking about a big multi-year effort, why bother with such a kludge for legacy code - instead of making the whole kernel interruptible - or better - non-blocking?<br>
<p>
Network filesystems such as ceph are already implemented in a non-blocking way, but the VFS layer forces them to wrap everything inside blocking calls. So if you do an asynchronous io_uring read, io_uring will call the blocking VFS read in a worker thread, which will then do asynchronous I/O inside the Ceph code - which combines the disadvantages of blocking and non-blocking I/O. You get the combined overhead of both, but I/O is still not interruptible/cancellable.<br>

Dunno how this would work, but an obvious mechanism that *could* work with asynchronous reads is "abandon". <br>
<p>
If you've got an outstanding i/o you can't cancel, you flag it as abandoned, and when it comes back to io_uring or wherever to be processed, it detects it's abandoned and just throws it away.<br>

Generally this isn't really a problem anymore; you can kill -9 processes waiting on NFS now. You cannot _interrupt_ them with random signals because so much code out there isn't written with the assumption that something as simple as a read() or getdents() returns EINTR and might be restarted. (Well, you can if you mount with -o intr, but that's probably not a good idea unless you want to lose reads and writes.)<br>

The answer to "why can't I kill it" is usually to be found in `cat /proc/$pid/stack`. That will tell you where it is sleeping. If you look at that function, you'll see something like a mutex_lock(). Change it to mutex_lock_killable() and handle the -EINTR return correctly. Then send a patch.<br>
<p>
Or send an email pointing at the offender to the appropriate mailing list (probably linux-fsdevel), and ask someone to do it for you.<br>
<p>
These things pretty much have to be found and fixed one by one. It's a lot of work to unroll some of these error cases, so nobody wants to do it for ones which don't matter.<br>

The "-o hard" mount option is not related to interrupts.  It relates to timeouts waiting for a reply from the server.  "-o hard" means "Retry indefinitely".  "-o soft" means "abort after the configured retries".  [Don't use -o soft when you value data]<br>
<p>
The old "-o intr" mount option was related to interrupts.  It doesn't do anything any more.  NFS can always(*) be killed by a fatal signal, and non-fatal signals are always ignored<br>
<p>
(* - there are believed to be some places if VFS/MM code which wait non-killable.  NFS cannot fix that.  As willy says, they need to be found and fixed.  That is a separate issue).<br>
<p>
sendmsg is interruptible - by only if it is told to wait.  NFS (via net/sunrpc) always sets MSG_DONTWAIT.  So sock_sendmsg() when called for NFS never reacts to a signal.  If the send fails due to lack of buffer space (the only time it might abort if there is a signal), EAGAIN is returned to the state-machine in net/sunrpc/clnt.c which will retry or abort depending on context.  If it wants to retry it can get a notification when space is available.  It might abort due to a pending signal, but only if NFS wants that.  If NFS ever wants the request to never-ever abort, even with a fatal signal, it runs the request from a separate kernel thread.<br>
<p>
So I wonder what the real problem is here.<br>

If you're up for fixing something ...<br>
<p>
Last time I looked at this, when NFS closes a file, it calls fsync(). So if you try to kill a process that is in the middle of a write(), the write aborts but when the process dies, it closes all its files and so it hangs in the fsync code.<br>
<p>
I gave up trying to fix this, but the easy way to test is to add a IP route that black holes all traffic to your NFS server's address. Instant flaky NFS server!<br>

<p>
I see it blocking in<br>
<p>
[&lt;0&gt;] folio_wait_writeback+0x22/0xc0<br>
[&lt;0&gt;] __filemap_fdatawait_range+0x79/0xf0<br>
[&lt;0&gt;] filemap_write_and_wait_range+0x83/0xb0<br>
[&lt;0&gt;] nfs_wb_all+0x3f/0x1c0<br>
[&lt;0&gt;] nfs4_file_flush+0x71/0xa0<br>
<p>
and I wonder why __filemap_fdatawait_range() doesn't use folio_wait_writeback_killable().<br>
<p>
I guess it would need to return an error and current callers don't expect one.  So maybe add filemap_write_and_wait_range_killable() which nfs_wb_all_killable() could call and cold be called by nfs4_file_flush and nfs_file_flush (which are only ever called in the close() path).<br>
<p>
However that doesn't work because __fatal_signal_pending() doesn't return True in a process which has exited.   Maybe it should check if PF_SIGNALED is set.<br>
<p>
Maybe I should post patches.<br>

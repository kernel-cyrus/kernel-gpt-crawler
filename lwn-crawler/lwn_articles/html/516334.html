<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2012/">2012 Kernel Summit</a>
</div>
<p>
Over the last few years, the Linux kernel has added features to measure the
integrity of files on disk to protect against offline attacks.  The
integrity measurement architecture (IMA) was added in the 2.6.30 kernel,
and other pieces have followed, but the job is not done.  Dmitry Kasatkin
gave a presentation at the <a
href="http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Linux_Security_Summit_2012">2012
Linux Security Summit</a> (LSS) on an extension to
the integrity subsystem to handle the contents of directories as well as
various 
special files.
</p>

<p>
Integrity protection is needed to prevent attackers from
altering the contents of a filesystem without the kernel's awareness, by
removing the 
disk or booting into an alternative operating system.  Runtime integrity
is already handled by the existing access control mechanisms, Kasatkin
said.  Those include discretionary access control (DAC) mechanisms like the
traditional Unix file permissions or mandatory access control (MAC) schemes
such as those
provided by SELinux or Smack.  But those mechanisms rely on trusting the
access control metadata (e.g. permissions bits or security extended
attributes), which can be tampered with in an offline attack.
</p>

<p>
IMA measures the integrity of files by calculating a cryptographic hash
over the file contents, which is stored in the <tt>security.ima</tt>
extended attribute (xattr).  IMA can also be used in conjunction with a
Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to remotely attest to the integrity of the
running system.
</p>

<p>
The extended verification module (EVM) was added in 3.2 to protect the
inode metadata of files against offline attacks.  That metadata includes the
security xattrs (including 
those for SELinux and Smack along with <tt>security.ima</tt>), mode (permissions),
owner, inode number, etc.  Once again, a hash of the values is used, and
EVM stores that as the <tt>security.evm</tt> xattr on the file.
</p>

<p>
The digital signature extension was added in the 3.3 kernel to allow the
IMA and EVM xattrs to be signed.  In addition to storing a hash value in the
xattrs, a digital signature of the hash value can also be stored and verified.
</p>

<p>
The IMA-appraisal feature, which Kasatkin said is being targeted for 3.7,
will inhibit access to files whose IMA hash does not match the contents
(i.e. the file has been changed offline).  There were some <a
href="/Articles/494158/">locking problems</a> that prevented IMA-appraisal
from being merged earlier, but those have been resolved.
</p>

<p>
But, all of those pieces don't add up to everything needed for real
integrity protection, Kasatkin said.  While EVM protects the inode metadata
and IMA protects the contents of regular files, there is a missing piece:
file names.  In Linux, the inode does not contain the file name, as it
lives in the directory entries, and the association between a file name and
an inode is not protected.
</p>

<p>
The result is that files can be deleted, renamed, or moved in an offline attack
without being detected by the integrity subsystem.  In addition, symbolic links and
device nodes are currently unprotected, which means that those files can be
added, modified, or removed offline without detection.  Various attacks are
possible via 
changing directory entries, he said.  One could delete a file required for
booting, or restore a backup version (and associated security xattrs) of a
program with known vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
Using two virtual machines, Kasatkin simulated an offline attack by
creating files in one VM, then mounting the disk in the other VM and
changing some of the files.  With the existing integrity code (including
IMA-appraisal), he was unable to access files with changed contents in the
original VM, but had no problems accessing files that had been renamed or
moved (nor were deleted files detected).
</p>

<p>
That problem leads to the directory and special file integrity protection
that he 
has <a href="/Articles/512364/">proposed</a>.  For directories, two new
hooks, <tt>ima_dir_check()</tt> and <tt>ima_dir_update()</tt>, would be
added.  The former would be called during path lookup (from
<tt>may_lookup()</tt>) and would deny access if any directory entries in
the path had
been unexpectedly altered. When directories are updated in the running system,
<tt>ima_dir_update()</tt> would be called to
update the integrity 
measurement to reflect those changes.
</p>

<p>
The implementation of the verification starts from the root inode during a
path lookup.  Nothing happens when the filesystem is mounted, the
verification is done lazily during file name lookup.  Whenever a dentry
(directory cache entry) is allocated for a directory, a call is made to
<tt>ima_dir_check()</tt> to verify it.  This proposed callback
does not 
break <a href="/Articles/419811/">RCU path walk</a>, so it should not cause
scalability problems on larger machines. The
integrity measurement is calculated with a hash over the list of entries
in the directory, using the inode number, name, type, and offset values for
each, and storing the result in <tt>security.ima</tt> on the directory
(which is then protected with EVM).
</p>

<p>
For special files, like symbolic links and device nodes, 
there is one new hook that has been added: <tt>ima_link_check()</tt>.
It is called during path lookup (<tt>follow_link()</tt>) and for the
<tt>readlink()</tt> system call. The 
measurement is a hash of the target path for symbolic links or the major
and minor device numbers for device nodes.  Once again, those values are
stored in <tt>security.ima</tt> and are verified before access.
</p>

<p>
The user-space tools used to set the integrity measurements for image
creation also need updating to support the new features.  The
<tt>evmctl</tt> command (part of the ima-evm-utils package) has added the ability to set the reference hashes
for directories and special files.
</p>

<p>
Kasatkin then demonstrated the integrity protections of the new code.  If a
file is moved or removed, the directory holding the file can no longer be
accessed, so commands like <tt>ls</tt> or <tt>cd</tt> fail with an
<tt>EPERM</tt>. He also presented performance numbers that showed relatively
modest decreases compared to IMA/EVM without the directory and special file
handling code, but more substantial declines when compared to not having
IMA/EVM enabled at all.  Interestingly, though, both flavors of IMA/EVM
performed better on a file copy test than did a disk encrypted using
dm-crypt.  Disk encryption is another way to thwart offline attacks, of course.
</p>

<p>
It would seem that the kernel integrity subsystem is approaching
"completion".  The final pieces of the puzzle are now available; Kasatkin
and others are hopeful they will be acceptable upstream soon, though he did
note that the VFS developers had not yet reviewed the most recent patch
set.  For those that need this kind of protection for Linux, though, the
wait may nearly be over.

Hopes that this security can be disabled in situations where you are managing bazillion of small files, like objects files on a compiler server farm...<br>
Also, when your file manager opens your 500 Mbytes video file to display the first image as the icon, is the cryptographic hash of the whole file checked, or just the beginning of the file?<br>
I have directories with *a lot of* ten to hundred of Mbytes video files, and there is no point in reading all that content in memory just to display their icon.<br>

Getting an EPERM error on a directory seems misleading in the situation where integrity verification fails. I'd like to have an error that leads in the right direction.<br>

Thanks for pointing out that the performance is better than using dm-crypt -- it puts it in perspective for me.<br>

      Please tell me if I'm missing something here, but ISTM the two techniques are not replacements for each other.  WRT offline access, dm-crypt is a superset of IMA/EVM.

<p>IMA/EVM is useful if you want to know whether someone has been monkeying with your hard drive while you weren't looking, but does nothing to protect against the NSA reading your data, whereas dm-crypt ensures both no one has modified your data while the system was down, and no one has accessed it, either.

I am not very sure how does it really work, as if you have physical access to the system, and you have one system with IMA in place, why could not the other system fake the IMA?<br>

           </div>
<p>One of the interesting side issues that came up while I was <a href="/Articles/606925/">exploring
cgroups</a> recently was the list management for the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/sched.h?v=3.16#L1224"><code>task_struct</code> data
structure</a> that is used to represent each thread running in a Linux
system.  As noted at the time, some read-side accesses to this list
are managed using RCU, while others are protected by the
<code>tasklist_lock</code> read/write spinlock (updates always use the
spinlock).
  A journey to try to understand the history and context for this inconsistency
  led to both a set of unaddressed opportunities for broader use of RCU, and
  a set of patterns that are useful to both guide and describe that use.
  This is the story of that journey.
</p>
<p>Some highlights from the history of these task lists, and the <tt>tasklist_lock</tt>,
include:</p>

<ul class="spacylist">

<li>the <a
  href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e56d090310d7625ecb43a1eeebd479f04affb48b">first
  step</a> toward RCU management, which appeared in the
  mainline kernel over eight years ago,</li>

<li>a <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/917520">discussion</a> concerning the unfairness of read/write spinlocks in
  Linux and the problems that causes for task list management, in which
  Linus Torvalds both <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/920564">suggested</a> that the read side should be changed
  entirely to use RCU and also <a
  href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/920718">warned against
  it</a>, saying: "<q>The biggest problem is that there will almost inevitably be things
that get missed, and any races exposed by lacking locking will be
<em>very</em> hard to debug and trigger.</q>"

<li>the recent introduction of <a href="/Articles/579729/">qrw_locks</a> that, for x86 in
  Linux 3.16 and presumably for other architectures in due course,
  resolves the fairness issues with standard read/write locks while
  neatly sidestepping the <a
  href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/920044">problems</a>
  that the discussion
  foresaw with fairness (fair read/write locks could cause deadlocks in
  interrupts, so qrw_lock are simply not fair when used in interrupt
  handlers).</li>

<li>Linus <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8myENKt8bD0#t=1640">nominating [YouTube]</a> the <tt>tasklist_lock</tt> as something he would like to
get rid of at the Linux kernel developer panel at LinuxCon North America 2014.
</ul>

<p>For me the most interesting piece of history comes from even longer
ago than these: in 2004, slightly over ten years ago, Paul McKenney's
<a href="http://digitalcommons.ohsu.edu/etd/120/">doctoral dissertation</a>
  was published, which presented a sound basis and
context for RCU.  That work cited <code>tasklist_lock</code> as an example use
case of a pattern described as "Incremental use of RCU".  The
increments have since continued, though slowly.</p>

<p>A major contribution of Paul's dissertation (noted at end of page 96)
was to identify several design patterns, and particularly
"transformational design patterns", that can lead to effective use of
RCU.  As some of the lists of tasks are still not managed using RCU, it
may be educational to review those patterns to see if the remainder
can be "incrementally" "transformed".</p>

<p>The transformation to RCU protection is largely the replacement of
blocking synchronization, such as spinlocks, with non-blocking
synchronization.  Non-blocking read access can cope with some
concurrent changes to data structures, as we shall see, but not with
larger "destructive" changes.  RCU makes non-blocking access possible
by providing a means to defer destructive changes to data until no
non-blocking code could possibly be accessing that data.  This is made
quite explicit in the title of the dissertation:
"<i>Exploiting deferred destruction: an analysis of read-copy-update
techniques in operating system kernels</i>".

<p>It is arguable that EDD (exploiting deferred destruction) might be a more useful name for the technique
than RCU.  The various patterns show ways that a reader can cope with
non-destructive concurrent updates.  A "copy" is sometimes used, but
deferred destruction is always important.</p>

<p>To see how various patterns can apply to task lists, I have divided the
various lists of tasks into five groups that are based roughly on the sort of
transformation required.  Each list can be identified either by the
<code>list_head</code> or <code>hlist_node</code> in
<code>task_struct</code> that is used to link
tasks together, or by the <code>list_head</code> or <code>hlist_head</code> that forms the
head of the list.  Usually I'll use the former, though sometimes the
head has a name that is easier to work with.  These lists are all
doubly-linked lists with both forward and backward pointers
(i.e. <code>next</code> 
and <code>prev</code>).</p>

<h4>Group 1: No transformation</h4>

<p>The first group includes the <code>cg_list</code> that lists tasks in a given
<code>css_set</code> (for cgroups), <code>numa_entry</code> that the fair scheduler uses,
and <code>rcu_node_entry</code> that is used internally by RCU.  Each of these
lists has its own spinlock to provide exclusive access both for
updates and for read access.  So these lists don't make use of RCU at
all.</p>

<p>In chapter 5 of his dissertation, Paul writes:
"<q>Since RCU is not intended to replace all existing synchronization
mechanisms, it is necessary to know when and how to use it.</q>" The
"when" is generally for read-mostly data structures, which these 
three lists appear not to be.  The remaining lists <em>are</em> read-mostly and
for this reason are, or were, protected by the <code>tasklist_lock</code>
reader/writer lock.  Converting them to use RCU is part of the pattern
called "Reader-Writer-Lock/RCU Analogy", which is a meta-pattern that
includes all the other patterns. 
</p>

<h4>Group 2: Simply defer the destruction</h4>

<p>The pattern "RCU Existence Locks" simply guarantees a reader that the
object it is accessing will continue to "exist" at least until the access
is finished.  That is, the memory won't get used for some other purpose.
So a spinlock inside the object will continue to behave like a
spinlock, a counter like a counter and, importantly for linked lists,
a <code>next</code> pointer will continue to point to the <code>next</code> item in the
list, even if the object itself is removed from the list.  This
guarantee is sufficient for it to be safe to walk a list concurrently
with new elements being added, or old elements being removed.</p>

<p>In <code>task_struct</code>, the <code>tasks</code> list and the <code>thread_node</code> list need
just this behavior.  The former is a list of all processes
(technically all tasks which are thread-group leaders) and the latter
is the list of all threads in a given thread group.  In each case, a
task is added at most once and is deleted only just before it is
destroyed.</p>

<p>Inserting into the list requires that the new <code>task_struct</code> be fully
initialized, including the <code>next</code> pointer, before the head of the list
is updated to point to the new structure.</p>

<p><img alt="list insert" src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/list-rcu-add.png" /></p>

<p>The deletion protocol requires that the <code>next</code> pointer in the previous
element be moved past the item being deleted, and then for that item
to continue to exit, with its <code>next</code> pointer intact, until the "grace
period" (as the delay prior to destruction is called) has passed.</p>

<p><img alt="list delete" src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/list-rcu-del.png" /></p>

<p>The protocol for walking the list allows the <code>next</code> pointers to be
followed in sequence and guarantees that you will always get back to
the head of the list.  Other fields in each task must be treated with
some caution.  It is certainly safe to look at any field, but the extent
to which different values can be used depend on the protocols for the
particular fields.  For example, the <code>-&gt;mm</code> field can only be
<a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/oom_kill.c?v=3.16#L94">safely used</a> if the per-thread <code>-&gt;alloc_lock</code> spinlock is taken first.  A
significant reason for Linus's caution noted earlier is that the access
protocol for several fields requires that <code>tasklist_lock</code> be held.
All of these need to be carefully refined to some other sort of
protection before <code>tasklist_lock</code> can be completely discarded.</p>

<p>
The incremental changes that have been happening to task lists since
that first step eight years ago have been the refining of some of
these access protocols to make them less dependent on <tt>tasklist_lock</tt>,
such as the <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e73d84e33f15c099ed1df60437700093cb14e46e">changes to POSIX timers</a> last year.

<h4>Group 3: Transform the way the list is walked</h4>

<p>There is just one list in this third group: the <code>ptrace_entry</code>
list for which the head is the <code>ptraced</code> field, also in <code>task_struct</code>.</p>
<p>A process can use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><code>ptrace()</code></a> to monitor and manage other
tasks, which is a feature particularly used by debuggers.  All of the
tasks that are being traced by a given process are linked in the
<code>ptrace_entry</code> list.  As a process can stop tracing a task at any
time, and some other process could start tracing it, tasks can be
added to and removed from these lists repeatedly, so the simple
Existence Lock is not sufficient.  This is because it isn't practical
to require a "grace period" before changing a traced process's <code>next</code> pointer.</p>

<p>There is only one place where this list is traversed, so adding some
extra care there can make it possible to walk the list with only RCU
protection — no spinlock needed.  <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/exit.c?v=3.16#L1426">That place</a> is the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/wait.2.html"><code>wait()</code></a>
family of system calls.  When (any thread in) the tracing process
calls <code>wait()</code> it will walk the <code>ptraced</code> lists for each thread in the
process looking for traced tasks that need attention.  If another
thread detaches a task just as this one is looking at it, confusion
could ensue unless due care is taken.  In particular, the <code>next</code> link
for the detached process would change and the process calling <code>wait()</code> might
follow it onto a different list.  As the "end of list" is detected by
finding a pointer back to the head of the list, the process walking
this list might never find that head and so could seek forever.</p>

<p><code>wait()</code> will normally walk down the list until it finds a task that
needs attention and will then use a local spinlock or similar
technique to get exclusive access so it can do whatever is required
with the task.  Because this is really just a simple search, there is
little cost in repeating the search from the beginning if anything
peculiar happens.  This quite naturally leads to a simple and safe RCU
protocol:</p>

<ol class="spacylist">

<li>When a task is detached from the tracing process, it must be
   marked as "no longer being traced" <em>before</em> its <code>next</code> pointer is
   changed.  <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/ptrace.c?v=3.16#L49">The code</a> already does this by clearing a flag and
   changing a <code>parent</code> pointer.</li>

<li>When stepping through the <code>next</code> pointer from one task to
   the next, 
   the code needs to check that the first task is still being traced
   by this process <em>after</em> loading the <code>next</code> pointer and <em>before</em>
   making use of that pointer.  If the test succeeds, then the pointer
   leads forward on the correct list and is safe to use.  If it fails,
   then the pointer may lead elsewhere, and the search should start again
   from the beginning.</li>
</ol>

<p>With these two conditions met, we are very nearly guaranteed that there
can be no confusion.  The only remaining question mark concerns the
possibility that a thread is detached and re-attached to the same
process while some other thread is looking at it.  Depending on
exactly where in the list the re-attachment happens, we could end up
visiting some tasks twice, or some tasks not at all.  Clearly the
former is preferred and the code already makes the correct choice.</p>

<p>Two of Paul's patterns are seen here.  First, "Mark Obsolete
Objects" is used to ensure a detached task can be recognized
immediately.  The second is "Global Version Number", even though we
aren't using a version number.</p>

<p>The "Global Version Number" pattern contains two ideas: a version
number that is incremented whenever something changes, and a retry in
the read-side code whenever that change is seen.  
A <a
href="http://www2.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/techreports/survey.2012.09.17a.pdf">retrospective
[PDF]</a> on
RCU usage in Linux that was published in 2012 omits the "Global Version Number"
pattern and instead includes "Retry Readers".  This emphasized that it
is the retry, rather than the version number, that is the key idea.
Using a version number is probably the 
most general way to detect a change; <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/dcache.c?v=3.16#L2128"><code>d_lookup()</code></a> in the filename lookup code is
an excellent example of that.  However, as we found with the
<code>ptraced</code> lists, 
it certainly isn't the only way.</p>

<h4>Group 4: Transforming the update mechanism</h4>

<p>Again we have only one list in this group, and it is strikingly similar
to the <code>ptrace_entry</code> example.  It could be handled in exactly the same
way and, while that would probably be the most pragmatic approach, it
isn't necessarily the most educational.</p>

<p>Each task has a list of child tasks; the head of the list is the
<code>children</code> field of <code>task_struct</code> and the members are
linked
together through the <code>sibling</code> field.  This list <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/exit.c?v=3.16#L1404">is used</a> by the
<code>wait()</code> system call much like the <code>ptrace_entry</code>
list was; it is also
used by the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/oom_kill.c?v=3.16#L444">OOM killer</a> and the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/exit.c?v=3.16#L316">"memory" control group
subsystem</a> to find related processes.</p>
<p>This list is distinctive in that the only time any tasks are moved
from this list to another is a time when all of the tasks are moved to
the same destination.  This happens when the parent process exits.  At
that time, all the children are either discarded completely (which can
be handled with only the Existence Locks pattern) or are moved to the
<code>children</code> list for some ancestor, typically the init process.
With two 
simple changes, it can be safe to search a list with this property
without ever having to restart from the beginning.</p>

<p>The first change is to use an <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/list.h?v=3.16#L587"><code>hlist</code></a> (or "hash list")
instead of a regular list.  With an <code>hlist</code>, the head only points to
the first element, not to the final element as well, and the final
element has a <code>NULL</code> next pointer rather than pointing back to the head.
This second property is key: it means that the ends of all <tt>hlist</tt>s look
the same.</p>

<p>The second change is to splice the whole list of children of the dying
process onto the head of the ancestor process, instead of moving them
one by one.</p>

<p><img alt="list splice" src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/list-rcu-splice.png" /></p>

<p>Now any code that is walking the list of child processes may end up in
the list of children of some other process, but it will not miss out
on any of the children that it is looking for and it will not get
confused about where the end of the list is.  Depending on exactly
what each search is looking for, it may need to be careful not to "find"
any child of the wrong parent, but that is quite trivial to do and not
always even necessary.</p>

<p>This transformation has no clear parallels in Paul's list of
patterns.  That is probably because it is unusual for a list to both be
used for 
   sequential searches and be moved as a whole onto some other list.
</p>

<p>However, the idea of having an easily recognizable "end of list" marker
has emerged clearly since those patterns were described and is
realized more completely in the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/list_nulls.h?v=3.16"><code>hlist_nulls</code></a> list package.
These lists are quite similar to regular <code>hlist</code>s, except that the end
of the list is not a NULL, but is some other value that could not
possibly be a pointer — the least significant bit is always '1'.  When
a search using these lists comes to the end of a list, it can test
whether it is still on the same list it started on.  If it is, the
search is complete.  If not, it may be appropriate to start again from
the beginning.  These lists are used in the networking code, particularly in
the netfilter <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.c?v=3.16#L431">connection tracking</a>.</p>

<h4>Group 5: Transforming the data structures</h4>

<p>The final group of task lists consists of two that we looked at
in the cgroups series: the processes in a session and the processes in
a process group.  These cannot be handled with only Existence Locks,
as a task can be moved once from a session into a newly created
session and a task can be moved repeatedly between process
groups in the one session.</p>

<p>Further, these lists cannot always be handled using "Retry Readers" because they aren't just used for searching.  Both
lists are used to send a signal to each process on the list, the
session list for <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/tty/tty_io.c?v=3.16#L2900">Secure Attention Key handling</a>, and the process-group list for handling <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/signal.c?v=3.16#L1304">control-C typed at a terminal</a> and a variety
of similar needs.  In all cases, the signal must be sent
exactly once to each process.  If a process in the group is forking,
the signal must be delivered either to the parent before it forks, or
to both the parent and the child after the fork.</p>

<p>Paul's dissertation has a pattern that can be applied here:
"Substitute Copy For Original".  As it is easy to insert a new item
and to delete an old item we can effect a move by creating a copy of
the item and inserting that in the new location.  This is not without
a cost, of course: making a copy may not be cheap.

<p>Making a copy of a <code>task_struct</code> is certainly not cheap, particularly
as it is on so many lists and all of these linkages would need to be
adjusted to point to the new <code>task_struct</code>.  This suggests a
simplistic approach is out of the question.  However, there is a simple
expedient that makes the problem a lot more tractable.  We can apply
another pattern: "Impose Level of Indirection".  We can use a proxy.</p>

<p>Rather than placing the full <code>task_struct</code> on the session and process-groups lists, we could place some other smaller structure on those
lists and copy it whenever these lists need to be updated.  This
structure would contain a pointer to the main <code>task_struct</code> which
itself would point back to the proxy structure.  This may sound like a
lot of extra complexity, but luck is on our side, as 
a <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/pid.h?v=3.16#L13">suitable structure</a> already exists.</p>

<p>For every <code>task_struct</code> there is already a <code>struct pid</code> that keeps
track of the different process IDs that the task has in different
namespaces.  <code>task_struct</code> already has a pointer to this and the
<tt>struct pid</tt> points
back to the <code>task_struct</code>.  Moving the session and process-group
linkage out of <code>task_struct</code> and into <code>struct pid</code> would not be
trivial, and it could have performance implications that would need to
be carefully analyzed, but it is by no means impossible — it would be
much cheaper than copying the whole task.</p>

<p>There are a few places in the kernel that maintain pointers to
<code>struct pid</code> for an extended period, particularly in <code>procfs</code> when a
file in some process's directory is held open.  These would need care
to check if the <code>pid</code> had been replaced and to find the new one but,
again, this is a detailed but not a difficult process.  The "Mark Obsolete
Objects" pattern would be used here.</p>

<h4>Once and only once</h4>

<p>There was a second challenge with these lists.  Not only do we need to
be able to move tasks between lists, which appears achievable, but we
also need to process every element in a list once and only once even
in the presence of forking.</p>
<p>There are two important moments in the sequence of forking a process.

<a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/fork.c?v=3.16#L1438">One moment</a> is when the prospective parent checks if there are any
signals pending.  If there are, it will abort the fork, handle the
signals, and then try to fork again (all through the simple expedient
of returning the error code <code>ERESTARTNOINTR</code>).  The <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/fork.c?v=3.16#L1472">second moment</a>
(currently 34 lines later) is when the new child becomes sufficiently
visible in the session and process-group lists that it can receive a signal.</p>

<p>If the signal delivery loop completes before the first of these, or starts
after the second, everything works perfectly.  If any of the loop
happens between them, the child could miss out, which is not
acceptable.  When a spinlock is used, there is no "between".  From the
perspective of any code that also takes the lock, both important
moments are one moment and there is no problem.  When RCU is used,
these are two very different moments.  In order to ensure there is no
"between" there seems to be just one solution: have the first moment
happen after the second.  This is a perfect example of the "Ordered
Update With Ordered Read" pattern from Paul's dissertation.</p>

<p>The "Ordered Update" requires the forking task to check for
pending signals <em>after</em> the new child has been added to the session
and process-group lists.  The "Ordered Read" requirement involves
inserting the new child <em>after</em> the parent rather than at the start of
the list.  As the list will be read in order, so this forces the
signal delivery code to read the parent before the child.</p>

<p>With that sequencing, any signal delivery thread that walks the list of
tasks in order will either signal the parent before it checks for pending
signals, or will also signal the child.</p>

<p>Allowing the child to be visible on these lists immediately, before
aborting the fork and discarding the child, does make the cleaning up a
little bit more complex, but only a little.  The main requirement is
that the "RCU Existence Locks" pattern is used, and that is quite
straightforward.</p>

<p>There are two other places where an operation is performed on every
task in a process group: the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/sys.c?v=3.16#L163">setpriority()</a> system call and the
<a
href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/block/ioprio.c?v=3.16#L61">ioprio_set()</a>
system call.  Neither of these  are currently guaranteed to
affect a new child that is in the process of being forked, so correct
handling of those would be a bonus, and is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<p>Some of the details may seem a little complex, and certainly some are
completely missing, but the key point should be clear.  When using a
spinlock, multiple events are effectively compressed into a single
indivisible moment to avoid races.  With RCU, we cannot avoid having
multiple events in separate moments, but if we carefully design the
events and make them happen in the right order, we can often be just as
effective at avoiding races without the costs of spinning around
waiting for our turn.  Having a quiver of patterns to guide that
design makes it quite manageable.</p>

<h4>Of locks and patterns</h4>

<p>In part, this survey has been about the <code>tasklist_lock</code> and how Linux
could be less dependent on it.  In this, we have only scratched the surface,
as we have only looked at the lists: <code>tasklist_lock</code> protects other
parts of tasks as well.  It is encouraging to find that known patterns
can address all the issues we looked at and it seems likely that if we
examined every field, and the protections that a non-blocking reader
might need, we would find that most, if not all, can be managed using
patterns from this set.</p>

<p>It seems that, at present, there is no pressing need to perform that
examination, since <code>qrwlocks</code> have resolved the fairness issue with
<code>tasklist_lock</code>.  While they are a clear improvement, any spinlock is
still more expensive than none and, as the number of cores in our
computers continues to increase, there may yet come a time when
<code>tasklist_lock</code> becomes a bottleneck.</p>

<p>This survey was also about patterns for providing safe
synchronization.  While I was aware, at least generally, of each of
these patterns, I did not know their names until finding and reading
Paul's dissertation.  Having a list of known named patterns
makes it much easier to discuss and analyze some of these issues.</p>

<p>Patterns like this have some value when written down, but much more
value when imprinted on people's brains.  They are now firmly in my
brain and if they have left any impression on you, then maybe we will
be a little more ready the next time a spinlock needs to be refined away.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

And excellent point about the lack of a pattern covering list splicing!<br>
<p>
An additional instance of this pattern may be found in Thomas Graf's implementation (<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/2/35">https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/2/35</a>) of Josh Triplett's resizeable hash tables (<a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/atc11/tech/final_files/Triplett.pdf">http://www.usenix.org/event/atc11/tech/final_files/Triple...</a>).<br>
<p>
It might take some thought to formulate a pattern for this, but in the meantime I do very much appreciate your calling my attention to it.<br>

Once and only once is insufficient to guarantee that a signal is delivered to all processes in a process group.<br>
<p>
Posix guarantees and reasonable user space programs require that there will be some moment in time where a signal is delivered to all target tasks.<br>
<p>
Copying of data structures seems insufficient for signal delivery, as that appears to allow a case when a process receives two signals when user space semantics require exactly one of the signals to be receved.  With the size of RCU grace periods I expect that would be easy to observe.<br>
<p>
So no.  I do not believe in the least you have shown that signal delivery can be converted to using RCU lists.<br>

Hi Eric,<br>
 thanks for your observations.<br>
<p>
Can you provide a reference to that Posix guarantee of "some moment in time", or a discussion of it?  I cannot find anything and am not familiar with that guarantee.<br>
<p>
Your second point is, I think, about possible races between getpgid and signal delivery. Maybe you imagine a signal being delivered to two different process groups while a process is being moved from one to the other?  Certainly such races needed to be considered and the range of valid outcomes understood.  I see no reason to think it would be particularly difficult to ensure correct outcomes, but it probably wouldn't be trivial either.  Without concrete code it is, of course, not possible to be definite.<br>
<p>
Problems caused by long grace periods can sometimes be countered using "Mark Obsolete Objects".  That could apply here.<br>

<p>
The quality of Linux kernel releases is of interest to every developer.
Few people are better placed to discuss this topic than Andrew Morton, who
has put years of his life into improving how kernels are created.  In the
session he led on this topic, Andrew was unable to say whether he thought
our kernel releases were getting better or worse.  But he had no doubt that
we could be doing a better job than we are now.
<p>

For some time, Andrew has wanted a kernel bugmaster to help him in tracking
and fixing problems.  That person has materialized in the form of Natalie
Protasevich.  Andrew says he had hoped for "a nasty person" who would hang
out on the mailing lists and beat up on developers who do not fix bugs;
Natalie is not that person.  But she is doing a good job of managing the
bug database and getting reports to the relevant people.
<p>

There are currently 1500 open bugs in the kernel bugzilla; Natalie is
cleaning them up and passing them on to developers.  When those developers
respond, the results appear to be good.  But not very many developers are
doing that.
<p>

We have a big problem in that a whole lot of bug reports are getting lost.
They get reported to subsystem mailing lists and subsequently forgotten
about.  Bug reporters can go away for a number of reasons, many of which
have little to do with the bug being fixed.  In general, lost bugs are not
necessarily fixed bugs.
<p>

Andrew asserts that bug reports must be responded to quickly or the chances
of getting that bug fixed drop tremendously.  He made productive use of his
flight to Cambridge by digging through a few thousand linux-kernel
messages; he found some 50 bug reports which had not been responded to in
any way.  There were reports which were relevant to people who had found
the time to participate fully in the recent BSD licensing flame war, but
who were unable to get around to dealing with bugs.  Andrew says that he is
getting tired of nagging people; in general, this behavior does not seem
particularly mature.
<p>

Linus noted that many people no longer read the linux-kernel mailing list.
The traffic has reached a level where it is simply overwhelming.  It was
suggested that perhaps a separate list for bug reports is needed.

<p> 

Dave Jones reiterated his statement that developers are not responding to
bug reports.  We are, as a result, losing bug reporters.  Andrew brought up
the old idea of doing an occasional bugfix-only release.  Such a release
would not just avoid the addition of new features; developers would be
expected to spend time actively fixing bugs.  Perhaps this would send a
message that the developers have gotten serious about bug fixing and would
inspire long-frustrated users to start reporting bugs again.
<p>

Ted Ts'o said that once upon a time, ten years ago, we cared about our
bug-free kernel and would help users with problems.  It is kind of sad that
we no longer have that attitude.  In response it was pointed out that the
volume of users (and their bug reports) has increased greatly, and that the
level of technical knowledge held by our users is now much lower.  As Alan
Cox put it, ten years ago every user had a screwdriver and most of them did
not have the case on their computer.
<p>

Alan also claimed that the larger number of users could also be helpful in
finding bugs, but that we are not making use of their reports.  With
adequate information and a bit of statistics, it could become much easier
to identify combinations of hardware that lead to problems.  To that end,
better bug reporting tools would be most helpful.  And, in particular,
having a single tool (or at least a tool by a single name) supported by all
distributors would be a good thing.  If developers could ask users to run
this tool to generate a comprehensive picture of the afflicted system, they
would be better positioned to track down the problems.
<p>

Andrew's response is that the discussion had taken a wrong turn.  There is
no point, he says, in having better tools if developers cannot be bothered
to respond to bugs in the first place.  He then moved on to the review
problem.  Code review, he says, has a large multiplier effect.  One hour of
serious code review can help to get a 100-hour patch into the kernel, and
it can help developers to make better patches in the future.  But we suffer
from a shortage of reviewers.
<p>

One problem is that code can quickly disappear into git repositories, from
which it speeds into the mainline without much (or any) review.  In
response to previous pleas, developers have been posting code to the
mailing lists more often, but these postings are often late, just before
the code heads toward the mainline.  Quite a bit of code is going into
subsystem trees during the merge window, ensuring that the review period is
quite brief.  In response it was stated that subsystem maintainers should
not accept patches during the merge window.  Some maintainers already
enforce such a policy, but others do not.
<p>

One idea which was discussed was the creation of a pre-merge tree which
contains all of the patches expected to go in during the next merge
window.  It would be much like -mm, but with the full set of queued patches
and nothing which is not planned for the next merge window.  Andrew
claimed, once again, that the wrong problem was being discussed.  Why talk
about getting more patches posted when the patches which are sent out now
are not being reviewed?
<p>

Andrew's proposal is that patches, to be accepted in the mainline, must
carry a new <tt>Reviewed-by:</tt> tag identifying who has looked them
over.  The patch information should also include information like pointers
to the discussions with the reviewer so that the depth of the review can be
judged; a Reviewed-by tag from a reviewer who is mostly concerned with white
space might not have a whole lot of value.  If nobody reviews patches, the
system will clog up until developers <i>have</i> to do some reviewing just
to get things moving again.
<p>

The idea was well received, though Linus expressed a concern that most
patches, being in general quite small, will never really get serious
review.  A patch which looks trivial is hard to give a lot of attention
to.  But some of those patches will certainly carry bugs.  So stronger
review requirements will, in a world inhabited by humans, still not succeed
in catching all of the silly problems.  This point was generally understood,
but there is still interest in trying out this system in an informal way.
So expect to start seeing Reviewed-by tags on patches before too long.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
As the size and complexity of the codebase has gone up, has the community done an adequate job to ensure that 'technical knowlegde' is imparted to the wannabees (like me)?<br>
<p>
Thanks to the likes of Steve French and Greg KH for putting in the time to break things down to the crayon level.  More of that, please.<br>
<p>
There is a certain nietzschean charm in staring at a kernel tree as if it were an elaborate kitted sweater and asking: 'OK, where is the end of this thing?'.  However, if bringing in more developers to improve the project is a goal, then work like Landley's on the documentation is of paramount importance.<br>
<p>
As a suggestion, take the setup code and explain it in nauseating detail.  If you can envision the genesis of the kernel as it boots, you have a good model.<br>
<p>
Another thing that would really help *a lot* would be to integrate the LXR project into kbuild as a new target.  Not a perl jockey, I haven't gotten around to making LXR actually work, but I see where it would lower the impedence to studying the code.<br>
<p>
Maybe in a couple of years I'll have learned enough to do more and talk less.  Thanks.<br>

      having a reviewed by tag sounds like a good idea to me.  where do we get reviewers?<br>
<p>
I know this is a pipe dream, but "unit-tested-by" tag could be cool too.<br>

      solution here: enable users to submit kernel bugs in a gui in the same way as Ubuntu collects bug reports (Help -&gt; Report Bug . . . menu item.)<br>
<p>
Ask the distro's or have it as a feature one can easy turn on- I have submitted kernel bugs the old way- it got fixed, but I have to say there has to be a better solution....<br>
<p>
Think of all the new users, that might generate bugs- because their usage is different than your's..<br>

      For many users, the fact that they can successfully boot to a graphical desktop and access the Internet means that they don't have any kernel bugs of concern to begin with.<br>
<p>
More importantly, as noted in the article above: "Andrew's response is that the discussion had taken a wrong turn. There is no point, he says, in having better tools if developers cannot be bothered to respond to bugs in the first place."<br>

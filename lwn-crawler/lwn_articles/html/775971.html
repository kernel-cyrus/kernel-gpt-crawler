<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 4, 2019</br>
           </div>
One of the useful features added during the 4.20 development cycle was the
availability of <a href="/Articles/759781/">pressure-stall information</a>,
which provides visibility into how resource-constrained the system is.
Interest in using this information has spread beyond the data-center
environment where it was first implemented, but it turns out that there some
shortcomings in the current interface that affect other use cases.  Suren
Baghdasaryan has posted <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181214171508.7791-1-surenb@google.com/">a patch
set</a> aimed at making pressure-stall information more useful for the
Android use case â€” and, most likely, for many other use cases as well.
<p>
As a reminder, the idea behind the pressure-stall mechanism is to track the
amount of time that processes are unable to execute because they are
waiting for resources (for CPU time, memory, and I/O bandwidth in
particular).  For 
example, reading <tt>/proc/pressure/memory</tt> will yield output like:
<p>
<pre>
    some avg10=70.24 avg60=68.52 avg300=69.91 total=3559632828
    full avg10=57.59 avg60=58.06 avg300=60.38 total=3300487258
</pre>
<p>
This output says that at least one process has been blocked waiting for
memory 70.24% of the time over the last ten seconds, or 68.52% of the time
over the last minute.  In the last ten seconds, <i>all</i> processes have
been stalled 57.59% of the time, indicating a system that is seriously
short of memory.  An orchestration system monitoring this system would see
that over half the CPU time is going to waste because the demands on memory
are too high; corrective action is probably indicated.
<p>
The Android runtime system also tries to manage the set of running processes to
make the best use of the hardware while providing acceptable response times
to the user.  When memory gets tight, for example, background processes may
be killed to ensure that the application the user is engaging with at the
moment has the resources it needs to run quickly.  The pressure-stall
information has some obvious utility when it comes to this kind of
automated resource management: it provides exactly the kind of information
needed to determine whether the system's response time is being affected by
a shortage of memory.
<p>
The problem, from the Android point of view, is that the information
provided is too little and too late.  The highest-resolution information
available is aggregated over ten seconds; that is entirely adequate for
most data-center settings, but it's far too slow for a device that is
interacting directly with users.  If it takes ten seconds to learn that the
device is getting sluggish, the user is likely to be getting grumpy by the
time any corrective action is taken.  Such users might well conclude that
they are better off not staring into their phone all day, and that would
clearly be bad for the industry as a whole.
<p>
The answer to this problem is to extend the pressure-stall mechanism to
allow for high-frequency monitoring of stall data.  With the patch set
applied, an interested application can open <tt>/proc/pressure/memory</tt>
for write access, then write a line containing three pieces of
information:
<p>
<pre>
    type stall-trigger time-window
</pre>
<P>
The <tt>type</tt> value is either <tt>some</tt> (indicating that
information about any stalled process is wanted) or <tt>full</tt> (limiting
the information to full-system stalls where no process can run).
<tt>stall-trigger</tt> indicates (in microseconds) the stall time that will
trigger an event, and <tt>time-window</tt> is the time period over which
that stall time happens.  So, for example, writing:
<p>
<pre>
    full 100000 1000000
</pre>
<p>
will cause the monitor to trigger when the system stalls for a minimum of
100ms over any 1s period.  The minimum <tt>time-window</tt> is 500ms, while
the maximum is 10s.  The <tt>stall-trigger</tt> can also be expressed as a
percentage value; "<tt>10%</tt>" asks for a stall time that is 10% of the
given time window.
<p>
Having requested a stall notification, the application can then pass the
file descriptor to <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html"><tt>poll()</tt></a>.
An exceptional condition (<tt>POLLPRI</tt>) event will be returned whenever
a notification is generated.  A monitoring system can thus be notified
within a half-second of the system starting to become unresponsive and act
to address the situation.

There can be multiple processes monitoring the same stall information with
different triggers and time windows.  As is the case with the current
pressure stall information, the new mechanism is aware of control groups;
opening the relevant files within a memory control-group hierarchy will provide
information on the members of that group only.
<p>

The actual tracking of stall times
has been kept simple to avoid adding to the load on the system.  For each
monitor, the accumulated stall time is checked ten times for each time
window.  If the current window is 50% past, the calculated stall value will
be the time accumulated so far in this window, plus 50% of the total from
the previous window.  This mechanism assumes that the situation will not
change hugely from one window to the next; the benefit is that it only has
to store a single past value for each monitor.  The monitoring is turned
off entirely if no stall events are occurring, so its overhead should be
zero on a lightly loaded system.
<p>
The end result, Baghdasaryan says, is good:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	With these patches applied, Android can monitor for, and ward off,
	mounting memory shortages before they cause problems for the user.
	For example, using memory stall monitors in userspace low memory
	killer daemon (lmkd) we can detect mounting pressure and kill less
	important processes before [the] device becomes visibly sluggish.
</div>
<p>
The functionality provided by this patch set seems clearly worthwhile, but
the code itself is going to need a bit of work yet.  The biggest <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181217145754.GB2218@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">complaint</a>
came from Peter Zijlstra, who doesn't like the elimination of the "idle
mode" that stops data collection entirely when little is going on.  Keeping
the collection running will prevent the system from going into its deepest
idle states, which will not be good for power consumption.  Some sort of
solution to that problem will need to be found before this code can go
upstream.
<p>
There were also some comments on the string-parsing code added by the patch
set; it may be simplified by eliminating the percentage option described
above.  Beyond that, it seems clear that this is a welcome addition to the
system's load-monitoring functionality.  Chances are it will find its way
upstream before too long.  How long it will be stalled before finding its
way into production handsets is rather less clear, of course.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Rebooting a system to apply a security update is a pain.  In some
situations, it's more than a pain; for various reasons, many systems cannot
be taken down at all without compromising the work they are supposed to be
doing.  Back in April, LWN <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/280058/">looked
at Ksplice</a>, a mechanism designed to enable the installation of kernel
updates without the need to reboot the system.  Since then, work has
continued on Ksplice, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308241/">a new
version</a> has been posted, and the project is starting to push toward
mainline inclusion.  So another look is called for.
<p>
The core idea behind Ksplice remains the same: when given a source tree and
a patch, it builds the kernel both with and without the patch and looks at
the differences.  To that end, the compilation procedure is modified to
put every function and data structure into its own executable section.
That makes life a little harder for the compiler and the linker, but
developers are notably insensitive to the difficulties faced by those
tools.  With things split up this way, it is relatively easy to identify a
minimal set of changes in the binary kernel image which result from the
patch.  Ksplice can then, with some care, patch the new code into the
running kernel.  Once this work is done, the old kernel is running the new
code without ever having been rebooted.
<p>
This technique works well for code changes, but different challenges come
with changes to data structures.  Back in April, Ksplice could not handle
that kind of change.  Even so, the project's developers claimed to be able
to apply the bulk of the kernel's security updates using ksplice.  Since
then, though, the developers have applied some energy to this problem.
With the addition of a couple of new techniques - which require extra
effort on the part of the person preparing the patch for Ksplice - it is
now possible to apply 100% of the 65 non-DOS security patches released for
the kernel since 2005.
<p>
In some cases, a kernel patch will simply require that a data structure be
initialized differently.  The way to handle this change in an update
through Ksplice is to modify the relevant data structures on the fly.  To
effect such changes, a patch can be modified to include code like the following:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;ksplice-patch.h&gt;

    ksplice_apply(void (*func)());
</pre>
<p>
While Ksplice is applying the changes - and while the rest of the system is
still stopped - the given <tt>func</tt> will be called.  It can then go
rooting through the kernel's data structures, changing things as needed.
For example, <a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0007">CVE-2008-0007</a>
came about as a result of a failure by some drivers to set the
<tt>VM_DONTEXPAND</tt> flag on certain <tt>vm_area_struct</tt> structures.
Ksplice is able to apply the fix to the drivers without trouble, but that
is not helpful for any incorrectly-initialized VMAs present on the running
system.  So <a
href="http://www.ksplice.com/cve/cve-2008-0007-ksplice-changes.patch">the
modifications to the patch</a> add some functions which set
<tt>VM_DONTEXPAND</tt> on existing VMAs, then use <tt>ksplice_apply()</tt>
to cause those functions to be executed.  The result is a fully-fixed
system.
<p>
Changes to data structure definitions are harder.  If a structure field is
removed, the Ksplice version of the patch can just leave it in place.  But
the addition of a new field requires more complicated measures.  Simply
replacing the allocated structures on the fly seems impractical; finding
and fixing all pointers to those structures would be difficult at best.  So
something else is needed.
<p>
For Ksplice, that something else is a "shadow" mechanism which allocates a
separate structure to hold the new fields.  Using shadow structures is a
fair amount of additional work; the original patch must be changed in a
number of places.  Code which allocates the affected structure must be
modified to allocate the shadow as well, and code which frees the structure
must be changed in similar ways.  Any reference to the new field(s) must,
instead, look up the shadow structure and use that version of the field.
All told, it looks like a tiresome procedure which has a significant chance
of introducing new bugs.  There is also the potential for performance
issues caused by the linear linked list search performed to find the shadow
structures.  The good news is that it is only rarely necessary to modify a
patch in this way.
<p>
The Ksplice developers do not appear to be done yet; from the latest patch
posting:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	We're currently working on the problem of making it feasible to
	apply the entire stable tree using Ksplice.  Although Ksplice's
	original evaluation focused on patches for CVEs, we understand the
	idea that "security bugs are just 'normal bugs'"  (i.e.,
	tracking security bugs separately from normal bugs can be difficult
	and isn't necessarily advisable).  We ultimately want to provide to
	long-running machines hot updates for all of the bug fixes that go
	into the corresponding stable tree.
</div>
<p>
This is an ambitious goal; a single stable series can add up to hundreds of
changes, some of which can be reasonably large.  It will be interesting to
see how many users are really interested in this particular sort of update;
sites running critical systems tend to have older "enterprise" kernels
which are no longer receiving stable tree updates.  But a Ksplice which is
flexible enough to handle that kind of update stream should also be useful
for distributors wanting to provide no-reboot patches to their customers.
<p>
Meanwhile, Nikanth Karthikesan has posted a facility called <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308236/">kreplace</a>.  On the surface, it
looks similar to Ksplice, but the goal is a little different: its purpose
is to allow a developer to quickly try out a change on a running kernel.
Kreplace works by simply patching out and replacing one or more functions
in the kernel.  Kreplace may have its value, but the initial reaction has
not been greatly enthusiastic.  Among other things, it has been <a
href="/Articles/308421/">pointed out</a> that Ksplice also has a facility
to allow for quick experimentation with changes - though it will be quick
only if the developer is already set up to use Ksplice with the running
kernel.
<p>
A final concern with either of these solutions is that they are, for all
practical purposes, employing rootkit techniques.  A mechanism which can be
used by distributors to patch running systems can also be (mis)used by others.
Vendors of binary-only modules could, for example, use Ksplice or kreplace
to get around GPL-only exports and other inconvenient features of
contemporary kernels.  Crackers could also use it, of course, but they
already have their own rootkit tools and gain no real benefit from an
officially-supported runtime patching mechanism.  Whether this aspect of
Ksplice is of concern to the development community may be seen in the
coming months as this code gets closer to mainline inclusion.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I worry about any mechanisms that will by force be very rarely used in earnest, and that just can't really be tested for that exact use case before live use. This is just an invitation to trigger Murphy's law.
<p>
If the machine is really that indispensable, it should be well protected, and some fail-over provisions should be in place, its applications presumably would be set up to checkpoint and restart; all this regardless of any kernel-replace-while-running wizardry. This problem space has other, well-tested (but sadly much less geeky and exciting) solutions at hand, and has had for some time.

<p>
It's not always quite that simple. That sort of thing can work well for 
services with relatively little state, accessed over the network, but it 
doesn't work so well for things like desktop systems that tend to have 
applications with lots of unique in-memory state, persistent network 
connections etc. 
<p>
Now, you might think that rebooting a personal desktop isn't such a big 
deal, but imagine it's a terminal server with sessions running for tens 
of users, and an update comes out for a local root hole. You've either 
got the choice of chucking all your users off (quite possibly to another 
system, but it's still disruptive) or leaving the hole unpatched, neither 
of which options are terribly appealing. This sort of live patching 
approach offers a potential way out.

People upgrade their kernels all the time. People generally don't like re-booting their machines.
<p>
Why are you worrying that this feature would be "very rarely used"?

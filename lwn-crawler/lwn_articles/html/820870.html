The purpose of a cpuidle governor is to decide which idle state a CPU
should go into when it has no useful work to do; the cpuidle <i>driver</i>
then actually puts the CPU 
into that state.  But, at the 2020 <a
href="http://retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit/">Power Management and Scheduling
in the Linux Kernel summit</a> (OSPM), Abhishek Goel presented a new
cpuidle driver that doesn't actually change the processor's power state at all.
Such a driver will clearly save no power, but it can be quite useful as a
tool for evaluating and debugging cpuidle policies.
<p>
Goel began by saying that this work was motivated by a performance problem
encountered with high-latency idle states â€” deep CPU sleep states that take
a long time to restart from.  A GPU-oriented workload that generated lots
of interrupts was involved; the time between those interrupts was just
enough to cause the governor to choose a deep idle state.  That created
latency which added up over time as the workload progressed.  The temporary
workaround was to increase the target latency (the expected sleep time) for
those idle states by a factor of three to five, biasing the idle-state
choice toward the shallower states.  It solved the problem, but is "not
elegant"; others will undoubtedly find workloads that go wrong in other
ways.
<p>
Rafael Wysocki interjected to suggest using the <a
href="/Articles/386139/">pm_qos mechanism</a> instead; its purpose is to
address just this sort of latency issue, and he was curious to know why it
didn't work.  Part of the problem, evidently, is that pm_qos will disable
the deeper idle states entirely, but there can be value in having them
remain available for the truly long idle periods.  Parth Shah added that,

<a href="/Articles/820871/"><img

title="Abhishek Goel" class="rthumb"></a> 

on the Power architecture, this is even more true; without getting to those
deeper idle states little energy will be saved.
<p>
Goel tried providing a debugfs interface for the cpuidle core that would
allow the residency attributes of the various idle states to be tweaked at
run time.  It is useful for validating idle states, he said, but
synchronization of the changes within the kernel is painful.  Changing
these attributes can also lead to strange behavior due to distortions of
the CPU's idle history.  He wanted a better solution.
<p>
The result was the pseudo cpuidle driver.  It is a loadable module that
allows the user to create customized idle states and tweak the attributes
as they go.  Doing things this way avoids both the synchronization and
history-distortion problems.  The module is loaded with a set of parameters
describing the number of states, along with the target residency and exit
latency of each.  The actual "idle states" are implemented by putting the
CPU into a busy-wait loop, spinning until the next wakeup event happens;
the governor then spins a bit longer to simulate the exit latency time.
<p>
This behavior clearly does a poor job of saving power, but it is useful to
evaluate how specific policies affect system performance.  It can be used
for tuning a governor, or to compare the effects of different governors
entirely.  It also turns out to be useful for CPU design, he said;
designers can try out various idle states and see how they will actually
perform.
<p>
Future work, he concluded, could include simulating idle states at the core
and chip levels as well as basic CPU states.  He is also planning to add
some tracing capabilities to the driver.
<p>
Wysocki led off the discussion by pointing out one potential problem.  In a
real system, the response to a hardware interrupt will be delayed by the
exit latency of the processor.  The only way to simulate that delay would
be to do the busy-waiting with interrupts disabled, but then the interrupt
(which would normally wake the system) will be missed entirely.  That
particular aspect of hardware behavior, it seems, cannot be emulated in
this way.  That said, he agreed that the driver looks useful for studying
cpuidle governors, and seems worth having.
<p>
At the conclusion of the session, Juri Lelli asked if there were any sort
of performance numbers comparing this driver with real hardware; Goel
answered that he didn't have those yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

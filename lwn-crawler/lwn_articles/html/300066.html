           </div>
On the final day of the Linux Plumbers Conference, Keith Packard ran a
microconference dedicated to future displays.  A number of topics were
discussed there, but the key session had to do with the near-term future of
Linux video drivers.  Longtime LWN readers will be more than familiar with
the story: Linux has multiple subsystems charged with managing graphics
hardware, the user-space driver model adopted by XFree86 leads to all kinds
of problems, support for 3D graphics is not what it should be, etc.  That
whole story was recounted here, but with a notable difference: solutions
are in the final stabilization stages, and these problems will soon be
history.
<p>

<a href="/Articles/300086/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/lpc-ks-2008/display-session-sm.jpg" width=150 height=103
alt="[Display session]" border=0 align="right" hspace=2></a>

There are two major components to the work which is being done: graphics
memory management and kernel-based mode setting.  A contemporary graphics
processor (GPU) is really a CPU in all respects, including the possession
of a sophisticated memory management unit.  Managing the sharing of memory
between user space, the kernel, and the GPU is fundamental to the
implementation of correct, high-performance graphics.  One year ago, the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/257417/">TTM subsystem</a> looked like the
solution to the memory management problem, but TTM grew increasingly
unworkable as the understanding of the problem improved.  So now the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/283793/">Graphics Execution Manager (GEM)</a>
code looks like the way forward; it is currently being prepared for merging
into the mainline kernel.
<p>

Kernel-based mode setting, instead, is meant to get user-space code out of
the business of messing around directly with the hardware.  Putting the
kernel in charge of the configuration of the video adapter has a long list
of advantages.  Suspend and resume have a much better chance of working,
for example.  Once the X server stops accessing hardware directly, it no
longer needs to run as root; having that much untrusted code running with
full privileges has made people nervous for many years.  In the current
scheme, the kernel cannot change the graphics mode if it needs to; that
means that, for example, if the system panics, a graphical user will never
see the message.  With kernel-based mode setting, the kernel can switch to
a different mode and allow the user to frantically try to read the message
before it scrolls off the screen.  Kernel-based mode setting will also make
fast user switching work much better, without the need to use a separate
virtual terminal for each user session.
<p>

One of the first topics of discussion was: how does the kernel decide when
to switch to the panic screen to show the user an important message?  There
are quite a few different paths by which the kernel can indicate distress;
should a kernel message be presented every time a <tt>WARN_ON()</tt>
condition is encountered?  There would appear to be a need to unify the
error paths in the kernel to help simplify this kind of decision.  <strike>Linus
Torvalds</strike> Jesse Barnes suggested that the kernel could simply switch on every message
emitted with <tt>printk()</tt>, on the theory that such a policy would lead
to a rapid and welcome reduction in kernel verbosity.
<p>

The real debate in this session, though, had to do with development
process.  As has been <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/296444/">discussed
previously on LWN</a>, much of the video driver work is done outside of the
mainline kernel tree.  We are now seeing a big chunk of that work being
prepared for a merge.  But the new mode setting interface is a big API
change which will require adjustments from user space; a new kernel
expecting to handle mode setting may not give the best results when run
with an older user space X server.  So there will be a big flag day of
sorts when everything changes and all of the new code gets run for the
first time.
<p>

Linus is not pleased with the notion of a video graphics flag day; he made
a long appeal for a more incremental approach to fixing the video driver
work.  In his opinion, the flag day will lead to a whole bunch of untested
code being made active all at once; there will certainly be design mistakes
which show up, and the whole thing will fail to work properly.  At which
point another flag day will be required.  Linus was not impressed by the
claim that Fedora users have selflessly been testing this code for
everybody; in his view, the kernel developers are not doing this testing.
He sees the whole thing as a recipe for disaster.
<p>

The real problem - and the reason for the out-of-tree development - is that
all of this work requires the creation of a number of new, complex
user-space ABIs.  That is true for both mode setting and memory management,
and the two cannot be easily separated from each other.  Until the
combination as a whole is seen to work, the video driver developers simply
cannot commit themselves to a stable user-space interface - and that means
that their code cannot be merged.
<p>

As an example, TTM was cited.  Had that code been pushed when it looked
like the right solution, there would now be even bigger problems to solve.
<p>

In summary, the graphics developers believe that the approach they are
taking is as incremental as they can make it.  Whether they convinced Linus
of that fact is unclear, but he eventually seemed to accept the plan.  He
did ask for them to push the mode setting code upstream first, but that
code cannot work without memory management support.  So GEM will go into
the mainline ahead of kernel-based mode setting.  Once everything is in the
kernel, it will be possible to boot a system with either kernel-based or
user-space mode setting, so both new and old distributions will be
supported.  Someday, in the distant future, support for mode setting in
user space can be removed.  Much sooner than that, though, we should all be
running much-improved graphics code and will have long since forgotten how
things used to be.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Well in that case, why won't they change their mind again?

If we had started 10 years ago, maybe X11 would be ready by now.  Instead we had 10 years of X11 being able to lock up the machine from userspace.
<br><br>
In any case, <a href="http://lwn.net/1998/0226/#kernel">http://lwn.net/1998/0226/#kernel</a> shows that the issues haven't really changed that much over the years.

Oh, KGI brings back memories... I ran a KGI patched kernel for a while in  <br>
90's because working with the framebuffer was so much nicer with it (I  <br>
just needed to patch it to get "dead keys" working).  KGI MGA driver was  <br>
superior to what was in kernel and KGI drivers were nicely modularized  <br>
unlike the default kernel gfx code at that time. I was really disappointed  <br>
that KGI didn't get in, I had gotten used to nice graphical text consoles  <br>
with earlier Atari &amp; Amiga and at some uni machines and x86 Linux text <br>
console was a step backwards.<br>

The kernel does not lack for memory allocators, so one might well question
the need for yet another one.  As <a
href="/ml/bpf/20220623003230.37497-1-alexei.starovoitov@gmail.com/">this
patch set</a> from Alexei Starovoitov makes clear, though, the BPF
subsystem feels such a need.  The proposed new allocator is intended to
increase the reliability of allocations made within BPF programs, which might
be run in just about any execution context.
<p>
Allocating memory in the kernel can be tricky in the best of situations.
Depending on the execution context at the time, the memory-management
subsystem may or may not have various options available to find memory if
an allocation request cannot be immediately satisfied.  For example, memory
can be freed by pushing 
its contents out to persistent storage, but if memory is requested from
within a filesystem, calling back into that filesystem to write out data
could cause deadlocks and is thus not an option.  In many kernel contexts,
it is not possible to 
sleep to wait for memory to become free.  If the kernel is currently
handling a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-maskable_interrupt">non-maskable
interrupt (NMI)</a> from the CPU, the options are even 
more limited.
<p>
Most kernel code is written to run within a specific context and with an
awareness of the available memory-allocation options; that information is
passed to the memory-management subsystem via the GFP flags supplied with
allocation requests.  When a specific function can be invoked in multiple
contexts, it generally must allocate memory as if it were always running in
the most restrictive possible context; 
this can be inconvenient for developers.
<p>
Over the years, mechanisms like
<a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/mm-api.html?highlight=mempool#memory-pools">memory
pools</a> ("mempools"), which pre-allocate a certain amount of memory to
ensure that it will be available when it is needed, have been developed to
make life easier.  Naturally, mempools quickly created a new problem:
kernel developers adopted mempools as a way of insulating
themselves from memory-allocation failures.  Before long, much
of the kernel's memory was tied up in mempools and unavailable where it was
actually needed.  Over the years, a balance has mostly been found between
overenthusiastic mempool use  and being unable to allocate memory in
critical situations.
<p>
<h4>Mempools for BPF</h4>
<p>
BPF programs can be run in just about any context imaginable; that is
especially true of tracing programs.  A given BPF program might be attached
to a function that runs in atomic context, in response to hardware
interrupts, or even one that handles NMIs.  That makes allocation of memory
an uncertain affair and that, in turn, makes life harder for the BPF
verifier, which is meant to ensure that BPF programs will be well-behaved
in all situations.  BPF programs do not normally allocate memory directly,
but they can do so indirectly by, for example, storing data in a BPF map.
Having such an operation fail can create any number of follow-on problems.
<p>
The proposed BPF-specific allocator can be thought of as a sort of mempool
that is specialized for the needs of BPF programs.  As with mempools, the
purpose is to create a cache of pre-allocated memory in a relatively
relaxed context so that it
is readily available in more restrictive times.  While a mempool is, at its
core, a cache made up of a single list of available objects of a single size, the BPF
caches are somewhat more elaborate.  At a minimum, a BPF cache consists of
two lists of free objects of a single size (one for most allocations, one for
allocations while 
handling NMIs) â€” for every CPU in the system.  A more elaborate variant has
eleven pairs of per-CPU lists for objects of eleven different sizes; that
is 22&nbsp;free-object lists for each CPU.
<p>
The core mechanism is straightforward enough: when a BPF program needs to
allocate memory, it calls into the cache much as if it were calling <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/mm-api.html?highlight=kmem_cache_alloc#c.kmem_cache_alloc"><tt>kmem_cache_alloc()</tt></a>
(for a single-size cache) or <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/mm-api.html?highlight=kmalloc#c.kmalloc"><tt>kmalloc()</tt></a>
(for objects of variable size).
A free object  will be removed from the appropriate list for the
current CPU and returned to the caller; an NMI-specific list will be used
only if an NMI is being handled at the time.  When objects are freed, they
are returned to the appropriate per-CPU list for the current CPU, which may
not be the CPU on which they were allocated.  These operations are performed
with interrupts and migration disabled, so they can happen without the need
for any other sort of locking.  Assuming that the cache is not exhausted,
BPF programs will be able to safely allocate memory in any context.
<p>
When a cache is first set up, it will be populated with a maximum of four
objects of 
each size in each regular list, and one of each size in each NMI list (for
each CPU, of course).  Whenever a object is allocated from a list, though,
the number of available items is compared against a low watermark, which
is 32 objects; if it is below that value, the <tt>irq_work</tt> mechanism
is used to call a function to expand the list to 64&nbsp;items.  On
non-realtime kernels, this work will happen in a kernel thread, where
memory allocations are relatively unconstrained.
<p>
Similarly, whenever an object is returned to the BPF allocator, the length
of the list is compared against the high watermark (96 items); if the list
is too long, some objects will be returned to the kernel
to bring the number of items down to&nbsp;64.  This prevents a cache from
accumulating too many objects; it also deals with imbalances that may
result if objects are allocated on one CPU and released on a different one.

<p>
<h4>Memory use</h4>
<p>
It is worth noting that these caches are not global objects; they are
allocated independently for each user.  For example, one cache is
established for every hash map used by BPF programs, of which there could
be many.  It is thus natural to wonder about just how much memory might be
consumed by these caches in a busy system.  The behavior described above is
clearly intended to make memory available for ready allocation while
limiting the total amount of memory that sits in the cache itself.  It is
logical to expect that most users will not allocate objects of every
available size on every available CPU, and most of them will never run in
response to an NMI.  Keeping hundreds of objects around just in case
something like that does happen would be wasteful, so the BPF memory caches
start with a minimal number of objects and each list will only be filled
when actual allocations occur from that list.
<p>
Still, it seems reasonable to worry that these caches could grow to consume
an excessive amount of memory, especially if there are a lot of them.
Cache allocations are counted against the memory control-group limit, if
one is in place, but there is no other limit on the memory that can be
dedicated to BPF caches.  There is no shrinker mechanism that could reduce
the size 
of the caches should the kernel find itself in need of memory
elsewhere, and there is no accounting to show how many of these caches
exist or how much memory is currently allocated to them.
<p>
The only user of this mechanism added by this patch set is the hash-map
implementation; it uses the fixed-size option.  The existence of the
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>-style option, though, suggests that there are other
near-term users in mind.
<p>
In response to the posting, Christoph Hellwig <a
href="/ml/bpf/YrlWLLDdvDlH0C6J@infradead.org/">suggested</a> that
Starovoitov talk with the maintainers of the existing slab allocators
before proceeding.  There have been few responses from the
memory-management developers to patch series thus far, though, so it is not
clear what their thoughts on the matter are.  This new allocator is
entirely contained within the BPF code and does not touch the
memory-management subsystem, so it could, in principle, proceed without
their involvement. 
That said, the memory-management developers have some expertise in this
area and are likely to have some useful thoughts on how this problem should
be solved.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

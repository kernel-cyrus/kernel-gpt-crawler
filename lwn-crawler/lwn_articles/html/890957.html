           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>April 12, 2022</br>

<p>
When last we <a href="/Articles/832959/">looked</a> in on the proposed
<tt>trusted_for()</tt> system call, which would allow user-space interpreters
and other tools to ask the kernel whether a file is "trusted" for execution, it
looked like it was on-track for the mainline.  That was back in
October&nbsp;2020; the patch has been updated multiple times since then,
made its way into linux-next, and a <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220321161557.495388-1-mic@digikod.net/">pull
request</a> was made by Mickaël Salaün for the&nbsp;5.18 merge window.  But
it seems that there will be more to the story of getting this functionality
into the kernel, as Linus Torvalds declined to pull <tt>trusted_for()</tt>,
at least partly because he did not like the name, but there were other
reasons as well.  While he is not opposed
to the functionality it would provide, he also had strong feelings that a
new system call
was not the right approach.
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
The patch has been through 18 versions since it was first <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20181212081712.32347-1-mic%40digikod.net/">introduced</a>
in 2018.  It <a href="/Articles/820000/">started out</a> as a new flag
(<tt>O_MAYEXEC</tt>) for the <a 
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html"><tt>openat2()</tt></a>
system call.  The idea behind it is fairly straightforward: the kernel enforces a
number of security checks on files before they can be executed, but various
kinds of tools can simply read files in order to execute them.
Those files are not subject to the same checks, since the kernel is unaware
that they contain code to be executed; finding a way to apply the same
checks to files that are, effectively, being opened for execution, is the
goal of Salaün's work.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, user space needs to be involved since the kernel cannot know
that any file being opened is going to be used that way—the vast majority
of files are not, after all. Python and other tools are interested in
supporting security checks for files containing code
(see <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0578/">PEP&nbsp;578</a>, for
example), but there will clearly be a long tail of tools needing to inform
the kernel of their intention and some may well resist or be uninterested in doing so. 
There would be value in having the feature for some types of locked-down
systems that only have "well-behaved" tools that make the check.
</p>

<p>
Along the way, Al Viro, maintainer of the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer,
<a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200810230521.GG1236603%40ZenIV.linux.org.uk/">complained</a>
that <tt>openat2()</tt> was not the proper place for handling this kind of
check.  He suggested a new system call, instead.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200908075956.1069018-1-mic%40digikod.net/">next
version of the patches</a> moved to an <tt>AT_INTERPRETED</tt> flag for the
<a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/faccessat.2.html"><tt>faccessat2()</tt></a>
system call instead, but Viro <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200909171316.GW1236603@ZenIV.linux.org.uk/">thought</a>
that was not any better and again suggested a new system call.
</p>

<p>
After a round of bikeshedding about the name, Salaün <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200924153228.387737-1-mic@digikod.net/">decided</a>
on <tt>trusted_for()</tt>.  The subsequent revisions were mostly cosmetic
changes or updating the code for more recent kernels. It looks nearly the
same as it did
in our article a year and a half ago:
<pre>
    int trusted_for(const int fd, const int usage, const unsigned int flags);
</pre>		    
</p>

<p>
The call will check the file indicated by <tt>fd</tt> to see if it is
allowed for the <tt>usage</tt> (<tt>TRUSTED_FOR_EXECUTION</tt> is
the only option currently defined); <tt>flags</tt> is, as yet, unused. It
will return zero if the file is trusted or <tt>EACCESS</tt> if it is not.
By default, however, <tt>trusted_for()</tt> does not actually do anything,
but there is a new <tt>fs.trusted_for_policy</tt> sysctl knob that can be
set to have it check for files on a filesystem mounted with
<tt>noexec</tt>, files that do not have execute permission, or
both.
</p>

<h4>No merge</h4>

<p>
After the 5.18 merge window had closed without <tt>trusted_for()</tt> being
pulled, both <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/f6cf4112-b7b9-7ad7-dbb0-27304176146f@digikod.net/">Salaün</a>
and <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/202204041130.F649632@keescook/">Kees Cook</a>
asked about the status.  It turns out that Torvalds <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgoC76v-4s0xVr1Xvnx-8xZ8M+LWgyq5qGLA5UBimEXtQ@mail.gmail.com/">was
not happy</a> to see a new, non-standard system call with a
"<q>completely random interface with no semantics except 
for random 'future flags'</q>".
Salaün <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/816667d8-2a6c-6334-94a4-6127699d4144@digikod.net/">disagreed</a>
that the semantics 
were unspecified; "<q>I think the semantic is well defined:
'This new syscall enables user space to ask the kernel: is this file
descriptor's content trusted to be used for this purpose?'</q>"
</p>

<p>
Torvalds had a few other complaints as well:
<blockquote class="bq">
What the system call seems to actually *want* is basically a new flag
to access() (and faccessat()). One that is very close to what X_OK
already is.
<p>
[...] No way will this ever get merged, and whoever came up with that
disgusting "trusted_for()" (for WHAT? WHO TRUSTS? WHY?) should look
themselves in the mirror.
<p>
If you add a new X_OK variant to access(), maybe that could fly.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The <tt>X_OK</tt> flag for <tt>access()</tt> (and <tt>faccessat2()</tt>) is
used to determine whether 
the process has permission to execute a given file, using the real user and group IDs
(rather than the effective IDs, which could be different for set-user-ID
programs).  For <tt>faccessat2()</tt>, the <tt>AT_EACCESS</tt> flag can be
used to check the effective IDs instead. As Salaün noted, though, 
Torvalds's suggestion was similar to what Salaün had earlier done with
<tt>AT_INTERPRETED</tt> for <tt>faccessat2()</tt>; he is willing to go back
to that mechanism and wondered if Torvalds
liked that approach better.  
</p>

<p>
Torvalds looked at the earlier patch, which he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjPuRi5uYs9SuQ2Xn+8+RnhoKgjPEwNm42+AGKDrjTU5g@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
was a more reasonable approach, though he had some specific questions and
suggestions.  He wondered why a new mode bit,
perhaps called <tt>EXECVE_OK</tt>, could not be used instead of adding the
new <tt>AT_INTERPRETED</tt> flag value.  That way it could
be used for both <tt>access()</tt>, which lacks a flags parameter, and for
<tt>faccessat2()</tt>; that makes more sense given what is being checked.
The currently defined mode bits for those system calls check for read,
write, or execute access. 
</p>

<p>
Salaün <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1eeae491-7f4f-2cbc-7dbb-04e926c78b89@digikod.net/">agreed</a>
that using a mode bit was a better choice.  Some of the other oddities that
Torvalds noted in the patch were due to it being an early version of the
feature on a path that was quickly abandoned after Viro's objection.
Salaün plans to update the patch and resubmit, though one might guess Viro
will still have the same objections, so how far it all goes is not clear.
In addition, if further checks are added, such as for Linux security module
(LSM) access restrictions or file-integrity verification, it may be done by way of additional bits on
<tt>fs.trusted_for_policy</tt> (with a new name), but it will require
additional code for <tt>access()</tt>/<tt>faccessat2()</tt> to actually
perform the checks.
</p>

<h4>Bikeshed history</h4>

<p>
Ted Ts'o <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/YkxYHqLqTEKFrCeg@mit.edu/">suggested</a>
that the history of the evolution of the feature would be a good addition to
the changelog:
<blockquote class="bq">
As a suggestion, something that can be helpful for something which has
been as heavily bike-sheded as this concept might be to write a
"legislative history", or perhaps, a "bike shed history".
<p>
And not just with links to mailing list discussions, but a short
summary of why, for example, we moved from the open flag O_MAYEXEC to
the faccessat(2) approach.  I looked, but I couldn't find the
reasoning while diving into the mail archives. [...]
<p>
It might be that when all of this is laid out, we can either revisit
prior design decisions as "that bike-shed request to support this
corner case was unreasonable", or "oh, OK, this is why we need as
fully general a solution as this".
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Some of that information is contained in the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220104155024.48023-3-mic@digikod.net/">patch</a>
that actually adds the system call, though it mostly just lists the changes
for each version without a lot of explanation of the sort Ts'o is looking
for.  This article and the earlier two may also help fill in some of those holes.
</p>

<p>
Overall, it is a fairly simple feature that could provide some useful
functionality in specialized environments.  But where it actually will live
has been rather difficult to resolve.  Given Torvalds's preference,
returning to the plan for putting it in <tt>access()</tt> and
<tt>faccessat2()</tt> looks like it has a plausible future, but we will
have to see how version&nbsp;19 (and beyond) of the patch set fare.

Is there a reason why interpreters can&#x27;t just fstat() a file descriptor, and check whether the file has executable permission before running it?<br>
<p>
I also feel like this functionality is overly focused - the whole &quot;how can a program tell if a script should be interpreted&quot; seems like something file metadata would be better suited for (or some central database).<br>
<p>
As an example, on Windows both Chrome and Firefox store the &quot;origin&quot; of downloaded files as part of a file&#x27;s metadata. Then, if a user attempts to execute such a file, the operating system displays an &quot;are you sure you want to execute this?&quot; prompt to the user. Putting aside whether that *particular* mechanism is worthwhile, the general idea seems close to what trusted_for is supposed to do.<br>

The kernel does more checks than just the execute flag. Just to name one, the filesystem may be mounted with noexec.<br>
<p>
There are others, there may be more in the future, and handling all the checks in one spot—the kernel—makes more sense than duplicating it across a dozen potentially buggy interpreters. <br>

This trivially leads to a Time-Of-Check, Time-Of-Use race condition since it&#x27;s not a property of the FD but instead of the entry on the file system that has the execute permission.<br>

A file descriptor *does* do that, sort of. It&#x27;s just that the permissions it keeps track of are O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, etc., rather than S_IRUSR etc. (i.e. it keeps track of what you asked to do when you called open(2), not what stat(2) or access(2) would have told you). That&#x27;s probably why the first version of this patch was attempting to add a flag to open(2).<br>

Ultimately this idea looks much like forcing policy into kernel space.<br>
<p>
Kernel doesn&#x27;t decided if the interpreter can run the script (the interpreter does, meaning the interpreter could be written to ignore the syscall). Further more the kernel doesn&#x27;t actually know answer the the question with it&#x27;s resources. It *could* tell you if the file is executable or not. However if that&#x27;s what you want, there&#x27;s an easy solution: make the interpreter only work as an interpreter (and/or use access(X_OK)). Those are the things the kernel knows about or has control over.<br>

I recall an important use case for this was to integrate well with things like selinux and IMA. In those cases, the kernel would be responsible for security policy and verifying signatures or hashes for executables already. However, for interpreters that causes issues, as the kernel has no way of knowing whether a file is being opened for regular reading or execution, as only the latter should require special verification from the kernel.<br>

The kernel is already responsible for making the policy decision &quot;is it ok to execute this ELF binary&quot;. This is just letting you reuse that same policy machinery for interpreters.<br>
<p>
It helps to remember that this is mostly useful for systems with fancy security hardening, e.g. ones where all executables have to be signed with a trusted key, as a way to make life difficult for attackers. This feature should make it possible for that kind of system to e.g. ship a regular python interpreter, without breaking the security hardening.<br>

      How is access() or faccessat2() supposed to be used safely? Is there a way to avoid the TOCTOU that is mentioned in the man page?

<blockquote>
       Warning: Using these calls to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file  to  manipulate  it.
       For this reason, the use of this system call should be avoided.  (In the example just described, a safer alternative would be to temporarily switch the process's effective user ID to the real ID and then call open(2).)

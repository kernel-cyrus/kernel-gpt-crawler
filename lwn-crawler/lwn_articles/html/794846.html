<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>July 31, 2019</br>
           </div>
<p>
It has been the better part of a decade since the last <a
href="/Articles/425583/">KernelShark article</a> appeared here; in the
interim, the kernel-tracing visualization tool has undergone some major changes.
While the high-level appearance is largely similar, the underlying code
has switched from GTK+&nbsp;2.0 to Qt&nbsp;5.  On July&nbsp;26,
maintainer Steven Rostedt <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190726095730.0674d81d@gandalf.local.home/">announced</a>
the release of KernelShark version&nbsp;1.0, which makes it a good time to
take another peek.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.kernelshark.org/">KernelShark</a> is a
graphical interface to help track down 
information in the voluminous kernel traces that <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd.1.html"><tt>trace-cmd</tt></a>
can produce.  <tt>trace-cmd</tt> is a front end for the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt">ftrace
kernel tracer</a>.  Rostedt wrote about <a
href="/Articles/410200/"><tt>trace-cmd</tt></a> and ftrace (<a
href="/Articles/365835/">part 1</a> and <a
href="/Articles/366796/">part 2</a>) for LWN nearly a decade ago as well.
Ftrace 
can collect an enormous amount of information from within a running kernel;
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> simply makes it much easier for users to configure and manage
those traces.  KernelShark adds yet another level of capabilities.
</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="/Articles/794932/">
<img class="photo" src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/kshark1-sm.png" alt="[KernelShark]"
title="KernelShark">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
As can be seen in the screen shot from a lightly loaded system (click
through for a full-resolution view), KernelShark
maintains its overall look, 
with two main panes to display the data it found in <tt>trace.dat</tt> (by
default); <tt>trace.dat</tt> is the name of the default
<tt>trace-cmd</tt> output file. 
The top gives a graphical view of the trace events that were gathered,
organized by CPU, at least by default.  Each horizontal bar indicates the
activity on a 
particular CPU; that activity is 
color-coded based on the task running.  Full-height indicators on the bar
denote an event captured, while half-height indicators just show that the
task is running;  a bare line shows idle time.
</p>

<p>
The graphical display can show task bars instead of, or in addition to, the
CPU bars. The task bars show the events only for tasks of interest, which
are chosen from the "Tasks" entry in the "Plots" menu. The
display shows a segment of the time covered by the trace; 
initially, it shows the entire duration, with start and end times at either
end.  But one can zoom in on the trace, reducing the amount of time shown
and increasing the granularity of the view (the screen shot below is zoomed
in from the one above).  That will allow users to find
and focus on places of interest in the trace.
</p>

<p>
Zooming can be accomplished a number of different ways.  There are buttons
directly above the graphical pane; "+" and "-" increase and decrease the
zoom factor, while "++" and "--" zoom all the way in or out.  The mouse
scroll wheel can also be used to zoom in and out.  One note: if there are
more horizontal bars 
than the graphical pane can show, so that there is a scroll bar for the pane, it
can be a little unexpected to get the zoom function rather than the expected
scroll behavior.  Scrolling requires using the scroll bar (or increasing
the size 
of the pane or KernelShark window to eliminate the need).  Yet another
mechanism to zoom in is to click and drag within the graphical view, which
outlines a rectangle that will define the region of interest; when the
mouse is released it zooms in to show that region.

<p>
The second main pane is the list pane, which shows the events that were
recorded in the trace.  For each event, there is an index number for the
event's position in the trace, the CPU on which it was recorded, a
timestamp, the name of the task and its process ID, some flags (interrupts
disable, need reschedule, etc.), the event name, and the output from the
event.  Above the list pane is a search interface that can be used to
search any of the columns, as well as a "Graph follows" checkbox, which
governs the action in the graphical pane when a particular list entry is
selected. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="/Articles/794933/">
<img class="photo" src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/kshark2-sm.png"
alt="[KernelShark zoomed in]"
title="KernelShark zoomed in">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
If "Graph follows" is checked (which is the default), then a marker
(vertical line) is placed in the graphical view where an event that was
selected in the list view occurs.  Users can see what else is going on
around that time at various timescales by zooming in and panning (using the
arrow keys).  There are two markers available (A and B); they can be set
from either the list view or the graphical view.  Double-clicking in the
graphical view will set the marker (whichever has its button highlighted
above the view), but it is being set on an "nearby" event, so the
double-click must be close to an event or the marker will not be placed
anywhere.  Placing the marker will highlight the event in question in the 
list view as well.
</p>

<p>
Each marker has a timestamp associated with it (i.e. the same as the
timestamp on the event it refers to) that is listed with the buttons above
the graphical view.  If both markers are set, the difference between their
timestamps is also displayed there to 100ns precision.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple filtering capabilities available from the "Filter"
menu. Tasks, events, and CPUs can be removed (or added back in) from the
graphical view, list 
view, or both.  The advanced filtering can do even more, allowing access to
the filtering mechanisms provided by <tt>trace-cmd</tt>/ftrace.  Filters
can also be saved in order to reuse them later.
</p>

<p>
KernelShark saves its current state when it exits and restores
the state of that session when it is restarted.  Beyond that, sessions can
be saved at any time and then, naturally, can be loaded when they are
needed.  
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://kernelshark.org/Documentation.html">KernelShark
documentation</a> is rather terse, but covers most everything needed.  The
"Tools" menu has some entries that could use some explanation (e.g. on
plugins, the seemingly non-functional color-scheme slider, and the "Record"
option), however.  The short <a
href="http://www.kernelshark.org/build.html">build instructions</a>
provided everything needed to build KernelShark on a Fedora system; there
is dependency information for Ubuntu as well.
</p>

<p>
KernelShark currently lives in the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/trace-cmd.git"><tt>trace-cmd</tt>
repository</a>, though that will change eventually.  In the announcement,
Rostedt noted that he will be transitioning the maintainership of
KernelShark to Yordan Karadzhov; they will be sharing the maintainer duties for
a while.  As part of that transition, KernelShark will be moving to its own
repository. 
</p>

<p>
For those digging into kernel traces, KernelShark looks to be an excellent
tool to help find whatever problem they are investigating.  It would seem
that the KernelShark team is not resting on its laurels, either, as Rostedt
specifically mentions getting started on work toward KernelShark&nbsp;2.0.
No roadmap seems to be available for that, but one would guess that user
suggestions (and, better still, code) would be welcome at this point.

I assume the reason to move to Qt is more surface area covered, and better portability.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure why to switch to GTK, othe than maybe as part of intgrating more tightly with gnome, which seems unnecsesary for most apps that aren't trying to be part of the desktop itself.<br>

But maybe I'm ill-informed.<br>

The old version was written in GTK 2, and that was part of the reason it became stale. GTK 3 was going to be a lot of work to convert to. When Yordan Karadzhov joined my team, I wanted him to rewrite it from scratch (I made a lot of design mistakes in the first version, and wanted to correct them). Yordan had a strong background in Qt (not so much in GTK) and since I didn't want to have to have it rewritten when GTK 4 comes around, I let him rewrite it in Qt. He also did it in C++ (the original was plan C).<br>
<p>
We wanted to release 1.0 when it had all the capabilities of the GTK version. We accomplished that, and along the way also added new features. (The best being the save and restoring of sessions)<br>

Yes porting from GTK 2 to GTK 3 is quite painful. For simple apps the GTK 3 to GTK 4 port is promised to be easier (but it remains to be seen), but it's much more difficult when there are custom widgets (with custom drawing etc).<br>
<p>
GTK also removes features, for example with GTK 3 it is not possible to easily create a traditional UI with a menubar + toolbar without using deprecated APIs (with all those deprecated APIs being removed in GTK 4, of course). My understanding is that GTK developers/designers want all apps to have the new headerbar with its "hamburger" menu as UI, but for big applications containing a big menu this is not suitable IMHO (and there are other reasons to believe that it's not suitable even for small desktop apps).<br>
<p>
I've heard that porting to new major versions of Qt is much simpler.<br>

There's really no compelling reason to port anything (other than crusty old win32 apps) to GTK any more. If you're resource-constrained or need C FFI, EFL is better bang for the buck. For everything else, Qt is explicitly cross-platform and less antagonistic.<br>

The link is to my home server. I have <a href="http://www.kernelshark.org">http://www.kernelshark.org</a> marked with CNAME rostedt.homelinux.com, which is hosted by DynDNS, which some firewalls block (and you will get 404). Try <a href="http://kernelshark.org">http://kernelshark.org</a> (without the www) and that has the direct IP address (but can go stale if my IP changes. Luckily that only happens every couple of years).<br>

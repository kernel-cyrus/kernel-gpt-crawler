<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 30, 2018</br>
           </div>
In February, the <a href="/Articles/747551/">bpfilter mechanism</a> was
first posted to the mailing lists.  Bpfilter is meant to be a replacement
for the current in-kernel firewall/packet-filtering code.  It provides
little functionality itself; instead, it creates a set of hooks that can
run BPF programs to make the packet-filtering decisions.  <a
href="/Articles/755165/">A version of that patch set</a> has been merged
into the net-next tree for 4.18.  It will not be replacing any existing
packet filters in its current form, but it does feature a significant
change to one of its more controversial features: the new user-mode helper
mechanism.
<p>
The core motivation behind bpfilter is performance.  An in-kernel,
general-purpose packet filter must necessarily offer a wide range of
features; any given site will probably only use a small subset of those
features.  The result is a lot of unused code and time spent checking for
whether a given feature is in use, slowing the whole thing down.  A
packet-filtering configuration expressed as a BPF program, instead,
contains only the code needed to implement the desired policy.  Once that
code is translated to native code by the just-in-time compiler, it should
be both compact and fast.  The networking developers hope that it will be
fast enough to win back some of the users who have moved to proprietary
user-space filtering implementations.
<p>
If bpfilter is to replace netfilter, though, it must provide ABI
compatibility so that existing configurations continue to work.  To that
end, the bpfilter developers intend to implement the current netfilter
configuration protocol; bpfilter will accept iptables rules and compile
them to BPF transparently.  That compilation is not a trivial task, though,
and one that could present some security challenges, so the desire is to do
it in user space, but under kernel control.
<p>
To make that possible, the initial proposal included a new type of kernel
module.  Rather than containing kernel code, it contained a normal ELF
executable that would be run as a special type of kernel thread.  Using the
module mechanism allowed this code to be packaged and built with the rest
of the kernel; user-mode modules could also be subjected to the same
signing rules.  There were a number of concerns about how these modules
worked, though, which led to some significant changes this time around.
<p>
For example, the user-mode helper code is no longer packaged as a module.
It is, instead, a blob of code that is built into a normal kernel subsystem
(which may be built into the kernel image or packaged as a module).  In the
sample code, the user-mode component is built as a separate program then,
in a process involving "<q>quite a bit of objcopy and Makefile
magic</q>", it is turned into an ordinary object file that can be linked
into the <tt>bpfilter.ko</tt> kernel module.
<p>
Kernel code that wants to run a blob of code in user space will do so using
the new helper code.  That is done by calling:
<p>
<pre>
    int fork_usermode_blob(void *data, size_t len, struct umh_info *info);
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>data</tt> points to the code to be run, and <tt>len</tt> is the length
of that code in bytes.  The <tt>info</tt> structure is defined as:
<p>
<pre>
    struct umh_info {
	struct file *pipe_to_umh;
	struct file *pipe_from_umh;
	pid_t pid;
    };
</pre>
<p>
Assuming the user-space process is successfully created, the kernel will
place its process ID into <tt>pid</tt>.  The kernel will also create a pair
of pipes for communicating with the new process; they will be stored in
<tt>pipe_to_umh</tt> (for writing) and <tt>pipe_from_umh</tt> (for
reading).  The code itself is copied into a tmpfs file and executed from
there; that allows it to be paged if needed.  If the built-in copy of the
code is marked as "initdata" (and thus placed in a different section), the
caller can free it once the helper is running.
<p>
Kernel code that creates this type of helper process must take care to
clean it up when the time comes.  The process ID can be used to kill the
process, and the pipes need to be closed.
<p>
The bpfilter module itself, as found in 4.18, does not actually do much.
It creates the helper process and can pass a couple of no-op commands to
it, but there is no packet-filtering machinery in place yet.  That code
exists (and has been <a href="/Articles/753460/">posted</a> recently) but
has evidently been held back 
to give the user-mode helper mechanism a cycle to stabilize.
Bpfilter is thus starting small, but it may have a big impact in the end;
perhaps that's why Dave Miller said "<q>let the madness begin</q>" as
he <a href="/Articles/755933/">merged</a> the code for 4.18.
<p>
The
replacement of netfilter, even if it happens as expected, will take years to
play out, but we may see a number of interesting uses of the new user-mode
helper mechanism before then.  The kernel has just gained a way to easily
sandbox code that is carrying out complex tasks and which does not need to
be running in a privileged mode; it doesn't take much effort to think of
other settings where this ability could be used to isolate scary code.
Just be careful not to call the result a "microkernel" or people might get
upset.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Are you comparing to C that does what the BPF does, or C that directly interprets a custom rule language? C is not a terribly good language for writing fast interpreters, and few people write their firewall rules in C.<br>

C that does what the BPF does. Especially for a complicated firewall rule (e.g. anything that has to parse the IP option header chain), it would be a fair amount of code for each rule. Similarly, people are pushing a lot of what used to be security modules into BPF, and so on, so it'd be interesting to know approximately what the overhead is.<br>

Before I read the link I surmised that the Lindy effect was that when a large system adds a general-purpose language (in this case BPF) it will drive out less general, more specialized configuration languages (the firewall rule definitions).  The end of this process is when the extension language becomes almost the whole program (Emacs started out as a set of macros for another editor but soon turned into an editor implemented entirely in Lisp).  Does that "effect" have a name and a Wikipedia article?<br>

Yes, I had both of those rules in mind, but that's not quite the effect I was stating.  It would be a corollary to Greenspun's rule: that said buggy half-Lisp will then start to take over the rest of the program, usurping first the other configuration languages and then the core functionality.  (Javascript in the web browser comes to mind as another example.)<br>

nftables is a bit nicer to read/maintain than iptables after it's set up, so I don't regret making the effort to switch. I'd hope they learn from history and give this iteration a more reasonable learning curve though.<br>

I read somewhere that they intend to haver nftables configuration be able to use bpfilter as a backend. In that case the learning wasn't for nothing. I also believe the nftables configuration language is far superior to iptables.<br>

There's an amount of irony in adding a mechanism for the kernel to run full blown user code to support the ability for it to be able to run restricted user code. Granted, there are some differences, but still...<br>

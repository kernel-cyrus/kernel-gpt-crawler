<p>
The stable kernel trees are quite active, often seeing several releases in
a week's time.  But they are also meant to be ... well ... stable, so a lot
of effort goes into trying to ensure that they do not introduce new bugs or
regress the kernel's functionality. One of the stable maintainers, Sasha
Levin,  gave a talk at the virtual
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/">Open
Source Summit North America</a> that described the process of ensuring that
these trees are carefully managed so that they can provide a stable base for their users.
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
The goals of the stable tree are somewhat in competition with each other, Levin said.  
The maintainers do not want to introduce regressions into the tree, but
they also want to try to ensure that they do not miss any fixes that should be
in the tree.  It is "very tricky" to balance those two goals.  The talk
would follow  the path of patches that fix bugs, from the time they are written until
they get released in a stable tree, showing the mechanisms
in place to try to ensure that only real, non-regressing fixes make it all
the way to the end.
</p>

<p>
The first stage is the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/stable-kernel-rules.html">rules</a>
for the kinds of patches that get accepted 
into the stable tree.  They have to be small, straightforward fixes that are
already upstream in Linus Torvalds's tree.  No complex new mechanisms or
new features are welcome in the stable tree.  The patches have "passed the minimal
bar" to get accepted into the mainline, but it is sometimes necessary for 
the maintainers (or
patch submitters) to backport the patch. That is something the maintainers
try hard
to avoid, so that the testing of the mainline is effectively also testing
everything in stable, but backports cannot be avoided at all times.  If there are
large, intrusive patches that must be backported—for, say, mitigations for
speculative-execution processor flaws—the stable maintainers require a lot
more testing, subsystem maintainer signoffs, and more to try to ensure that
the backport is reasonable.
</p>

<h4>Stable patch process</h4>

<p>
The stable process starts when someone is working on a patch.  If they
submit it upstream tagged for the stable tree, reviewers and maintainers
will generally pay more attention to it.  Because the patch will likely end
up in users' hands quickly, it is important to ensure that the patch is
correct.  If a patch is submitted that fixes a problem, but is not tagged
for stable, the subsystem or stable-tree maintainers may ask that it get
tagged for stable and, perhaps, get a "Fixes:" tag to help with backports.
</p>

alt="[Sasha Levin]" title="Sasha Levin" width=226 height=325>
</a>

<p>
There is a bot that grabs patches tagged for stable from mailing lists and tries to apply them
to different stable trees based on the stable versions indicated or by using
the Fixes: tag.  If the patch does not apply correctly, the bot will alert
the author to the problem and possibly offer suggestions for other patches
that may need to be applied before the fix will apply.  It is important to
do this when the patch is still being worked on, Levin said, as developers
are generally more responsive when the fix is still fresh in their minds.
</p>

<p>
"There's never a bad time to send upstream."  Unlike other types of
patches, fixes can be sent to the mailing list at any point in the
development cycle.  There is no need to wait for a merge window or to
target a
particular release candidate. "You should never sit on a fix, if you think
it is good to go", he said.

<p>
Once a patch has been reviewed and gets accepted into a maintainer's tree,
it will usually also end up in the linux-next tree, which means that it
will get hit with a bunch of tests, mostly from bots of various sorts.
Also, the <a href="https://kernelci.org/">KernelCI</a>
continuous-integration project will run its tests on various maintainer
trees.  These provide a "good first bar" for stable patches to clear.
</p>

<p>
Another testing tree, stable-next, is created by pulling the patches in the linux-next tree that
are  
tagged for stable but have not (yet) been merged into Torvalds's
tree.  The idea is that test failures in this tree are likely to be
caused by patches that are making their way into the stable trees, so it
raises the visibility of those kinds of problems. "We don't want those
failures to be swallowed up by other failures in linux-next", Levin said.
Doing so also helps find patches that are being fixed by later patches,
which are not yet upstream;  if a stable-tagged fix is actually buggy, then it can be
held out of the stable tree until its fix gets committed to the mainline.
</p>

<h4>Into the mainline</h4>

<p>
Once the patch is merged into the mainline, it will be exposed to even more
tests, many of which are being run by kernel developers rather than bots.
There is more exposure to different workloads and hardware at that point.
The stable maintainers are appreciative of all of the work that people are
doing testing the mainline as it helps make the stable trees better, he said.
</p>

<p>
If a patch in the mainline does not have a stable tag but it looks like it
may be a fix, it might get submitted to the AUTOSEL bot, which is a <a
href="/Articles/764647/">neural network for finding fixes</a>.  AUTOSEL
looks at various parts of a patch—its author, commit message, signoffs,
files changed, and certain code constructs—in order to determine if the
patch is a probable fix that is missing a stable tag.
</p>

<p>
When a patch reaches the mainline, that is when the work of the stable
maintainers truly begins, he said.  Each patch that is taken into the
stable trees is reviewed by one of the maintainers.  They look at each
patch manually to try to ensure that it is correct and that it is
appropriate for the stable kernels.  The AUTOSEL patches get an additional
week of review time in order to hopefully weed out problem patches that
were identified in that process.
When a patch is queued for stable, an email is generated to the author
informing them that it has been done so that they can object if they think
it is inappropriate or being applied to the wrong tree.
</p>

<p> The stable maintainers try to avoid modifying patches that do not
cleanly apply to a particular tree. Levin pointed to his <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sashal/deps.git/">dependency-chain
Git repository</a> as a way to find a set of patches that will allow the
unmodified fix to be merged.  "We would rather take a few more
patches to make a certain patch apply and build and test cleanly rather
than modifying the patch", he said.  Looking at the dependency chain will
also often help find other fixes that did not get tagged for stable.  </p>

<p>
Once a patch makes it into the queue for a stable release, it will get
tested again by many of the same bots that test linux-next.  These trees
are generated frequently with new patches added, so any testing failures
will often point to the latest patches that were added.  Compared to
linux-next, the stable queue trees have far fewer patches, so it is easier
to sanity check them for missing patches, regressions, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice a week, release candidates are tagged.  That will generate
"yet another mail" informing developers that their patches have made it
into a stable release candidate.  It gives developers another chance to
object or comment on the patch with respect to the stable trees.  The
release candidates are also tested with real workloads, Levin said; users
of the stable trees test them in their data centers and in their test
farms.  The tests are more comprehensive than those typically done for
mainline release candidates, since they involve the "actual end users" of
the trees, he said.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who is concerned about regressions from the
stable kernels is encouraged to get involved in this process by testing
their own workloads with these kernels.  The stable maintainers do not want
to release kernels with regressions, so they want to hear about any problems from
users.  The process is fairly "free form", he said, so that companies who
do not want to talk about their workloads publicly can still report
problems they encounter privately to the stable maintainers.  They will
make every effort to address any problems found before any release so that regressions are
minimized or eliminated.
</p>

<h4>Aftermath</h4>

<p>
Once the stable kernel is released, there is still more that the
maintainers do.  They monitor the mailing lists for fixes and bug reports
that may impact patches added to the stable kernels.  When those are found,
the maintainers move quickly to get them into the next stable release in
order to reduce the amount of time any regressions or bugs stay in the stable kernels.
</p>

<p>
One of the goals of the stable maintainers is to improve the testing and
validation strategy for the kernel as a whole, Levin said.  There is a
belief that the stable kernels should only get a small number of changes
"because it's stable".  But if that were the case, it would mean that the
tree is missing lots of important fixes.  The way to address the problem is
not by taking fewer patches, but
"by beefing up the kernel's testing story".  The maintainers work with projects like
KernelCI and the  <a
href="https://01.org/lkp/documentation/0-day-test-service">0-Day testing
service</a> to help ensure that they are working well and have the
resources that they need.
</p>

<p>
Monitoring the downstream trees, like the kernel trees for Ubuntu and
Fedora, is also something that the stable maintainers do.  If a patch is in
a distribution's kernel but is not in the upstream kernel, maybe it should
be, especially if it fixes something.  Similarly, they monitor the bug
trackers of various vendors and distributions to spot fixes that may need
to be added to the stable kernels.  Recently, they have been looking at the
older stable kernels to see if there are fixes that have been missed for
them along the way; when those are found, they get added into those older
stable trees.
</p>

<p> The stable kernel process has a lot of safeguards in place to try to
ensure that regressions are not introduced into those kernels.  The stable
kernels are "way better tested" than the mainline because they are seeing
actual real workloads, rather than "just developers trying it on their
laptops".  The <a href="/Articles/812231/">rate of regressions</a> is low,
especially when compared with the mainline, he said.  So people should feel
confident to take each new stable kernel as it is released; in addition,
there will never be fixes in older stable kernels that are not also in the
newer stable kernels, so upgrading to a newer stable series will not
introduce regressions—from the stable process, at least.  </p>

</a>

<p>
At the end of the talk, a somewhat differently dressed Levin appeared to
answer questions that were submitted through the chat-like interface in the
conference system.  One asked about cooperation between the stable
maintainers and projects like the <a
href="https://www.cip-project.org/">Civil Infrastructure Platform</a>,
which are maintaining kernels for longer time frames.  Levin said there are
patches flowing in both directions between the groups and that
there is a lot of cooperation around KernelCI and other testing
initiatives. In answer to another question, Levin said that he hoped that
failure reproducers from <a
href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot.md">syzbot</a> fuzz
testing could be added as part of testing for the stable tree at some
point.  He also acknowledged
that a "not for stable" tag might be needed in the future, though currently
that is handled by a note in the commit message to that effect—hopefully along with
the reason why.
</p>

<p>
While the talk was interesting, it was still vaguely unsatisfying—virtual
conferences unsurprisingly do not live up to their in-person counterparts.
But that is the way of things for a while, at least, and perhaps beyond
even the end of the pandemic.  The carbon footprint of such gatherings is
certainly of some concern.  In any case, the stable kernel process seems to
be in good shape these days, with attentive maintainers, lots of testing,
and plenty of fixes to get into the hands of users.  Levin's talk was
definitely a welcome look inside.

In contemporary Fedora kernels (starting with later 5.6.x kernels into the 5.7.x series), there have been at least two significant regressions I&#x27;ve seen users report in the #fedora channel on the Freenode IRC network.  Luckily I&#x27;ve not run into either on the hardware I use.  One regresion is with the Intel i915 video driver (<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1854167">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1854167</a>) and another on a particular family of wifi chipsets that I don&#x27;t recall the make and model of.  In both cases they are devices that had long been working in previous kernels and stopped working.  I believe in the wifi case there was a kernel mailing list discussion showing they were aware of the patch that introduced the problem but since that patch fixed something else, they didn&#x27;t want to just revert it... so it was a trade-one-bug-for-another patch .  Sorry to be so vague with details but it is early and I&#x27;m not on the machine with the IRC logs to look at.  Anyhoo... the point is that regressions still seem to be fairly common... and lingering for periods of time.  If the regressions were on hardware I owned, I&#x27;d be a lot more active with them.  The bugzilla link I gave only has the initial reporter&#x27;s info so while it may appear to be limited in its impact, I know I saw at least three other people with the same breakage... and the work-around in the bug report didn&#x27;t work for them... but unfortunately they didn&#x27;t chime in with me-toos in the bug report to get it more attention.  I know, I know... anecdotal.<br>

I believe the WiFi bug you are referring to may be the one that affected the Intel 3168 family of devices. Or perhaps it was another one...<br>
<p>
In any event, I recall I had been running the last few 5.5-rc kernels on my hardware and everything was working fine. Then when 5.5.0 came out, suddenly the WiFi didn&#x27;t work at all. Within just a few hours of 5.5.0 dropping, I had a patch submitted to the linux-wireless mailing list. But it still took several weeks before the patch found its way into the mainline and subsequently was admitted into stable. So there were a number of 5.5.x releases that had this regression in them.<br>
<p>
I felt like it took too long to get that patched for 5.5.x users. While I&#x27;m quite sure it doesn&#x27;t *always* take that long to get patches integrated into stable, if avoiding regressions is highly desirable, then getting patches quickly when they *do* occur should be highly desirable, as well.<br>
<p>
Seems like we could improve processes around admitting patches for regressions, especially very obvious ones like an entire family of devices that quit working altogether. But, I&#x27;m not really heavily involved in the community, so don&#x27;t have any specific recommendations of how to do that, only my one anecdote that tells me there seems to be some room for improvement.<br>
<p>
(I&#x27;m entirely open to the possibility that there already is some way to expedite patches like this, and that in my case because I simply wasn&#x27;t aware of it, and because I didn&#x27;t use the right &quot;channels&quot;, it took longer than it might have otherwise).<br>

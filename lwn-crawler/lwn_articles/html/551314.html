Once upon a time, usable tracing tools for Linux were few and far between.
Now, instead, there is a wealth of choices, including the in-kernel ftrace
facility, SystemTap, and the LTTng suite; Oracle also has <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/entry/announcement_dtrace_for_oracle_linux">a
port of DTrace</a> for its distribution, available to its paying customers.
On May&nbsp;21, another alternative showed up in the form of the <a
href="/Articles/551253/">ktap 0.1 release</a>.  Ktap does not offer any
major features that are not available from the other tracing tools, but
there may still be a place for it in the tracing ecosystem.
<p>
Ktap appears to be strongly oriented toward the needs of embedded users;
that has affected a number of the design decisions that have been made.  At
the top of the list was the decision to embed a byte-code interpreter into
the kernel and compile tracing scripts for that interpreter.  That is a big
difference from SystemTap, which, in its current implementation, compiles a
tracing script into a separate 
module that must be loaded into the kernel.  This difference matters
because an embedded target often will not have a full compiler toolchain
installed on it; even if the tools are available, compiling and linking a
module can be a slow process.  Compiling a ktap script, instead, requires a
simple utility to produce byte code for the ktap kernel module.
<p>
That compiler implements a language that is based on <a
href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>.  It is C-like, but it is dynamically
typed, has a dictionary-like "table" type, and lacks arrays and pointers.
There is a simple function definition mechanism which can be used like
this: 
<p>
<pre>
    function eventfun (e) {
	printf("%d %d\t%s\t%s", cpu(), pid(), execname(), e.tostring())
    }
</pre>
<p>
The resulting function will, when called,  output the current CPU number,
process ID, executing program name, and 
the string representation of the passed-in event&nbsp;<tt>e</tt>.  There is a
probe-placement function, so ktap could arrange to call the above function
on system call entry with:
<p>
<pre>
    kdebug.probe("tp:syscalls", eventfun)
</pre>
<p>
A quick run on your editor's system produced a bunch of output like:
<p>
<pre>
    3 2745	Xorg	sys_setitimer(which: 0, value: 7fff05967ec0, ovalue: 0)
    3 2745	Xorg	sys_setitimer -&gt; 0x0
    2 27467	as	sys_mmap(addr: 0, len: 81000, prot: 3, flags: 22, fd: ffffffff, off: 0)
    2 27467	as	sys_mmap -&gt; 0x2aaaab67c000
    2 3402	gnome-shell	sys_mmap(addr: 0, len: 97b, prot: 1, flags: 2, fd: 21, off: 0)
    2 3402	gnome-shell	sys_mmap -&gt; 0x7f4ec4bfb000
</pre>
<p>
There are various utility functions for generating timer requests, creating
histograms, and so on.  So, for example, this script:
<p>
<pre>
    hist = {}

    function eventfun (e) {
	if (e.sc_is_enter) {
	    inplace_inc(hist, e.name)
	}
    }

    kdebug.probe("tp:syscalls", eventfun)

    kdebug.probe_end(function () {
	histogram(hist)
    })
</pre>
<p>

is sufficient to generate a histogram of system calls over the period of
time from when it starts until when the user interrupts it.  Your editor
ran it with a kernel build running and got output looking like this:
<p>
<pre>

<p>
The syntax for setting probe points closely matches that used by perf; probes
can be set on specific functions or tracepoints, for example.  It is 
possible to hook into the perf events mechanism to get other types of
hardware or software events, and memory breakpoints are supported.  The
(sparse) documentation packaged with the code also suggests that ktap is
able to set user-space 
probes, but none of the example scripts packaged with the tool demonstrate
that capability.
<p>
Ktap scripts can manipulate the return value of probed functions within the
kernel.  There does not currently appear to be a way to manipulate
kernel-space data directly, but that could presumably be added (along with
lots of other features) in the future.  What's there now is a proof of
concept as much as anything; it is a quick way to get some data out of the
kernel but does not offer a whole lot that is not available using the
existing ftrace interface.  
<p>
For those who want to play with it, the first step is a simple:
<p>
<pre>
    git clone https://github.com/ktap/ktap.git
</pre>
<p>
From there, building the code and running the sample scripts is a matter of
a few minutes of relatively painless work.  There is the <tt>ktapvm</tt>
module, which must, naturally, be loaded into the kernel.  That module
creates a special virtual file (<tt>ktap/ktapvm</tt> under the debugfs
root) that is used by the <tt>ktap</tt> binary to load and run compiled
scripts. 
<p>
Ktap in its current form is limited, without a lot of exciting new
functionality.  Even so, it seems to have generated a certain amount of
interest in the development community.  Getting started with most tracing
tools usually seems to involve a fair amount of up-front learning; ktap,
perhaps, is a more approachable solution for a number of users.  The whole
thing is about 10,000 lines of code; it shouldn't be hard for others to run
with and extend.  If developers start to take the bait, interesting things
could happen with this project.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I note that, unlike DTrace, the ktap language implements loops, which were intentionally left out of D (the DTrace language) because as soon as your language has loops and conditionals you cannot prove that execution will terminate in the general case without slamming into the halting problem, and that also constrains proof of all sorts of other properties about the code, since an awful lot of them reduce to the halting problem again. The most you can do in a constrained environment like the kernel is to impose a timeout on script execution.<br>
<p>
Of course, in a privileged tracer there are lots of other ways to cause trouble inside the kernel, and there is not yet any DTrace port for Linux which implements unprivileged tracing -- but at least unprivileged tracing is implementable there. I don't see how it could be implemented in ktap without a crude timeout or something of that ilk. Nonetheless, ktap looks very interesting and I am cheering from the sidelines, since a bytecode interpreter is much more elegant than the module-compilation approach taken by SystemTap.<br>
<p>
(one note: DTrace for Linux is available to everyone, not just paying customers, though you do need to use the UEK2 kernel. The source for the userspace component I work on is not available, though :( )<br>

      From what I can tell, ktap's loops are limited to bounded integer iteration (a Fortran "DO" loop, essentially) or iterating over a table.  So, while the execution time could be unacceptably high, everything <i>should</i> terminate.

As long as the integer iteration and table iteration don't contain a way for the current loop value to be changed during the loop, that should be OK. I wonder what happens if you change a table while iterating over it... you *can* make that have defined, consistent, and always-terminating behaviour (I did it in a C hash table once) but it tends to lead to rather complex iterators which I doubt have been implemented here. (In my case, about 40% of the code of the iterator was to deal with the stable-iteration-over-mutation case.)<br>

I looked into the ktap code, it's interesting to see how much of the Lua VM and seeminly its table implementation is there.<br>
<p>
So if it's like Lua's tables, then you can delete key-value pairs during iteration fine, but you shouldn't add key-value pairs during iteration; if you do, I think iteration is unpredictable.<br>
<p>
I think it's a bit misleading that no notice is given in the license header of the files with copies of lua code (even if lua authors are credited elsewhere). It becomes misleading when the file lists 'Author:' without declaring all of them.<br>

<h1>More fun with file descriptors</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted June 12, 2007 by corbet]
               <p>
               </div>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
In <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/236843/">last week's episode</a>, the
kernel developers were considering the addition of a couple of flags to the
<tt>open()</tt> system call; these flags would allow applications to select
previously unavailable features like the non-sequential file descriptor
range or immediate close-on-exec behavior.  The problem that comes up
quickly is that <tt>open()</tt> is just one of many system calls which
creates file descriptors; most of the others do not have a parameter which
allows an application to pass a set of accompanying flags.  So it is not
possible to request, for example, the non-sequential behavior when
obtaining a file descriptor with <tt>socket()</tt>, <tt>pipe()</tt>,
<tt>epoll_create()</tt>, <tt>timerfd()</tt>, <tt>signalfd()</tt>,
<tt>accept()</tt>, and so on.
<p>

In <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/237301/">the second version of the
non-sequential file descriptor patch</a>, Davide Libenzi attempted to
address part of the problem by adding <a href="/Articles/237727/">a
<tt>socket2()</tt> system call</a> with an added "flags" parameter.  That
was enough to frighten a number of developers; nobody really wants to see a
big expansion of the system call list resulting from the addition of
variations on all the file-descriptor-creating calls.  Another approach, it
seems, is required, but finding that approach is not entirely easy.
<p>

One possibility is to simply ignore the problem; not everybody is sold on
the need for non-sequential file descriptors or immediate close-on-exec
behavior.  There are enough people who see a problem here to motivate some
sort of solution, though.  Ulrich Drepper, the glibc maintainer, has seen
enough applications to conclude that the issue is real.
<p>


An alternative, <a href="/Articles/237731/">suggested</a> by Alan Cox, is
to create a process state flag which controls the use of these features.
So a call like:
<p>
<pre>
    prctl(PR_SPARSEFD, 1);
</pre>
<p>
would turn on non-sequential file descriptor allocation for all system
calls made by the calling process.  The problem here is that the
lowest-available-descriptor behavior is a documented part of the POSIX
binary interface.  A process could waive that guarantee for itself, but it
will always be hard to know that all libraries used by that process are
safe in the absence of that behavior.  One library might want to use
non-sequential file descriptors, but that library cannot safely turn them
on for the whole process without risking the creation of difficult bugs in
obscure situations.  It has been suggested that linker tricks could be used
to avoid bringing older libraries, but Ulrich <a
href="/Articles/237734/">feels</a> that people would respond by simply
recompiling the older libraries and the potential bugs would remain.
<p>

Linus <a href="/Articles/237737/">came into the discussion</a> with a
statement that neither adding a bunch of new system calls nor the global
flag were acceptable.  Instead, he came up with a completely different
idea: create a mechanism which allows a single system call to be invoked
with a specific set of flags.  His proposed interface is:
<p>
<pre>
    int syscall_indirect(unsigned long flags, sigset_t sigmask,
                         int syscall, unsigned long args[6]);
</pre>
<p>
The result would be a call to the given system call with the requested
arguments.  For the duration of the call, the given <tt>flags</tt> would be
in effect, and signals in <tt>sigmask</tt> would be blocked.  Even before
adding any flags, this mechanism could be used to implement the series of
system calls (<tt>pselect()</tt>, for example) which exists only to apply a
signal mask to an earlier version of the call.  Then the non-sequential
file descriptor and close-on-exec behavior could be requested via the
<tt>flags</tt> argument.  Beyond that, flags could be added to control the
handling of symbolic links, and various other things.  Matt Mackall
suggested that the "syslet" mechanism could be implemented as a "run this
call asynchronously" flag.
<p>
This approach is not without its potential problems.  There are worries
that the <tt>flags</tt> bits could be quickly exhausted, once again making
it hard to add options to existing system calls.  Linus <a
href="/Articles/237745/">suggests</a> overloading the flag bits as a way of
making them last longer.  That approach risks problems if application
developers attempt to apply the wrong flags for a given system call - there would
be no automatic way of catching such errors - but it is unlikely that
applications would be calling <tt>syscall_indirect()</tt> themselves, so
this risk is relatively small.  It is appropriate to worry about
whether any conceivable, sensible behavior modification is covered by this
interface, or whether it needs a different set of parameters.  And one
might well wonder whether, some years from now, a large percentage of
system calls will be made via <tt>syscall_indirect()</tt>.
<p>

This new system call suffers from one other shortcoming as well: there is
currently no working implementation.  That will likely change at some
point, leading to a wider discussion of the proposed interface.  If it
still seems like a good idea, we might just have a way of adding new
behavior to old functions without an explosion in the number of system
calls.  Sometimes, perhaps, it really is true that problems in computer
science are best solved through the addition of another level of indirection.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Odd, I recollect building apps which used high-numbered FDs
via a well-known idiom, below.  I would expect that anyone
who needed to grab an FD for out-of-band use would use 
something like
<PRE>
       if (fstat(maxFd, &amp;stat_buf) == -1) {
                /* It's not in use, so grab it. */
                if (fcntl(confFd, F_DUPFD, maxFd) != -1) {
                        /* Turns off FD_CLOEXEC as a sideffect. */
                        UTIL_CLOSE(confFd);
                        confFd = maxFd;
                }
        }
        maxFd--;
</PRE>
Does that mean this ia not as well-known in the application-design world
as one would expect? It's the problem that motivated adding
fcntl(F_DUPFD) to the system, after all.

      That works fine in apps, but not in libraries. If a library wants to open some persistent fd, it currently has no guarantee that the app hasn't closed that fd on it, or dup2()ed another one over the top of it. I've seen problems with syslog() caused by exactly this in the past, and even problems with the three standard fds (buggy app closes them all rather than opening /dev/null three times and wackiness ensues.)<br>

      Hmmn, any app writer who kills his own syslog get exactly what<br>
they deserve (;-))<br>
<p>
Joking aside, the code snippit was from a LD_PRELOAD library that<br>
I tested with approximtely 2954 popular apps (on Solaris, mind<br>
you) without getting whacked.  <br>
<p>
I suspect normal evolution will prune out the exceptions over<br>
time: the commercial plus open-source Solaris space seems<br>
to be pretty well clean.<br>

<p>Any syslog that allows the user app to kill it through normal standard procedures (e.g. closing fds for a daemon) is broken. :-)
<p>Unfortunately, this is one of those cases where you have to know something about the underlying libc implementation to avoid screwing yourself. In particular, most of the implementations I've worked with only break if you've called openlog().

<p>
It's not that you have to know the underlying libc implementation.  Rather, you have to know libc's requirements of its environment.  You don't leave a file descriptor open because you know syslog functions use it; you leave it open because the syslog facility requires you not to mess with any file descriptor you didn't create.
<p>
There are dozens of ways a library places requirements on its environment because of resources shared among all code in the process.  Some of the requirements are easily accepted, such as that a caller should not write over any memory it did not allocate (which allows the library to keep memory of its own).  Sometimes the requirements are onerous, but "broken" is too strong a word for a library with inconvenient requirements.  "less useful" or "dangerous" are better descriptions.  Signal handlers, alarms, environment variables, stack space, terminal display space, Standard Error file contents, etc. are all controversial.

<p>
But that's also true of the kernel modifications being proposed.  And it's similar to the risk that the app will write over memory that was malloc'ed by the library.  The app and library, in a single thread, can stay out of each others' way with the F_DUPFD method if they observe obvious protocol.  That is in contrast with simple open(), in which a library call can defeat its caller's assumptions of sequentially allocated file descriptors.
<p>
What the kernel proposal has that F_DUPFD doesn't is that 1) it works even multithreaded (the F_DUPFD method requires the library to temporarily to use a low FD, and another thread could see that) and 2) it allows the high fds to be higher (today, the maximum fd is quite low because of the way the kernel data structures are).

      I believe the context of the whole file descriptor discussion involves threading and the bad performance of high file descriptors.<br>
<p>
If your library wants to dup2 a high file descriptor, another library could be trying the same trick in another thread and screw up the whole thing if it happened at just the right point between your fstat and the dup.<br>
<p>
<p>
The performance problems happen because of the way file descriptors are handled in-kernel.<br>

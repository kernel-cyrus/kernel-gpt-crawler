<p>
The rhashtable data structure is a generic resizable hash-table
implementation in the Linux kernel, which LWN first <a
href="/Articles/612021/">introduced</a> as "relativistic
hash tables" back in 2014.  I thought at the time that  it might be fun to make
use of rhashtables, but didn't, until an opportunity arose through my work on
the Lustre filesystem.  Lustre is a cluster filesystem that is currently in
<tt>drivers/staging</tt> while the code is revised to meet upstream
requirements.  One of those requirements is to avoid duplicating
similar functionality where possible.  As Lustre contains a resizable
hash table, it really needs to be converted to use rhashtables instead â€” at
last I have my opportunity.

<p>It didn't take me long to discover that the rhashtable implementation
in Linux 4.15 is quite different from the one that originally landed in
Linux 3.17, so the original LWN introduction is now barely relevant.
I also quickly discovered that the in-kernel documentation was
partially wrong, far from complete, and didn't provide any sort of
"getting started" guide.  Nevertheless I persisted and eventually
developed a fairly complete understanding of the code, which seems
worth sharing.  This article gives an introduction to the use of
the rhashtable interfaces without getting into too many internal
implementation details.  A followup will explain how rhashtables work
internally and show how some of the mechanism details leak though the
interfaces.

<h4>Creating your first hash table</h4>

<p>Suppose you have some data structure that you want to store in a
hash table.  This data structure will have a key and, usually, some
other content.  To work with rhashtables, the data structure must
contain a <tt>struct rhash_head</tt> field which is used for table linkage,
so the whole structure might be:

<pre>
    struct object {
	int key;
	struct rhash_head linkage;
	char content[64];
	refcount_t ref;
	struct rcu_head rcu_read;
    };
</pre>

<p>This example includes a reference counter and an <tt>rcu_head</tt> for
lifetime management, which will be used in later examples.

<p>Creating a hash table to store some of these structures requires declaring some
parameters and calling <tt>rhashtable_init()</tt>, for example:

<pre>
    const static struct rhashtable_params object_params = {
	.key_len     = sizeof(int),
	.key_offset  = offsetof(struct object, key),
	.head_offset = offsetof(struct object, linkage),
    };

    struct rhashtable my_objects;

    success = rhashtable_init(&amp;my_objects, &amp;object_params);
</pre>

<p><tt>rhashtable_init()</tt> can fail with <tt>-EINVAL</tt> if some of the
parameters given are invalid (this example only shows a small selection of
the available parameters) or <tt>-ENOMEM</tt> if it failed to allocate some
required memory.

<p>Providing just the length and offset of the key is sufficient for
simple keys; rhashtables will provide code to compute a hash over
the given number of bytes and do a byte-by-byte comparison to see if
a given key matches an object.  Often, keys are not that simple.
Examples where length-plus-offset is not sufficient include:

<ul class="spacylist">

<li> a variable-length key, such as a NUL-terminated string</li>

<li> a key that is not directly contained in the object, but is
accessed through a pointer in the object</li>

<li> a key that is a C <tt>struct</tt> that might contain padding bytes.
It is hard to guarantee these bytes will be zero, so a direct
comparison is unlikely to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, a hash function (<tt>.hashfn()</tt>) and object comparison
function (<tt>.obj_cmpfn()</tt>) can be provided with signatures matching:

<pre>
    struct rhashtable_compare_arg {
	struct rhashtable *ht;
	const void *key;
    };
    typedef u32 (*rht_hashfn_t)(const void *data, u32 len, u32 seed);
    typedef int (*rht_obj_cmpfn_t)(struct rhashtable_compare_arg *arg,
	         const void *obj);
</pre>

<p>When these are provided, the <tt>key_len</tt> is largely ignored, though
it should be given a non-zero value since a <tt>key_len</tt> of zero indicates
a more complex approach to hashing that is described later.  The
<tt>obj_cmpfn()</tt> should return zero for a match and non-zero otherwise,
much like <tt>memcmp()</tt>.  I like to return a negative error code, such
as <tt>-ESRCH</tt>, rather than <tt>1</tt> as some in-kernel users do; it
makes it more obvious
when reading the code that zero means "success".

<h4>Putting objects in the table</h4>

<p>The most general way to insert into a hash table is to call:

<pre>
    old_obj = rhashtable_lookup_get_insert_fast(&amp;my_objects, &amp;new_obj.linkage, object_params);
</pre>

<p>If an object already exists in the table with the same key, it is
returned as <tt>old_obj</tt> and <tt>new_obj</tt> is not inserted.  If no
such old object exists, <tt>new_obj</tt> will normally be inserted and
<tt>NULL</tt> will be returned.  It is technically possible for insertion
to fail, in which case an <tt>ERR_PTR()</tt> is returned.  These error
cases will be explained in the next article once the required context has
been presented.

<p>If you don't want the old object (i.e. don't want to "get" it), or don't
even want to check if it 
exists (no "lookup" wanted), other interfaces are available.  The three
main insert 
interfaces are:

<pre>
    void *rhashtable_lookup_get_insert_fast(struct rhashtable *ht, struct rhash_head *obj,
		const struct rhashtable_params params);

    int rhashtable_lookup_insert_fast(struct rhashtable *ht, struct rhash_head *obj,
		const struct rhashtable_params params);

    int rhashtable_insert_fast(struct rhashtable *ht, struct rhash_head *obj,
		const struct rhashtable_params params);
</pre>

<p>The fact that they all end in the word <tt>fast</tt> is probably
historical accident; there are no "slow" versions.  All rhashtable
interfaces are "fast" in that they never sleep and can be called from
interrupt handlers, while holding spinlocks, or in any other atomic
context. Note that rhashtable_insert_fast() can insert duplicates in the
   table, so it must be used with caution.

<p>The passing of the <tt>params</tt> argument to these
functions by value deserves some explanation.  The parameters were already
passed when the table was created, so the <tt>ht</tt> argument should already
contain the parameter information â€” why pass it again?

<p>All of these insert functions, as well as the lookup and remove
functions that we will meet shortly, are defined in
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.16.1/source/include/linux/rhashtable.h"><tt>include/linux/rhashtable.h</tt></a>
as <tt>static inline</tt> functions, so
the compiler generates a new copy of the code every place they are called.
Because <tt>params</tt> is declared as a <tt>const</tt> by-value argument,
the compiler can treat it as constant during code optimization and can
discard code that is never used.  In the example given above, no
<tt>hashfn()</tt> is specified, so the code that ultimately gets run won't
even test to see if there is a hash function.  It will go directly to the
default hash function (<tt>jhash2()</tt> in this case â€” the Jenkins hash
function).  This approach allows a
lot of flexibility in the C code, with minimal overhead at run time.

<h4>Lookup and object lifetimes</h4>

<p>An object can be found in the hash table using <tt>rhashtable_lookup_fast()</tt>:

<pre>
    void *rhashtable_lookup_fast(struct rhashtable *ht, const void *key,
	const struct rhashtable_params params);
</pre>

<p>for example:

<pre>
    int key = 42;
    struct object *found = rhashtable_lookup_fast(&amp;my_objects, &amp;key, object_params);
</pre>

<p>Note that there is a slight asymmetry between insert and lookup.  When
inserting an object, the address of the linkage (the <tt>rhash_head</tt>
structure embedded in that object) is passed in.  When looking
up an object, the address of the whole object is returned.  This is a
stable pattern across the whole API and is easy to get used to: pass in the
address of the linkage, get back the address of the object.

<p>When performing a lookup, you need always to be mindful of object
lifetimes to ensure you don't find an object just as it is being
deleted.  In my previous experience with hash tables, each object in
the table has a reference count which is incremented as part of the
lookup operation while a hash-table lock is still held.  Object
removal takes the same lock and ensures that a newly looked-up object
isn't removed.  The resizable hash-table implementation in Lustre
understands this and can be told how to increment or decrement a
reference counter so that race-free lookup is easy.  Rhashtables
provide no such support.

<p>While this may seem like a weakness in rhashtables, it is really a
strength.  There are many different protocols that can be used to manage
object lifetimes and, even with the fairly common reference-counter
approach, there are different rules as to what happens when the count
reaches zero.  Encoding all these in the rhashtable code would be unwieldy;
leaving it to the caller allows complete flexibility.

<p>One of the benefits of integrating object lifetimes with the hash table
is that the hash-table lock can be leveraged to help with lifetimes.
Without that benefit, a caller must provide their own locking.  In many
cases the RCU read lock is quite sufficient, and its cost is usually
indistinguishable from zero.

<p>A common lifetime rule has an object removed from the hash table only
when the reference count becomes zero.  In this case there is a small
window between zero being reached and the removal completing.  This
can be allowed for on lookup with:

<pre>
    key = 42;
    rcu_read_lock();
    obj = rhashtable_lookup_fast(&amp;my_objects, &amp;key, params);
    if (obj &amp;&amp; !refcount_inc_not_zero(&amp;obj-&gt;ref))
	obj = NULL;
    rcu_read_unlock();
</pre>

<h4>Object removal</h4>

<p>To remove an object from the table, use <tt>rhashtable_remove_fast()</tt>:

<pre>
    int rhashtable_remove_fast(struct rhashtable *ht, struct rhash_head *obj,
			       const struct rhashtable_params params);
</pre>

<p>This call will fail with <tt>-ENOENT</tt> if the object isn't found.  There is no
interface to remove an object given only the key, but you can easily
combine lookup with removal:

<pre>
    rcu_read_lock();
    obj = rhashtable_lookup_fast(table, key, params);
    if (obj &amp;&amp; rhashtable_remove_fast(table, &amp;obj-&gt;linkage, params) == 0)
	kfree_rcu(obj, rcu_head);
    rcu_read_unlock();
</pre>

<p>When using RCU to help manage object lifetimes, it is important to use
<tt>kfree_rcu()</tt> or similar to free the object, so the memory doesn't get
reused while some other thread is performing a concurrent lookup,
hence its inclusion in this example.

<p>To complete the example started earlier where an object is removed when
the reference count becomes zero, the removal code might look like:

<pre>
    if (refcount_dec_and_test(&amp;obj-&gt;ref)) {
	rhashtable_remove_fast(&amp;my_objects, &amp;obj-&gt;linkage, object_params);
	kfree_rcu(obj, rcu_head);
    }
</pre>

<h4>Walking all the objects in the table</h4>

<p>It is occasionally useful to iterate (or "walk") over all the objects
in a hash table.  Rhashtables make this fairly easy, though there are
some caveats.  To support walking there is one data structure and six
functions:

<pre>
    struct rhashtable_iter;

    void rhashtable_walk_enter(struct rhashtable *ht, struct rhashtable_iter *iter);
    int rhashtable_walk_start_check(struct rhashtable_iter *iter);
    void rhashtable_walk_start(struct rhashtable_iter *iter);
    void *rhashtable_walk_next(struct rhashtable_iter *iter);
    void rhashtable_walk_stop(struct rhashtable_iter *iter);
    void rhashtable_walk_exit(struct rhashtable_iter *iter);
</pre>

<p>There are two different protocols for keeping track of the "current"
location in the table during a walk, one that assumes the RCU read lock is
held and one that does not.  These can be mixed, so RCU might be held
while walking for a while, then it might be dropped for a while, at which
point the
non-RCU protocol must be used to continue.  This subtlety explains why
there is both an enter/exit pair of functions, and a start/stop pair.  The
enter/exit pair must be called at the beginning and end, respectively, and
they set up, then tear down, the iterator (<tt>struct
rhashtable_iter</tt>).  During a walk, the start/stop pair must be called
at least once and all calls to <tt>rhashtable_walk_next()</tt> must occur
between <tt>rhashtable_walk_start()</tt> and <tt>rhashtable_walk_stop()</tt>.

<p>To make this more concrete, a simple table walk that proceeds entirely
under the RCU read lock might be:

<pre>
    struct rhashtable_iter iter;

    rhashtable_walk_enter(&amp;my_objects, &amp;iter);
    rhashtable_walk_start(&amp;iter);
    while ((obj = rhashtable_walk_next(&amp;iter)) != NULL) {
	if (IS_ERR(obj))
	    continue;
	printk_obj(obj);
    }
    rhashtable_walk_stop(&amp;iter);
    rhashtable_walk_exit(&amp;iter);
</pre>

<p>The RCU read lock is held between <tt>rhashtable_walk_start()</tt> and
<tt>rhashtable_walk_stop()</tt> so nothing in the body of the walk is
permitted to sleep.  This walk is completely safe against concurrent
insertions and removal: any object that was in the table at the start
and is still there at the end will be printed.  Objects inserted or
removed during the walk may or may not be seen.  It is quite safe to
remove the object that you are visiting when walking like this.

<p>If the hash table is resized during the walk, it is possible to see
duplicates and <tt>rhashtable_walk_next()</tt> can return with the error
<tt>-EAGAIN</tt> at some point, hence the test.  The implication of this will
be detailed in the followup article.

<p>If the action on some objects needs to potentially sleep, then the
walk must be temporarily "stopped", for example:

<pre>
    struct rhashtable_iter iter;

    rhashtable_walk_enter(&amp;my_objects, &amp;iter);
    rhashtable_walk_start(&amp;iter);
    while ((obj = rhashtable_walk_next(&amp;iter)) != NULL) {
	if (IS_ERR(obj))
	    continue;
	if (uninteresting(obj))
	    continue;
	if (!refcount_inc_not_zero(&amp;obj-&gt;ref))
	    continue;
	rhashtable_walk_stop(&amp;iter);
	do_something_slow(obj);
	rhashtable_walk_start(&amp;iter);
	obj_put(obj);
    }
    rhashtable_walk_stop(&amp;iter);
    rhashtable_walk_exit(&amp;iter);
</pre>

<p>When <tt>rhashtable_walk_stop()</tt> drops the RCU read lock, the
rhashtable code
can no longer be sure that <tt>obj</tt> will remain in the table, so
<tt>rhashtable_walk_next()</tt> cannot just get the "next" object from the
linkage structure.  Instead it remembers which hash chain the object was
in, and how many elements along the chain it was.  If a concurrent
insertion or removal changes the chain, the skip-count can be wrong and so
the walk might miss an object, or see a duplicate.

<p>In our <tt>my_objects</tt> running example, we need to claim a reference to
an object when dropping the RCU lock; this will prevent the object
from being removed from the table.  In this case the object is, in
fact, still in the table, so <tt>rhashtable_walk_start()</tt> should
be able to find it and restart the walk exactly where it left off.  A
patch has been submitted to implement this and, once accepted, it
should be possible to walk the hash table and be guaranteed not to
miss anything.  Guaranteeing that no duplicates will be seen is
not possible if concurrent resizes are permitted.  The implications of
this will be examined more closely when we dig into resizing next
time.

<h4>The rest of the API</h4>

<p>That covers most of the interesting parts of the API, but for
completeness we should quickly cover the remainder.

<p>When you have finished with an rhashtable it must be destroyed,
typically with <tt>rhashtable_free_and_destroy()</tt>:

<pre>
    void rhashtable_free_and_destroy(struct rhashtable *ht,
			 void (*free_fn)(void *ptr, void *arg),
			 void *arg);
</pre>

<p>This will call <tt>free_fn()</tt> on every object in the table, then free
all internally allocated data structures.  If there is nothing in the
table, or if cleanup should be avoided for some other reason, then
the simpler <tt>rhashtable_destroy()</tt> can be used.

<pre>
    void rhashtable_destroy(struct rhashtable *ht);
</pre>

<p>The <tt>rhashtable_lookup_and_insert()</tt> interfaces we looked at
above contain an implicit assumption that the key embedded in an object is
in exactly the same format as the key that would be passed to
<tt>rhashtable_lookup()</tt>.  This is not always the case, as seen in an
example from the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c?h=v4.15#n2720">Mellanox
Ethernet driver</a> that has a lookup key with a linked list of values, and
an object that contains an array of these values.  As the
<tt>obj_cmpfn()</tt> expects a lookup key and an object, this circumstance
can only be managed if the insert function is passed both a key and an
object.  Further, a table like this will need two different hash functions,
one to hash a standalone key and one to hash the key that is embedded in
an object.

<p>To use rhashtable with this sort of key, three changes to the normal
approach are needed:

<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>.key_len</tt> must be set to 0 (or left unset).

<li> A new function <tt>.obj_hashfn</tt> must be provided in the parameters.
It has the same signature as <tt>hashfn()</tt> but is passed the object
rather than the key.

<li> Instead of the <tt>lookup_insert</tt> functions already listed, one of the
<tt>insert_key</tt> functions must be used:

<pre>
    static inline void *rhashtable_lookup_get_insert_key(struct rhashtable *ht,
 			const void *key, struct rhash_head *obj,
			const struct rhashtable_params params);

    static inline int rhashtable_lookup_insert_key(struct rhashtable *ht, 
			const void *key, struct rhash_head *obj,
			const struct rhashtable_params params);
</pre>

</ul>
<p>Sometimes you might want a hash table to potentially contain multiple
objects for any given key.  In that case you can use "rhltables" â€”
rhashtables with lists of objects.  The interfaces are much the same as for
rhashtables except that the table is represented by <tt>struct rhltable</tt>
and the function names start with <tt>rhltable_</tt> instead of
<tt>rhashtable_</tt>:

<pre>
    int rhltable_init(struct rhltable *hlt, const struct rhashtable_params *params);
    struct rhlist_head *rhltable_lookup(struct rhltable *hlt, const void *key,
	const struct rhashtable_params params);
    int rhltable_insert(struct rhltable *hlt, struct rhlist_head *list,
	const struct rhashtable_params params);
    int rhltable_insert_key(struct rhltable *hlt, const void *key, 
	struct rhlist_head *list, const struct rhashtable_params params);
    int rhltable_remove(struct rhltable *hlt, struct rhlist_head *list,
	const struct rhashtable_params params);
    void rhltable_walk_enter(struct rhltable *hlt, struct rhashtable_iter *iter);
    void rhltable_free_and_destroy(struct rhltable *hlt,

<h4>What's next?</h4>

<p>This completes the "getting started" introduction, which has already
helped improve code quality as I found, while writing this, that some of my
Lustre conversion was wrong.  It should be enough for others to
successfully use rhashtables in their own code, but it is not yet complete.
There are more configuration parameters, and various subtleties related to
resizing that need to be understood before you can be sure that all cases
are covered.  This will be explored in <a href="/Articles/751974/">the
second half of this series</a>.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Indeed, thanks for the report.  Next time, though, we would sure appreciate it if you email typo reports to lwn@lwn.net.<br>

Atleast the APIs seem very similar to list_init( ) , list_create( ) , list_insert( ) in Solaris.<br>

      For a while now I've been interested in using this with WireGuard, <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/tree/src/hashtables.c">instead of using fixed-size hash tables by way of <tt>DECLARE_HASHTABLE</tt></a>. I'll need to change out the underlying hash function away from <tt>jhash2</tt>, presumably using the <tt>.hash_fn</tt> member as described here. In one instance, I use <tt>siphash</tt>, since values are attacker controlled, and in the other instance, I simply take the first N bits of the key, because the keys are already guaranteed to be uniformly distributed and non-attacker controlled. This article provides some nice motivation for actually getting this done.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; The fact that they all end in the word fast is probably historical accident; there are no "slow" versions.</font><br>
<p>
There is a function rhashtable_insert_slow(), but the fast insert functions will automatically bail out to it (if rehashing is in progress or something might require rehashing).<br>

It might be nice to have an explanation of what errors the rhashtable functions can throw, and when. For example, when does -EBUSY happen, and are there any rules that must be observed to allow the -EAGAIN retry loop in the slowpath to make forward progress?<br>

One might be tempted to think that an operating-system kernel should be
able to answer a simple question: how much memory is a given process
actually using?  But, despite all the effort that has gone into providing
visibility for this type of data, simple answers can be hard to come by.
So the effort to provide better information continues, as can be seen by a
recent <a href="/Articles/642135/">patch set</a> from Vladimir Davydov
adding another way to calculate memory utilization.
<p>
A process's resident set size (RSS) is relatively easily calculated; that
is the number of pages of physical memory currently owned by that process.
Interested parties can get this information now from <tt>/proc</tt> or the
<tt>ps</tt> command.  In theory, the kernel is handling page reclaim in
such a way that each process is actually <i>using</i> every page in its
resident set, but, in the real world, things don't always work out that
way.
<p>
It can be worth knowing if there is a significant difference between
a process's RSS and the amount of memory actually in use; this information
can be helpful when partitioning the system between containers or
setting control-group limits.  As it happens, the kernel contains a
mechanism designed to allow an observer to determine how much of a
process's resident set has actually been referenced.  That information is
found in a virtual file called <tt>smaps</tt> in the process's
<tt>/proc</tt> directory.  For example, the following fragment comes from
the <tt>smaps</tt> file corresponding the the X.org server on your editor's
desktop:
<p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
This entry describes an anonymous memory area that occupies 53,472KB of
memory; 51,936KB of that area is currently resident (the <tt>Rss</tt>
field), and 45,384KB have been referenced (the line in bold) since tracking
was last reset. 
Since nothing is monitoring memory use on this system, that number has
never been reset and thus counts
every page referenced since the X.org server started.
<p>
If one wants to track usage over a specific period, it is necessary to
reset the "referenced" count at the beginning, let the process run for a
bit, then look in <tt>smaps</tt> to see how much memory was actually
touched.  That reset is done by writing a value of <tt>1</tt> to the
<tt>clear_refs</tt> file in the same <tt>/proc</tt> directory.
<p>
At a first look, this mechanism seems like it should be able to answer the
question of how much memory a process is actually using.  But it turned out
to not meet Vladimir's needs for a couple of reasons.  One of those is
that, while the <tt>smaps</tt> entry tracks references to memory mapped
into the process's address space, it does not track page-cache memory used
when files are accessed with system calls like <tt>read()</tt> or
<tt>write()</tt>.  That memory, too, is used by the process, so there would
be value in knowing how much of it there is.  Perhaps more importantly, the
"referenced" state of each page is used by the memory-management subsystem
itself to make decisions on which pages to evict.  Resetting every page to
the "not referenced" state will thus perturb page reclaim, and probably not
for the better.  If these measurements are to be made often, it would be
good to have a less invasive way to make them.
<p>
Vladimir's patch adds a new file called <tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt>; since
it's in the top-level <tt>/proc</tt> directory, it's a single file that
describes an aspect of the the global state of the system.  The file can be
read like a long array of 64-bit integer values; each value corresponds to
one physical page in the system, indexed by page-frame number.  If a
program wants to know whether physical page <i>N</i> has been referenced,
it can seek to the appropriate location in <tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt> and
read the value there; if the lowest bit is set, the page is idle.  (Note
that <a href="/Articles/642358/">this file may change to a bitmap
format</a> in a future version of the patch set).
<p>
Once again, one needs to be able to reset that state to make observations
over a given time period; in this case, setting a page to the "idle" state
is done by writing <tt>1</tt> to the appropriate location in
<tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt>.  That action will make the page inaccessible
(much like the normal kernel usage tracking does) so that a fault will
result whenever a process tries to read or write that page.  At that point,
the "idle" state can be reset and the page made accessible again.  The idle
state will also be reset if the page is accessed via the file-related system
calls, so it will track the state of pages in the page cache as well.
<p>
To track the idle state, the patch set adds a new "idle" page flag that is set
whenever a page is marked idle.  That flag is then passed back to user
space whenever a given page's entry in <tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt> is read.  As
it turns out, there is a need for a second page flag as well, though.
As mentioned above, making a page inaccessible is a technique already used
within the memory-management subsystem; when a write to
<tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt> causes that to happen, it makes the page appear to
have <i>never</i> been accessed.  To avoid that, Vladimir adds a second
flag called "young"; whenever a write to <tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt> makes a
page inaccessible, the "young" bit will be set as well.  When the
memory-management code asks whether a page has been referenced, the "young"
bit is taken into account.  In the end, that means that using
<tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt> will not change how page reclaim is done.
<p>
There is one little problem with this approach: page flags are in short
supply on 32-bit systems.  To get around this problem, the code uses the
"<tt>struct page</tt> extension" mechanism in the 32-bit case.  This
mechanism was originally created to support memory control groups (memcgs),
which need to store more information about each page than can fit in the
<tt>page</tt> structure.  Using extensions can use quite a bit of memory in
its own right, but there's little alternative on systems where shoehorning
even one more bit into <tt>struct page</tt> is not an option.
<p>
Readers who have gotten this far may be wondering about one final piece of
the puzzle: knowing which physical pages in the system are in use does not
say much about what any specific processes are using.  There are two ways
of connecting the two pieces, one of which exists now and one which is part
of Vladimir's patch.  In current systems, the <tt>pagemap</tt> file in any
process's <tt>/proc</tt> directory can be used to see which physical pages
are mapped into that process's address space.  That information is <a
href="/Articles/642069/">only available to privileged processes</a> as of
the 4.0 release, but <tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt> is a privileged interface
too.
<p>
If the task at hand is partitioning a system's resources, though, then
memcgs are likely already in use to set limits on groups of processes.  In
that case, it is more interesting to know how much memory each memcg is
using than to track this information on a per-process basis.  To that end,
the patch set adds yet another file (<tt>/proc/kpagecgroup</tt>) which,
when read, yields the control group that owns each page.  By using that
file together with <tt>/proc/kpageidle</tt>, a monitoring process can
determine how many pages each memcg is using — and how many it owns but is
not making use of.
<p>
The end result is an interface that can be used to determine how well a
control group's memory limits fit its actual needs.  As service providers
of all types seek to run more clients on each physical system, they will
likely be pleased to have this extra information available.  That, of
course, depends on this patch set being merged into the mainline.  Given
the lack of significant opposition, that seems likely to happen sooner or
later — though, with memory-management patches, it's always hard to say
just when that might happen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
I believe Intel/AMD processor have an "accessed" bit for each page so that you would not need to make the page inaccessible (and save the exception CPU time to swap it back to accessible, all being done in hardware).<br>
I believe ARM do not have that "accessed" bit.<br>

      <P>I can confirm that ARM (at least as of v7, using LPAE) has an Accessed Flag (AF) in the page table entry.  (I've only ever worked directly with LPAE; I've avoided the horror show that is ARM's 32-bit page table format.)  When LPAE is enabled, you can set the MMU to automatically manage the AF, or to fault on access to a page that has AF=0 so that software can set the flag and do whatever other bookkeeping it desires.</P>
<P>When you configure the ARM hardware to automatically set AF, then this all happens silently in the background.  If you configure the ARM hardware to fault when AF=0, then clearing AF is effectively removes access to the page.  You take a page fault on accessing it.</P>
<P>I haven't gotten into the guts of how Linux uses flags such as these when the hardware offers them.  For example, when LPAE is in use, does ARM Linux configure the MMU to manage AF in hardware or software?</P>

The Android system is designed to provide a responsive user experience on
systems that, in a relative sense at least, have limited amounts of
CPU and memory.  Doing so requires a number of techniques, including
regular use of 
a low-memory process killer, that are not seen elsewhere.  In a
memory-management-track session at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit, Suren Baghdasaryan covered a number of issues
related to how Android ensures that interactive processes have enough
memory to get their jobs done.
<p>
Baghdasaryan started by noting that the recently added <a
href="/Articles/759781/">pressure-stall information</a> feature, which was
not originally developed for Android at all, has proved to be quite
useful.  It gives the Android runtime more accurate information about
memory pressure, which can be used to better manage the set of running
processes.  Overall, he said, the goal of Android memory management is to
ensure that interactive processes work as well as possible while minimizing
the number of out-of-memory kills needed to do that.
<p>
The Android <a
href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/perf/lmkd">low-memory killer
daemon</a> (LMKD) is charged with making all of this happen.  Beyond
pressure-stall information, a number of recent developments are helping to
make it more effective at that task.  File descriptors that represent

processes (<a href="/Articles/784831/">discussed here</a>) are helpful, and
the upcoming ability to <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190425190010.46489-1-joel@joelfernandes.org/">poll
those descriptors</a> for process death will also be useful.  But there are
still issues with reclaiming memory when the need arises.  The use of
control groups, while helpful in many ways, does split the kernel's
least-recently-used (LRU) list into a large number of smaller lists, which
makes reclaim harder in general.
<p>
The core issue discussed in this session, though, was quick reclaim of
memory from processes that have been killed by LMKD.  Depending on what
else is happening in the system, that reclaim can take a long and
unpredictable time, which makes LMKD's problem harder and forces it to kill
processes sooner than it otherwise would.  Baghdasaryan's <a
href="/Articles/785709/">opportunistic reclaim patches</a> are an attempt
to improve this situation; this feature tries to immediately strip memory
from a process that has been explicitly killed.  That avoids situations
where the target process itself may be slow to free those resources, making
reclaim faster and more predictable.
<p>
The first implementation was based on the <a
href="/Articles/668126/#reaper">OOM reaper</a> code which, he said, is
probably not how a final implementation should look.  But getting to that
final version requires answering a few questions, the first of which was
where the work of reaping of memory from a killed process should be done.  One
option is to have the process sending the <tt>SIGKILL</tt> signal take
responsibility (in kernel space) for this reclaim work.  There are a number
of advantages to doing things that way: it is relatively simple to
implement, the CPU time required will be charged to the killing process,
priority inheritance for the reclaim work will happen automatically, and it
provides for better user-space control over when this work is done.  On the
other hand, it may require a new user-space API to control opportunistic
reclaim, and the scalability of reclaim from large processes could be a
problem.
<p>
The alternative would be to do this work in one or more kernel threads.
That simplifies the API issues and might make things more scalable.  That,
however, takes away any sort of user control over when expedited reclaim
might happen.
<p>
Rik van Riel observed that this is, at its core, a hardware problem.  At
some point, mobile devices will get fast enough, with enough memory, that
the reclaim problem will go away by itself.  In that case, adding a new API
to speed up reclaim might well be the wrong thing to do.  Michal Hocko,
though, said that the real problem is processes that are blocked (and thus
cannot do their own cleanup) rather than hardware limitations.
<p>
Johannes Weiner said that, to the extent that hardware is the problem,
things could be improved by automatically moving exiting processes to the
fastest CPU in the system.  Other resource limits are waived on exiting
processes so they can get out of the way quickly, he said, so it might make
sense to do the same with regard to CPU placement.  Others worried that
this could create power-consumption issues, but since this situation tends
to come about when an interactive process wants to run, a fast CPU should
be running and available anyway.
<p>
Hocko replied that power use is not a big concern, but that process
isolation might be.  If a process has been confined to a slow CPU, moving
it to a fast one, even if it's just to die, may break the isolation between
groups and affect the running of interactive processes.  If the desire is
to have a killed process do its cleanup on a fast CPU, the solution is for
user space to explicitly move the process to a different control group
prior to killing it.
<p>
Mel Gorman said that there are a couple of problems that need to be
addressed here.  One is that there is not enough CPU time to do the cleanup
work quickly.  But the other aspect is that address spaces have gotten so
large that even the fastest CPU is limited in how quickly it can get the
job done.  But the best solution is simple, he said, at least on the kernel
side: an exiting process should be migrated to a fast CPU if its CPU mask
allows that.  The rest of the problem can be solved in user space, which
can move the process prior to killing it if reclaim time is an issue.
Doing anything else in the kernel would, he said, break isolation for
somebody eventually.
<p>
Matthew Wilcox returned to the issue of doing the reclaim in the context of
the killing process, which skirts around a number of these issues.  Gorman
replied that implementing reclaim that way is guaranteed to increase the
number of inter-processor interrupts, since the killed process's memory
will have been touched on two separate CPUs.  That would not be good for
performance  There are also concerns that doing reclaim this way would turn
the <tt>kill()</tt> system call into a blocking operation that could run
for an arbitrary time, which could surprise callers.
<p>
One final option that was discussed was a remote version of the
<tt>madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)</tt> operation; that would allow one process to
force reclaim of (some of) another process's memory.  Gorman worried, though,
that this operation would have a large "potential for shenanigans"; this
concern could be addressed by applying the usual "can the calling process
use <tt>ptrace()</tt> on the target?" test.  This call would have the
advantage that it could be done in multiple threads, each of which would
release a part of the address space; that would be a simple way of
parallelizing the task.  At the close of the session, it was also suggested
that either <tt>fadvise()</tt> or <tt>truncate()</tt>, when called on a
process file descriptor, could be given the effect of reclaiming that
process's memory, but the idea was not developed further.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The first question is: Is there space for another signal in the signal mask? But maybe this is not even necessary, as it would be a signal that could not be blocked anyway.<br>
<p>
Of course, the system call would still be turned into a blocking operation, but only for those callers that use the new signal. The only callers that might be surprised by this are those that take the signal to use as an argument, as anyone explicitly using the new signal should not be surprised.<br>
<p>
E.g. there could be some system management application that takes the signal to send for the administrator and expects the kill() system call to return immediately. Such an application could have a problem, even if we use a new signal.<br>

Not that I understand the scenario that well, but it said that turning "kill" into a process that could block might cause a few surprises ...<br>
<p>
Is there any way of making kill go through the target process's address space, stripping off whatever pages it can without blocking, and then let the dying process free the rest? Even if kill only strips a small bit of the address space, that may be all that's needed ...<br>

There's already a system call with wildly differing semantics selecting by passing a 'magic number' argument, namely, ioctl. The people who believe this to be the pinnacle of sensible API design aka who can't or don't want to think about anything else, could perhaps overload that once more.<br>

A new system would be an even better idea.<br>

DAX is the mechanism that enables direct access to files stored in
persistent memory arrays without the need to copy the data through the page
cache.  At the 2017 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management
Summit, Ross Zwisler led a plenary session on the future of DAX.  Development in
this area offers a number of interesting trade-offs between data safety and
enabling the highest performance.
<p>
The biggest issue for next year, Zwisler said, is finding the best way to
handle flushing of data from user space.  Data written to persistent memory
by the CPU may look like it is permanently stored but, most likely, it has
only made it as far as the cache; that data can still be lost in the
event of a crash, power failure, or asteroid strike.  For pages in the page
cache, user space can use <tt>msync()</tt> to flush the data to persistent
storage, but DAX pages explicitly avoid the page cache.  So flushing data
to permanent storage requires going through the radix tree, finding the
dirty pages, and flushing the associated cache lines.  Intel provides some
instructions for performing this flushing quickly; the kernel will use those
instructions to ensure that data is durable after an <tt>msync()</tt>
call.  So far, so good.
<p>
The problem is that there are use cases where <tt>msync()</tt> is too slow,
so users want to avoid it.  Instead, they would like to write and flush

<a href="/Articles/717958/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2017/lsfmm/RossZwisler-sm.jpg" alt="[Ross Zwisler]"
title="Ross Zwisler" class="rthumb"></a>

individual chunks of data themselves without calling into the kernel.  This
method can be quite a bit faster, 
since the application knows which data it has written, while the kernel lacks
the information to flush data at the individual cache-line level.
<p>
This technique works as long as no file-data allocations have been done in
the write path.  Otherwise, there will be changed filesystem metadata that
also needs to be flushed, and that will not happen in this scenario.  As a
result, data can be lost in a crash.  A number of solutions to this problem
have been proposed, but, according to Zwisler, Dave Chinner has called them
all "crazy".  A safer approach, <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/9/11/159">Chinner said last September</a>, is
to simply require that files be completely 
preallocated before writing begins; at that point, there should be no
metadata changes and the problem goes away.
<p>
Rik van Riel suggested that applications should be required to open files
with the <tt>O_SYNC</tt> option if they intend to access them in this mode,
but Zwisler responded that the situation is not that simple.  Jan Kara said
that the problem could come from other applications performing operations
in the filesystem that create metadata changes; those applications may be
completely unaware of the other users and will not be concerned with
flushing their changes out.

Getting around that problem would require some sort of state stored at the
inode level and not, like <tt>O_SYNC</tt>, at the file-descriptor level.
<p>
But even then, the filesystem itself can destabilize the metadata by, for
example, performing deduplication.  In the end, Kara said, the only way for
an application to know that a filesystem is in a consistent state on-disk
is to call <tt>fsync()</tt>.  Moving control of flushing to user space
breaks a lot of assumptions; there will need to be a way to prevent
filesystems from messing with things.
<p>
Zwisler said that Chinner's proposal had anticipated this problem and, as a
result, came with a lot of caveats.  It would be necessary to turn off <a
href="/Articles/684826/">reflink</a> functionality and other filesystem
features, for example. Zwisler also said that device DAX, which presents
persistent memory as 
a character device without a filesystem, exists for this kind of thing; device
DAX gives the user total control.  For the filesystem implementation, it
might be best to just go with the preallocation idea, he said, while making
it painful enough that there will be an incentive not to use it.  But the
incentives <i>to</i> use it will also be there: by avoiding system calls,
the user-controlled method is always going to be faster.
<p>
Kara said that history shows that, if somebody is interested in a feature,
businesses will 
work to provide it.  With enough motivation, these problems can be solved.
Zwisler 
said that there is a strong desire to have a filesystem in place on
persistent memory; filesystems provide or enable nice features like naming,
backups, and more.  What is really needed is a new filesystem that was
designed for persistent memory from the beginning, but that is not a
short-term solution.  Even if such a filesystem were to appear tomorrow,
it's a rare user who is willing to trust production data to a brand-new
filesystem.  So we are going to have to get by with what we have now for
some time yet.
<p>
The group concluded that, for now, users will have to get by with limiting
metadata updates or using device DAX.  With luck, adventurous users will
experiment with other ideas out of tree and better solutions will
eventually emerge.
<p>
The next question had to do with platforms that support "flush on fail"
functionality — the ability to automatically flush data to persistent
memory after a crash.  On such hardware, there is no need to worry about
doing explicit cache flushes; indeed, doing so will just slow things down.
The big problem here is that there is no discovery method for this feature,
so the user must ask for flushes to be turned off if they know that their
hardware will do flush on fail.  A
feature to allow that will be provided; it is seen as being similar to the
ability to turn off writeback caching on hard drives.
<p>
Currently DAX is still marked as an experimental feature in the kernel, and
mounting a filesystem with DAX enabled results in a warning in the log.
When, Zwisler asked, can this be turned off?  Support for the <a
href="/Articles/684826/">reflink</a> feature, or at least the ability to
"not collide with it" seems to be one remaining requirement; it is
evidently being worked on.  Dan Williams noted that DAX is currently turned
off if <tt>page</tt> structures are not available for the persistent-memory
array.  It is possible to operate without those structures, but there is no
support for huge pages, <tt>fork()</tt> will fail if persistent memory is
mapped, and it's not possible to use a debugger on programs that have that
memory mapped.  He asked whether this was worth fixing, noting that it
would not be a small job.  Interest in addressing the issue seemed
relatively low in the room.
<p>
Zwisler said that the filesystem mount options for DAX are currently
inconsistent.  With ext4, DAX either works for all files or it doesn't work
at all; XFS, instead, can enable or disable DAX on a per-inode basis.  It
would be better, he said, to have consistent behavior across filesystems
before proclaiming the feature to be stable.
<p>
Another wishlist feature is support for 1GB extra-huge pages.  Device
DAX can use such pages now, but they are not available when there is a
filesystem involved.  Fixing that problem would be relatively complex;
among other things, it would require filesystems to lay out files in
1GB-aligned extents, which none do now.  It is not clear that there is a
use case for this feature, so nobody seems motivated to make it work now.
<p>
The session concluded with a review of the changes needed to remove the
"experimental" tag from DAX.  More testing was added to the list; it's not
clear if the test coverage is as good as it need to be yet or not.  The
concerns about interaction with reflink need to be addressed, and making
the mount options consistent is also on the list (though some developers
would like to just see the mount options go away entirely).  That list is
long enough that the future of DAX seems to include "experimental" status
for a little while yet.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Correction: XFS has supported 1GB aligned extents for about 15 years now. It uses the same mechanism - extent size hints - that is being used to guarantee 2MB aligned extents for supporting huge pages with DAX on XFS. I've mentioned this during discussions several times over the past couple of years....<br>

Interesting...when Matthew last tried to get it working (over a year ago), I believe he couldn't get a 1GiB sized and aligned extent in his setup.  This made us look at realtime devices, which also didn't work with DAX.  If XFS already supports this and we just needed a different configuration, this makes the lift for 1 GiB support in FS DAX much lighter.<br>

I think realtime devices should work now that the iomap infrastructure feeds dax the block device it needs to map. I haven't tested it, but a quick glance at the code says it should work.<br>
<p>
FWIW, files in the realtime device are aligned just like normal files except they have a fixed minimum extent size hint that is set on the rt device at mkfs time (see xfs_get_extsz_hint()).  IOWs, it uses the same mechanism for aligned allocations that we're supposedly already using for huge pages with DAX..... :P<br>

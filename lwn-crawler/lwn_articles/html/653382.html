<p>
You might be surprised to learn that starting with Linux 2.6.31 (in 2009)
it has been rather easy to crash the Linux kernel.
This date marks the introduction of the
<a href="/Articles/339361/">perf_event subsystem</a>.
It is likely that perf_event is not any more prone to errors than
any other large kernel subsystem, but it has the distinction of
being subjected to intense testing from the
<a href="http://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/perf_events/fuzzer/">
perf_fuzzer</a> tool, which methodically probes the interface for bugs.
Given enough time, the tool will trigger a crash (and often fill the system
logs 
with warnings along the way).
</p>

<p>
For the past two years, an effort has been underway to fix every bug found
by the perf_fuzzer.
Progress has been made, thanks to the perf_event maintainers 
(especially Peter Zijlstra), who have been extremely
patient and helpful in fixing the errors reported.
The tool now takes hours to days before a crash occurs; previously
crashes would happen within seconds.
Most of the low-hanging fruit has been found, with the remaining
problems tending toward complex race conditions that are hard to replicate,
isolate, and fix.
</p>

<h4>Fuzzer background</h4>

<p>
A fuzzer is a tool that tests an interface by generating 
almost (but not quite) valid inputs with the intention of finding
corner-cases that trigger unexpected behavior.
The term dates back to 1988 when Barton Miller noticed that
Unix utilities would die horribly when fed unexpected characters
by his noisy ("fuzzy") modem connection.
Since then, much work has been done on fuzzers, mostly by security
researchers looking for exploitable bugs in programs.

<p>
The most common use case is to fuzz user-space programs,
but work has been done on fuzzing operating system kernels.
Various Linux kernel fuzzers are available (such as
Tavis Ormandy's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/iknowthis/">iknowthis</a>)
but by far the most well-known is Dave Jones's
<a href="http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/trinity/">Trinity</a>
(see this  <a href="/Articles/536173/">conference report</a> and this <a href="/Articles/591959/">discussion
of memory-management fuzzing</a> for more information on Trinity).
There are likely other kernel fuzzers out there;
undoubtedly security researchers have developed internal ones
that are not publicly available.
What separates the perf_fuzzer from other projects is that
it investigates not the entire kernel interface,
but only that of a <i>single</i> system call.
</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>

<p>
So why write a perf_event-specific fuzzer?
I have spent much time in the performance-analysis area of
High Performance Computing, specifically the maintenance of the
cross-platform <a href="http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/">
PAPI</a> (Performance API) performance measurement library.
The sudden appearance of the perf_event interface in 2009 
(of which I have been 
<a href="/Articles/567894/">diplomatically reported</a>
as being "sometimes critical")
led to major code changes in the PAPI project.
As an outside project, PAPI has faced many compatibility issues and ABI
breakage due to kernel changes, issues the kernel developers tend not to 
notice due to the primary consumer of the interface (the <tt>perf</tt>
tool) being 
shipped in sync with the kernel tree.
</p>

<p>
The need to keep up with the high rate of changes in the
perf_event interface led me to undertake many activities
designed to understand the interface, including writing the 
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html">
perf_event_open(2) man page</a> as well as creating a series of 
<a href="http://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/perf_events/validation/">
validation tests</a>.
While these tests continue to find bugs, they tend to be reactionaryâ€”added
after the fact (and often too late to be 
fixed before the new behavior has become ABI).
</p>

<p>
As Trinity rose in visibility, I sent some basic patches
to improve perf_event support, enough that it had a much higher chance
of generating valid events.
Those patches were there for a few years until suddenly they
became famous in 2013 due to the release of a dangerous
<a href="/Articles/550901/">kernel exploit</a>.
After this wakeup call, I wondered what other issues
might be lurking in the interface.
This led to more improvements contributed to Trinity, followed by the
development of a separate, system-call-specific fuzzer.
</p>

<h4>The perf_event interface</h4>

<p>
The perf_event interface is complex, mirroring the complicated nature
of the underlying hardware performance interfaces.
The primary entry point is the <tt>perf_event_open()</tt> system
call, which takes five arguments. 
The first argument is a structure with over forty different parameters
that interact in complex ways.
The system call returns one file descriptor per event opened;
these file descriptors can be manipulated by a number of 
other system calls:
<ul class="spacylist">
	<li><tt>prctl()</tt> &mdash; can enable or disable all active
			events in a process
	<li><tt>ioctl()</tt> &mdash;
			is used to control events, including starting,
			stopping, and adjusting existing events
	<li><tt>read()</tt> &mdash; can be used to read event values
	<li><tt>mmap()</tt> &mdash; can be used to set up a primary 
			and an auxiliary ring buffer capable of buffering 
			event results
	<li><tt>poll()</tt> &mdash; can be used to wait until buffers
			need to be read
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In addition to system calls, there are other ways to interact with
the infrastructure.
Some CPUs support reading event values from user space without entering
the kernel (on x86 this is the <tt>rdpmc</tt> instruction).
Events can be configured to send a signal on overflow after a 
pre-determined count or if an <tt>mmap()</tt> buffer is full.
There are also a large number of files under the <tt>/sys</tt> and
<tt>/proc</tt> filesystems that affect the interface.
</p>

<p>
Much of the trickiness of the perf_event interface is due to the way
it interacts with deep kernel internals.
There are software events that count performance-critical operations
such as context switches.
The overflow interrupts are handled as non-maskable interrupts (NMIs)
on many systems, which are often difficult to set up and tricky to debug.
All user breakpoint support is handled by perf_event, and there
are also interfaces for creating ftrace events and attaching
<a href="/Articles/603983/">eBPF</a> filters.
The wide scope of the perf_event code allows more chances
for code to go wrong.
</p>

<p>
For the full details on the interface, you can read the 
manual page.
In a testament to the complexity involved, this man page
is the longest system-call man page, even longer than 
the one for <tt>ptrace()</tt>.
</p>

<h4>How the fuzzer works</h4>

<p>
The perf_fuzzer program is just an infinite loop that 
randomly picks a piece of the interface to test each time through.
Inputs are also picked randomly; while in theory using completely
random inputs would eventually explore the entire search space,
in practice this would take quite a long time.
In order to more easily trigger bugs, inside knowledge
of the interface is used to generate valid and mostly-valid 
event parameters in addition to purely random ones.
</p>

<p>
The following actions are chosen from at random:
<ul class="spacylist">
<li>Open a random event &mdash; this code is shared in common with
	Trinity.
	The fuzzer repeats until a valid event is created.
<li><tt>mmap()</tt> an event &mdash; attempts are made to attach
	regular and auxiliary <tt>mmap()</tt> buffers to an event.
<li><tt>sigaction()</tt> an event &mdash; set up an overflow signal handler.
<li>Close an event.
<li>Call <tt>ioctl()</tt> on an event &mdash; this includes
	starting, stopping, refreshing, changing the period,
	attaching an ftrace filter, and attaching an eBPF program.
<li><tt>prctl()</tt> the process &mdash; this will enable or disable all events.
<li>Read from an event.
<li>Access a <tt>/proc</tt> or <tt>/sys</tt> file.
<li>Fork the process &mdash; currently only one child process
	is allowed at a time to avoid fork bombs and file descriptor
	exhaustion.
<li>Poll an event.
<li>Doing nothing (to allow some variations in timing).
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The difference between this tool and Trinity is that the latter simply
attempts to open an event.
In the rare occasion it generates a valid event, all further actions
on the file descriptor are completely random.
perf_fuzzer uses knowledge of the interface to pick the system calls
known to be relevant and targets them, allowing bugs
to be found much faster than a completely random search would.
</p>

<h4>Using the fuzzer</h4>

<p>
Running the fuzzer is straightforward.
First check out the git tree:
<pre>
    git clone http://www.github.com/deater/perf_event_tests.git
</pre>
Enter the fuzzer directory, run <tt>make</tt>, and the <tt>perf_fuzzer</tt>
binary will be generated.
You can simply run that binary, but it typically will error out at some point
due to some as-of-yet unexplained weirdness with signal handling.
A better option is to run the included <tt>fast_repro99.sh</tt>
script, which will repeatedly run the fuzzer for short amounts of time.
</p>

<p>
Before running, you probably want to configure your system to make
error reporting easy.
This usually involves setting up a serial console, as bugs are often
hard crashes that cannot be captured easily otherwise.
Once you have started the fuzzing it's just a matter of waiting.
The fuzzer will print regular updates on its fuzzing status, such as:

</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you do find a bug, please report it to the linux-kernel mailing list.
It's helpful if you can isolate it first.
At startup, the tool will output the command line (including
the random number seed) to use to try to repeat the behavior.
There are a large number of sources of non-determinism in
performance-measurement code, but the perf_fuzzer tries to avoid as 
many of these as possible.
It is often (but not always) possible to regenerate a bug by
re-running the fuzzer with the same command line.
</p>

<p>
The fuzzer does support dumping system call traces, which can
be fed into provided tools that both replay the traces as well
as generate sample test code for repeating the problem.
In the early days of the fuzzer, these tools were incredibly valuable.
However, most bugs found these days tend to be obscure race conditions
that are difficult to capture in this way, as the act of logging
to disk disrupts timing enough to not trigger the bug.
</p>

<h4>Bugs found</h4>

<p>
A large number of issues have been turned up by the fuzzer:
some are simply warnings, some cause denial of service (i.e. crashes),
and at least one has been a root exploit.
</p>

<p>
All of these bugs can be problematic, as currently it is not possible
to completely disable the perf_event interface, either at run time or
compile time.
Currently perf_event support must be built into the kernel, there is no
possibility of making it a loadable module or disabling it during the build
process.
There have been some efforts to 
<a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.oprofile/12017">
change this</a>, but it is complicated by the fact that hardware breakpoint
support depends on the presence of perf_event.
In addition, while it is possible to disable some of the perf_event
interface at runtime via <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid</tt>,
even at the most paranoid level it is still possible to create 
user-space measurement events.

Included below is a list of crashing bugs that have been found and
<i>fixed</i> since the introduction of the tool; 
many more are still under investigation.

<h4>Sample bug</h4>

<p>
An example bug found by the fuzzer was the one that eventually lead to
CVE-2013-4254.
A routine fuzzing on a 32-bit ARM Pandaboard triggered a kernel panic.
In this particular bug, the ARM
<tt>validate_event()</tt> function called
<tt>armpmu-&gt;get_event_idx()</tt> on the group leader for
an event.
However, if the group leader was not an <tt>armpmu</tt> type, 
but a PMU type with a shorter structure size (such as a software event), 
then the function pointer being called was whatever arbitrary 
value happened to be at that memory offset, which was past the end of the
structure. 
Normally, this would just cause a panic and crash but,
if you were unlucky, this arbitrary value was a valid user address.
For a short window of time in the 3.11-rc development 
cycle, this value pointed to a location initialized to
<tt>INT_MIN</tt> which is a valid user mappable address
of <tt>0x80000000</tt>.
If a user mapped exploit code there,
this bug could lead to privilege escalation, and some code was put together
that did just that. 
Luckily, this bug was found and fixed before it made it into
any released kernel.
</p>


<h4>Current and future work</h4>

<p>
Work on the fuzzer has been progressing.
Now that bugs are harder to trigger there has been time
available to enhance the functionality rather than spending the
(sometimes considerable) time needed to push a bug through to a fix
in the kernel tree.
</p>

<p>
Recent work includes adding support for testing new features (such
as the
<a href="/Articles/629480/">
introduction of the AUX ring buffer for high-volume events</a>)
as well as a push to fully test all of the perf_event
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls.
Support for <tt>ioctl()</tt> is more complex than it sounds,
as fuzzing it involved creating an ftrace 
filter generator (and the ftrace filter language is lacking documentation),
as well as some method of fuzzing the new eBPF language.
The eBPF fuzzing is currently stalled; even though there is existing
code for generating eBPF programs in Trinity, it turns out you need
to be root to actually attach such programs, and running perf_fuzzer
as root is not advised.
It might be worthwhile to harden the fuzzer so that it can run as root; part
of the problem is there are various "expected" ways you can crash
your machine as root.
This includes setting the overflow threshold so low that the machine
gets stuck in an interrupt storm, as well as problems where the 
ftrace function tracer can <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1590219">get stuck recursively trying to trace interrupt
handler functions</a>.
</p>

<p>
While I plan to continue to work on this project as long
as it finds bugs, it is important to note that it is a
volunteer effort with no support and few outside contributors.
This can be frustrating at times, as noted by 
<a href="/Articles/650824/">
Dave Jones's recent comments</a> regarding the Trinity fuzzer.
I have encountered problems similar to his, where finding and
fixing kernel bugs is appreciated, but the work is not considered
important enough to get employer support.
This work is also not considered groundbreaking enough
to easily lead to publications or grants through traditional venues, which
is needed by academics like myself.
With the demise of the Ottawa Linux Symposium, there 
are also no longer any peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings for Linux, 
which are critical for academics trying to publish Linux-related work 
in a way that matters to their home institutions.
</p>

<p>
One area with room for improvement is the amount of testing that is done
using perf_fuzzer.
The current primary testing environment is a horribly abused Haswell desktop.
Tests are also run on Intel Core&nbsp;2, Pentium&nbsp;4, and AMD Jaguar machines
when convenient.
It would be nice to test on other architectures; there is probably
low-hanging fruit for the untested ones.
Power is notable as an architecture with elaborate perf_event
support but, as of yet, has not been tested.
I have many ARM machines and try to test on those when possible.
This is complicated because,
when fuzzing, you want to run an up-to-the-minute mainline kernel
(to avoid hitting older, known bugs), but it can be extremely time-consuming
if not impossible to run mainline kernels on arbitrary ARM development boards.
</p>

<p>
One final area of future work would be to extend this to
other system calls.
There are many others out there that are currently not well-tested.
Even if a custom tool is not designed, it would be worthwhile to extend
Trinity with the lessons learned from perf_fuzzer.
While fuzzing is not the only route to ensuring a secure kernel environment,
it is definitely a powerful tool in the Linux security toolbox.

That's one of the "problems" with fuzzing: it's a great way to crash or<br>

Yes, I think my fuzzer work has been 1% writing code, 4% running the fuzzer, and 95% pushing on the bugs until the fixes make it into the kernel tree.<br>
<p>
I really would like to get a modern Power machine to run tests on locally (as it's usually impolite to fuzz on someone else's server unless they are really nice and don't mind rebooting all the time).  However Power hardware is a bit difficult to source and the price tends to be high enough to trigger extra paperwork from the purchasing department so I haven't gotten around to it yet.  Maybe I should try to resurrect the old G4 laptop that was having severe power-connector issues.<br>

<p>
Isn't it possible to running the fuzzing under something like User Mode Linux, which would turn the machine crashing into some segfault which could be trapped by a debugger? Or some kind of virtualisation? Or are the bugs mostly race conditions that aren't accurately replicated this way?<br>

You could certainly catch some bugs that way (those due to core code and/or SW PMU drivers), but you wouldn't be able to hit bugs which rely on HW PMU drivers.<br>

Of the 20 bugs listed in the article, at least 8 require a HW PMU driver to be active to trigger.<br>

Do testdrives like that allow installing custom git kernels, rebooting if there's a crash, and capturing serial console output?  <br>
<p>
Maybe the answer is yes, especially with how Power machines seem to always have a VM-like layer between the hardware and the OS.  Otherwise though fuzzing tends to be a bad idea on systems you don't have local access or root permissions.<br>

Yea, agreed. It's far from perfect, but it's pretty unbeatable in how quickly you can get a fairly accurate picture of performance problems.<br>
<p>
My biggest annoyance is that call graphs are only usable if you a) recompile software using frame pointers  b) use dwarf mode which generates huge data files and isn't available on many existing systems c) use lbr mode which requires a new cpu, kernel and perf version...  I hate whoever made the decision to default gcc to not using frame pointers in newer gcc versions. I kinda see the point on x86-32 which is really register starved, but it's not that bad on 64bits and it makes debugging and profiling so much harder. <br>
Second to that comes the far too generic and thus hard to search name ;)<br>

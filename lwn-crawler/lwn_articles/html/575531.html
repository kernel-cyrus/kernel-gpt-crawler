The kernel's tracing functionality allows for the extraction of vast amounts of
information about how the system is operating.  In fact, so much
information can be produced that one quickly starts to look for ways to cut
down the flood.  For this reason, filters can be attached to tracepoints,
limiting the conditions under which the tracepoints will fire.  But the
current filter implementation is relatively inflexible and slow; it would
be nice to be able to do better.  A new patch set appears to do exactly
that by introducing yet another virtual machine into the kernel.
<p>
In truth, the virtual machine added by <a href="/Articles/575444/">Alexei
Starovoitov's patch set</a> is not entirely new; it is a version of the
Berkeley packet filter (BPF) machine which is <a
href="/Articles/437981/">used in the networking stack</a>.  The secure
computing (seccomp) functionality <a href="/Articles/475043/">also uses
BPF</a> to regulate access to system calls.  Alexei's idea is to apply BPF
to the question of deciding which tracepoints should fire, but he has taken
the idea rather further than his predecessors.
<p>
To begin with, the "extended BPF" implemented in his patch set rather
expands the capabilities of the BPF virtual machine.  That machine was
designed to be unable to damage the kernel; it only allows forward jumps to
guarantee that programs will not loop, has no pointer types, etc.  The
extended BPF machine operates rather differently.  The two registers
available in BPF have been expanded to ten.  Backward jumps are allowed
(for reasons that will be mentioned below).  Extended BPF programs can
manipulate pointers and call kernel functions.  In other words, there is
quite a bit more power available here than in previous versions of the BPF
machine.
<p>
These capabilities notwithstanding, Alexei claims that extended BPF
programs are entirely safe to load into the kernel; he has gone as far as
to <a href="/Articles/575542/">suggest</a> that unprivileged users could
eventually be allowed to insert extended BPF programs into the kernel.  To
ensure this safety, the kernel performs a range of checks on every program
before accepting it.  Every jump is mapped and, while backward jumps are
allowed, jumps to previously executed parts of the program are not, so
loops should not be possible.  Execution of the program is simulated with
an in-kernel static analysis tool that tracks the contents of every
register; pointer operations are only allowed if it is known that the
pointer destination is meant to be accessible.  Kernel functions can be
called, but only those that have been explicitly made available to BPF
programs running in that particular context.  The total length of the
program is limited, as are various resources used or declared by the
program.  And so on.
<p>
The BPF machine implements a simple sort of assembly language, which, while
adequate for the creation of the sort of simple program it is intended for,
is not necessarily convenient for users to write in.  Users will not need
to worry about such problems with Alexei's mechanism, since there are
backends for both GCC and LLVM that allow filter code to be written
in a restricted form of&nbsp;C.  The GCC backend is available from <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpf_gcc/commit/9e7223f8f09c822ecc6e18309e89a574a23dbf63">a
GitHub repository</a>, while the LLVM version is in the LLVM tree itself.
This feature, incidentally, is why extended BPF allows backward jumps: the
compilers will emit them as a result of their optimization work.
<p>
The extended BPF machinery is not specific to any particular use within the
kernel.  Instead, it is meant to be invoked from a specific kernel
subsystem with a context describing the set of available functions and any
use-specific data.  So, for packet filtering, that context might include
the packet under consideration.  In the case of tracing, the context is a
subset of the processor's register contents when the tracepoint is hit.  So filters
must have a knowledge of which data structures will be in which registers —
information which may not be readily available, especially for users who
don't want to dig through the source code.  This aspect has been
acknowledged as one of the weakest points of the current implementation; it
will likely be improved before this functionality is considered for merging.
<p>
A simple example provided with the patch set looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    /*
     * tracing filter example
     * if attached to /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/net/netif_receive_skb
     * it will print events for loobpack device only
     */
    #include &lt;linux/skbuff.h&gt;
    #include &lt;linux/netdevice.h&gt;
    #include &lt;linux/bpf.h&gt;
    #include &lt;trace/bpf_trace.h&gt;
    
    void filter(struct bpf_context *ctx)
    {
    	char devname[4] = "lo";
    	struct net_device *dev;
    	struct sk_buff *skb = 0;
    
    	skb = (struct sk_buff *)ctx-&gt;regs.si;
    	dev = bpf_load_pointer(&amp;skb-&gt;dev);
    	if (bpf_memcmp(dev-&gt;name, devname, 2) == 0) {
    	    char fmt[] = "skb %p dev %p \n";
    	    bpf_trace_printk(fmt, sizeof(fmt), (long)skb, (long)dev, 0);
    	}
    }
</pre>
<p>

This filter code derives the address of the <tt>sk_buff</tt> from the
passed-in context (it's in the "rsi" register), uses that to load the
pointer to the associated <tt>device</tt> structure, then compares the
device name stored therein against the 
loopback device name, finally outputting a trace message if the comparison
succeeds. 
<p>
On supported architectures, the BPF code is compiled to native machine code
once it is accepted into the kernel.  So one might expect it to be fast.
Alexei ran a test on a networking tracepoint that would be hit one million
times; the filter program was designed to reject all tracepoint hits, on
the theory that filters will usually filter things out most of the time.
The BPF filter was notably faster than the kernel's current filter
mechanism, working through one million calls in about 2/3 of the time.
Interestingly, is was also quite a bit faster than tracing with no
filtering at all; the cost of running the filter was quite a bit less than
the cost of generating the trace output.
<p>
Ingo Molnar <a href="/Articles/575547/">looked at the patch set</a> and
came to a simple conclusion: "<q>Seems like a massive win-win scenario
to me.</q>"  He did have one concern, though: he wants the ability to
extract BPF programs from the kernel and turn them back into some sort of
useful source form.  This would, he said, make the licensing of BPF
programs clear:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I think it would be fundamentally important to make sure that this
	is all within the kernel's license domain, to make it very clear
	there can be no 'binary only' BPF scripts.
<p>
	By up-loading BPF into a kernel the person loading it agrees to
	make that code available to all users of that system who can access
	it, under the same license as the kernel's code (or under a more
	permissive license).
</div>
<p>
Others expressed concerns about the security of the system; Andi Kleen <a
href="/Articles/575548/">pointed out</a> that "safe" virtual-machine systems
have proved to have holes in the past, and that this one probably does as
well.  
<p>
Beyond security, there are a number of questions to be answered before this
patch set is likely to make it into the kernel.  The register-oriented
interface for access to relevant data seems awkward at best.  It's not
clear whether BPF filters should replace normal tracepoint output, or just
decide whether that output should happen.  There is also the question of
how this functionality relates to the <a href="/Articles/551314/">Ktap
mechanism</a>; the addition of two independent virtual machines for tracing
seems like an unlikely prospect.  But this work has clearly generated a lot
of interest, so answers to these questions may well be forthcoming.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Kleen targets run time checked VM (as java). But there are other solutions such as proof carrying code. Ie, generate a proof along with code given some public safety policy. The kernel only needs to verify that the proof and code are valid, and can then run without any runtime checks.<br>
<p>
And part of the research almost 20 years ago was applying it to network packet filters ;). There might be a reason it never catched on?<br>

Maybe because at least part of the proof-checking would be architecture-specific? If you are going to provide the kernel native machine code, along with a safety proof, then while part of the kernel's proof checker could be shared across architectures, it will need some architecture-specific code to understand the instructions, registers, etc. An interpreted virtual machine will work on any architecture. (Of course, one could always add a JIT later, which would become architecture-specific, but you still have the interpreter as a fallback for those architectures on which the JIT is not yet implemented.)<br>
<p>
Any VM is likely to have a simpler instruction set than many native architectures. So the amount of work in implementing one VM is likely simpler than implementing the proof checking for a single architecture.<br>
<p>
VMs are well understood technology. Proof generation and checking is much more esoteric.<br>

Static proof for simple functions is possible, but any functions that may be called fall outside that regime. You have to guarantee that each of those functions handles *any* argument passed to them correctly and that this remains so *indefinitly*.<br>
<p>
So if one of those functions has an unsafe check that's optimized away by the compiler, you're screwed. No checking of the source program will protect against that.<br>

If emitting backward jumps is a compiler limitation, can the compilers be improved?  It seems wiser for the compiler to re-order it than force the kernel to check it.  The compiler would only do this for acyclic code targeted at BPF, obviously.  Every directed acyclic graph (in this case, the BPF control-flow graph) does have such an ordering: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting</a><br>

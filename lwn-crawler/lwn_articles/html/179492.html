<h1>tee() with your splice()?</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted April 11, 2006 by corbet]

               </div>

<div class="ArticleText">
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/178199/">new <tt>splice()</tt> system
call</a> was covered here last week.  As was predicted then, this new
kernel API has continued to evolve; many of the non-fix patches going into
the post-2.6.17-rc1 mainline involved changes to <tt>splice()</tt>.
<p>
For starters, the prototype of the <tt>splice()</tt> system call has
changed:
<p>
<pre>
    long splice(int fd_in, loff_t *off_in, int fd_out, loff_t *off_out,
                size_t len, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The two offset values (<tt>off_in</tt> and <tt>off_out</tt>) are new; they
indicate where each file descriptor should be positioned prior to beginning
the transfer of data.  Note that these offsets are passed via pointers;
user space can use a <tt>NULL</tt> pointer to indicate that the current offset
should be used.  Note also that these offsets do not work like the
offsets in <tt>pread()</tt> or <tt>pwrite()</tt>: they will actually change
the offset associated with the file descriptor.  Providing an offset for a
file descriptor associated with a pipe is an error.
<p>

Internally, the <tt>splice()</tt> code has seen a couple of interesting
changes.  One of them (in the regular pipe code, actually) is the creation
of a new <tt>pipe_inode_info</tt> structure to represent the core machinery
behind a pipe.  This structure can stand apart from the normal
<tt>inode</tt> structure.  Many of the internal interfaces have been
changed to use the new structure, including the new methods in the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t (*splice_write)(struct pipe_inode_info *pipe, 
                            struct file *out, size_t len, 
			    unsigned int flags);
    ssize_t (*splice_read)(struct file *in, struct pipe_inode_info *pipe, 
                           size_t len, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
Since there are still few implementations of these methods in the kernel,
the changes are not particularly disruptive.
<p>

Next in the list is support for directly splicing two file descriptors
where neither is a pipe.  This functionality is not (yet) available to user
space via <tt>splice()</tt>, but it is used internally to implement
<tt>sendfile()</tt> with the <tt>splice()</tt> mechanism.  The direct
splicing is implemented using a hidden <tt>pipe_inode_info</tt> structure
(i.e. a pipe); it is stored in the new <tt>splice_pipe</tt> field of the
task structure, so each process can only have one such connection running
at any given time.
<p>

One patch which has not been merged - and will likely wait until 2.6.18 at
this point - is <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/179434/">the 
<tt>tee()</tt> system call</a>: 
<p>
<pre>
    long tee(int fdin, int fdout, size_t len, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
This call requires that both file descriptors be pipes.  It simply connects
<tt>fdin</tt> to <tt>fdout</tt>, transferring up to <tt>len</tt> bytes
between them.  Unlike <tt>splice()</tt>, however, <tt>tee()</tt> does not
consume the input, enabling the input data to be read normally later on by the calling
process.  Jens Axboe provides an example implementation of the user-space
<tt>tee</tt> utility, which comes down to a couple of calls:
<p>
<pre>
    len = tee(STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, INT_MAX, SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK);
    splice(STDIN_FILENO, out_file, len, 0);
</pre>
<p>
The input data will be written both to the standard output and the file
represented by <tt>out_file</tt> without ever being copied to or from user
space. 
To be sure of copying the entire input data stream, the application must
perform the above calls within a loop, of course; see the full example at
the end of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/179434/">the <tt>tee()</tt>
patch</a>. 
<p>
This call is quite new, and may well change before it makes it into the
mainline.  Among other things, it might get a new name, since something as
simple as <tt>tee()</tt> may already be in use in a number of
applications.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Why not just have tee()'s non-consumption of input behavior simply be<br>

      Because then you want to outputs at least, otherwise you'd end up with a new pipe just containing what you consumed. Not very interesting. And it was decided that the semantics of a one -&gt; one tee was more appropriate than a one -&gt; two where the input is consumed.<br>
<p>
With the current tee, you can think of it as simply a pipe dupe with memcpy() like semantics.<br>

      I'm not sure I understand why it would have to be any different internally...<br>
I understand what tee() is doing, but I was just saying why not have a new<br>
flag to splice() specify doing exactly that, rather than add a new syscall<br>
to do it...  Then, your example code that does tee() followed by splice(),<br>
would instead just do two separate splice() calls...  But, internally,<br>
splice() could do the same thing tee() does (when the hypothetical new flag<br>
is set), couldn't it?  Or, is there some internal implementation trickery<br>
that I'm completely missing?  (Or, is it just that it seems unclean to add<br>
such behavior to splice()?  Ie: splice() should always be expected to<br>
consume the input, and you don't want break that assumption, even with a<br>
special flag?)<br>

      I really am not sure of the answer to your question, but it made me wonder why not have Linux just have one system call "function()" and simply call it with a different flag depeding on whether we want to read or write or chmod etc. function(READ, fd, buff, bytes) to read, function(WRITE, fd, ...) to write, etc.<br>
<p>
Or if we just had to have 2, then "function" and "ioctl" (that's my vote).<br>
<p>
If 3: "function" "ioctl" and "read." In particular, read(WRITE, fd, ...) for opening a file, read (OPEN, ...) for duplicating a file descriptor, read (IOCTL, ...) for closing a network connection, function(READ, ...) for reserving memory, and function (CHMOD, ...) for shutting the system. Everything else should be doable with ioctl(..).<br>
<p>
Cool! We should suggest this on the mailing lists!!!<br>
<p>
[On a serious note, splice and tee may be related; for example, splice(WITH_TEE) might just increment counters beyond 1 and add ptrs to some linked list, etc. I don't really know. Maybe. But what really concerns me is your desire to do away with system calls.]<br>

<p>
This seems like an unfortunate limitation to me... As sendfile is now using splice, it means every process can only have one sendfile going at a given time? I hope I just misunderstood something... Think about web servers with possibly hundreds of threads all wanting to do sendfile.<br>

       The task struct is for tasks, not processes. The article was misleading. A thread is a task, as is a process. So each thread/process can only have one sendfile() running at once (which is basically how it is now -- at least I'm assuming they don't mean one sendfile over all open fds, which would make it worthless).<br>

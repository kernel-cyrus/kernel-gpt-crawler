The "QuadRooter"
vulnerabilities are currently making lots of headlines, at least partly
because they could impact up to 900 million Android devices.  There are
four separate bugs, each with its own CVE number.  Interestingly, all are
found in code that lives outside of the mainline kernel—but is obviously
shipped in a lot of devices.
</p>

<p>
QuadRooter, which was <a
href="http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/08/07/quadrooter/">announced</a> with
great fanfare by Check Point Software 
Technologies, consists of privilege escalation vulnerabilities that could
be used by malicious apps to take control of an Android device—and, of
course, the 
personal data stored on it.  The four bugs were found in drivers for
Qualcomm system-on-chips (SoCs) that are found in many Android phone
models, including the flagship Google Nexus 5X, 6, and 6P handsets.  The
bugs are serious, but users can mitigate the risk somewhat by avoiding
dubious apps.
</p>

<p>
The bugs are detailed in a <a
href="https://www.checkpoint.com/resources/quadrooter-vulnerability-enterprise/">report
[registration required]</a> from Check Point.  Note that unchecking the
"please send me email" box on the registration form does not actually seem
to stop Check Point from sending emails.  The vulnerabilities are found in three
different subsystems of the Qualcomm kernel: the ipc_router interprocess
communication (IPC) module, the ashmem shared-memory allocation subsystem,
and two bugs in the kernel graphics support layer
(kgsl) that is used to render graphics provided by user-space programs.
None of those modules is in the mainline kernel, though ashmem is in the
staging tree but that version does not contain the function that caused
the vulnerability.

</blockquote>
<p>
For the most part, the bugs themselves are fairly standard kinds of flaws.
The two in kgsl are use-after-free vulnerabilities, the ashmem bug provides
a way to get attacker-controlled data into the kernel,
 while the ipc_router bug is a memory corruption that
can lead to code execution.  It is noteworthy that, because the code is out
of the mainline, it probably didn't get the attention, testing, fuzzing,
and review that it might otherwise have received—from the kernel
development community, anyway.  Given its
prevalence in Android devices, though, it did garner some amount of
attention, from Check Point, at least, and perhaps from others who are far
less likely to report on what they found.
</p>

<p>
A look inside the flaws is instructive. <a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2059">CVE-2016-2059</a>
is the ipc_router code-execution bug.  The module provides a new address
family (<tt>AF_MSM_IPC</tt>) that can be used to create sockets.  Users can
convert "client" sockets to "control" sockets by way of an <tt>ioctl()</tt>
call.  Unfortunately, the conversion function locks the wrong list, which
allows (malicious) callers to corrupt a different list.  Elements on that
list can be made to point to freed memory, which the attacker can control
using "<a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_spraying">heap
spraying</a>".
</p>

<p>
The report goes into some detail on how that corruption can be used to call
arbitrary kernel functions with attacker-controlled parameters, which makes
for interesting reading.  But the upshot is clear: root privileges can be
gained and SELinux disabled, which gives the attacker complete control over
the device and its contents.
</p>

<p>
The first of the kgsl bugs (<a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2503">CVE-2016-2503</a>)
is caused by a race condition in the function
used to destroy a "syncsource" object in the kgsl_sync subsystem, which synchronizes graphics data between
user space and the kernel.  If two or
more threads 
call the function with the same syncsource, the reference count can be
decremented incorrectly, leading to a negative count.  That will allow
attackers to control the memory contents of the object that the kernel
still thinks is in use, which can then be used to execute code of the
attacker's choosing.  The recent <a href="/Articles/693038/">reference
count hardening</a> work might help avoid reference-count underflows like this.
</p>

<p>
The second kgsl use-after-free (<a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2504">CVE-2016-2504</a>) vulnerability
is even easier to trigger.  There is an <tt>ioctl()</tt> that allows users (or
attackers) 
to directly free a specific <tt>kgsl_mem_entry</tt> object by its ID
number, without any access control, which 
means that another thread can free the object while the kernel still has a
reference to this newly freed object. 
The usual use-after-free games can be played at that point. 
</p>

<p>
The bug (<a
href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5340">CVE-2016-5340</a>)
in ashmem, which is a memory allocator that allows processes to
easily share memory, is a bit different.
The Qualcomm version of ashmem has diverged from the one in staging, with
some new functions provided to access the <tt>struct&nbsp;file</tt> from a
file descriptor as long as the file is an ashmem shared-memory file.  But
the <tt>is_ashmem_file()</tt> function simply tests if the file name is
<tt>/ashmem</tt>, which is the file name used by the subsystem.
However, a, perhaps obscure, deprecated <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html">feature</a> of Android,
to allow for large files that accompany an app's <tt>.apk</tt> file, also allows
apps to mount a filesystem with an <tt>ashmem</tt> entry in the root:
<div class="BigQuote">
Attackers can use a deprecated feature of Android, called Obb to
create a file named <i>ashmem</i> on top of a file system. With this
feature, an attacker can mount their own file system, creating a
file in their root directory called "ashmem."
<p>
By sending the fd of this file to the <i>get_ashmem_file</i> function, an
attacker can trick the system to think that the file they created is
actually an <i>ashmem</i> file, while in reality, it can be any file.
</div>
<p>
Thus
a malicious app could fool the ashmem subsystem into using
attacker-controlled data in what it thinks is a file with contents that are
normally 
completely under its control.
</p>

<p>
Check Point has created a <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.checkpoint.quadrooter">QuadRooter
Scanner</a> app that is available in the Google Play store.  It scans an
Android device and reports which, if any, of the vulnerabilities affect
it.  There is <a
href="https://plus.google.com/+FranciscoFranco1990/posts/BR6NRSYFSrD">some
skepticism</a> about how good of a job it actually does, however.  On my
 Nexus&nbsp;6P, the scanner reports that the phone is vulnerable to
CVE-2016-2504 and CVE-2016-5340, which were not reported as fixed in the <a
href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2016-07-01.html">July
Android Security Bulletin</a>—the phone is updated with the
July&nbsp;5 update.
</p>

<p>
That would seem to indicate that a recently purchased flagship phone is
still vulnerable to two of the bugs, though the <a
href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2016-08-01.html">August
bulletin</a> does mention a fix for CVE-2016-2504, but there is no mention
of CVE-2016-5340.  That update has not been made available over Google's Project
Fi carrier as of yet, however. According to the report, Qualcomm was
informed about the bugs in April and it confirmed that it has released updated
code to OEMs.
</p>

<p>
But, as we have seen rather often in the Android world, those fixes are
taking some time to make their way out to users.  Even users of
Google's phones and network are awaiting some fixes.  Other carriers and
device makers tend to lag even further behind—or fail to ever get updates
out at all.  That leaves lots of phone
owners in a tricky spot.

<p>
Users who are not running random side-loaded apps are likely to be less
vulnerable to problems from QuadRooter, though.  That is not to say it is
impossible for a malicious app to slip into the Google Play store, but it
is definitely less probable.  The source of these kinds of malicious apps
will be some dodgy app store that promises to deliver the latest exciting
game or other app.  Users of vulnerable phones should steer clear of such
sites and generally try to be alert to odd behavior.  That's good advice
even well after QuadRooter is fixed on  phones, as there are
undoubtedly other, similar bugs lurking out there, both in the mainline and
various 
vendor kernels.

<p>The <a href="/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> subsystem allows
programmers to write programs that can run safely in kernel space. All
memory accesses and function calls in BPF programs are statically checked
for safety using the in-kernel verifier, which
analyzes programs in their entirety before allowing them to be loaded.
While this allows the kernel to safely run BPF programs, it heavily
restricts what those programs are able to do. Among these
constraints is a rule that programs cannot store pointers into BPF maps for
use (such as dereferencing them or passing them to the kernel in
<a href="/Articles/856005/">kfunc</a> and BPF helper invocations) at a
later time. A
<a href="/ml/bpf/20220424214901.2743946-1-memxor@gmail.com/">patch set by
Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi</a> adds this capability to BPF.

<h4>Interacting with kernel pointers in BPF programs</h4>

<p>Some operations are always safe to execute from within BPF. For example, the
<tt>bpf_probe_read_user()</tt> and <tt>bpf_probe_read_kernel()</tt>
helpers allow BPF programs to
safely read user and kernel memory respectively by registering a page-fault
handler to catch any faulting accesses. When BPF programs receive pointers
from event handlers, for example, they can safely dereference them without
having to worry about whether they will cause a crash, though they do
have to ensure that the read succeeded by checking the returned error code.

<p>BPF programs can also receive pointers from BPF helpers and
kfuncs. BPF helpers are functions defined in the  kernel that provide
the core APIs that can be invoked by any BPF program.
Kfuncs are also functions in the  kernel that can be invoked by BPF
programs but, unlike BPF helpers, their APIs do not need to be
applicable to all types of BPF programs. To make a function available to
BPF programs as a kfunc, it must be aggregated into one or
more <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/btf.html">BPF Type Format (BTF)</a>
kfunc-sets, which are then registered with the BPF subsystem.
<p>
Kfunc-sets
can also specify properties about their kfuncs that inform the verifier
about how they need to be invoked in order to ensure safe execution in BPF
programs.  One such property specifies that the kfuncs in a
kfunc-set will return an "acquired" pointer that must be passed to another
kfunc that is part of a kfunc-set that can release it.  Pointers that are
subject to this constraint are called "referenced pointers" within the BPF
community. 
<p>
When loading BPF programs, the verifier will enforce this contract, and
reject any program that fails to release a referenced pointer before
returning, or which passes a pointer that was not previously returned as
a referenced pointer to a BPF helper or kfunc.  Note that the implementation
of the "acquire" and "release" semantics of a kfunc is completely opaque to
BPF, and is entirely up to the developer implementing the kfunc. The only
thing that BPF requires is a guarantee that an acquired pointer will remain
valid until it is released.

<h4>Extending BPF usability with referenced pointers</h4>

<p>The ability to ensure that a kernel pointer is valid affords
several advantages to BPF programs. The first and perhaps most
straightforward is that BPF programs no longer need to use probed reads to
dereference the pointers. Probed reads use the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/exception-tables.html">exception
table</a>
mechanism used to safely read user memory from kernel space, and while they
have nearly the same performance as a normal load instruction for
successful reads, they impose a tax on the programmer by requiring them to
always check if a read was successful. Avoiding probed reads allows a
simpler programming model which can significantly cut down on the raw
amount of code needed in BPF programs to satisfy the verifier.

<p>In addition to providing simplification, referenced pointers also improve
the extensibility of BPF by allowing BPF programs to safely pass those
pointers back to the  kernel in subsequent kfunc and BPF helper
function invocations. While the  kernel could use a mechanism such as
<tt>copy_from_user()</tt> to read pointers received from BPF programs, it is less
complex and less error prone to, instead, provide a guarantee to the kernel
that pointers received from BPF programs are safe to read.  This guarantee
also makes it possible to export many internal kernel functions to BPF
programs without modifying them.

<p>While referenced pointers are a powerful tool for extending the
kernel using BPF, a
significant limitation of the feature is the requirement that all of the
interactions between BPF programs and kfuncs take place in a
synchronous context. Every time it needs to get a referenced pointer from
the kernel,
a BPF program must invoke a kfunc, and then release the pointer in another
kfunc invocation before returning. This may have performance implications,
as having to call two kfuncs is quite a lot of overhead relative to
performing a single memory read. This workflow is also somewhat orthogonal
to the traditional mechanics of reference counting, wherein pointers are stored in
a data structure with the intention of being safely accessed at a later
time. What would instead be useful is to store kernel pointers in a map, 
allowing them to be accessed whenever the program requires, possibly over
multiple separate calls.

<h4>kptrs – storing kernel pointers in BPF maps</h4>

<p>
Dwivedi's patch set adds this capability via a new feature called "kptrs". 
A kptr is a strongly typed pointer that is received from a kfunc
or BPF helper function and which may be stored into and retrieved from BPF
maps throughout the run time of a program. Kptrs may be either
ordinary ("unreferenced") or referenced pointers. Unreferenced kptrs have
no guarantee of validity and are highly restricted
in how they can be used; like normal pointers in BPF programs, they can only
be accessed using a probed read. They also cannot be passed to the 
kernel via a kfunc or BPF helper function, as the pointers may reference
invalid memory. Referenced kptrs, on the other hand, may be safely
dereferenced by BPF programs, and passed to the  kernel via kfunc or
BPF helper function invocations.

<p>From the BPF subsystem's point of view,
a referenced kptr always has exactly one reference associated with it. In
order to transfer a referenced kptr between different contexts, a new
<tt>bpf_kptr_xchg()</tt> helper function was
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/20220424214901.2743946-4-memxor@gmail.com/">added</a>
that atomically swaps ownership of the reference between a map value and a
local pointer. If the reference is transferred from a map value to a local
pointer, the semantics enforced by the verifier are the same as for
references returned by kfuncs in a synchronous context: the verifier will
ensure that the reference is either transferred back to a map value or
released via a call to a kfunc before the current execution context
returns. On the other hand, if the kptr reference is stored in a map, the
current execution context can safely return without releasing it.
<p>
If the
kptr is never transferred back out of the map with <tt>bpf_kptr_xchg()</tt> and
manually released, it will be automatically released when the program is
unloaded and the map is destroyed. In order to enable this automatic
releasing mechanism, Dwivedi
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/20220424214901.2743946-8-memxor@gmail.com/">extended</a>
the kfunc subsystem to allow developers to specify a kfunc destructor
function that should be used for a given type.

<p>Some of the
use cases for kptrs were discussed in an <a href="/ml/netdev/20220220134813.3411982-1-memxor@gmail.com/">earlier
revision</a>
of the patch set, with Dwivedi describing the most common one as being for
performance:

<blockquote class="bq">
	The common use case is caching references to objects inside BPF
	maps, to avoid costly lookups, and being able to raise it once for
	the duration of program invocation when passing it to multiple
	helpers (to avoid further re-lookups).
</blockquote>

<p>Storing a referenced kptr in a map obviates the
need to invoke
a kfunc every time the pointer is required, which provides performance
benefits and reduces complexity. BPF programs need only make an initial
kfunc invocation to first get the pointer and, after storing it in a map,
can simply load it from that map and
dereference it directly when it's needed.

<p>Referenced kptrs also provide strong safety and correctness guarantees
to developers. 
It is a ubiquitous paradigm in managed-object frameworks that a reference
should only be owned by a single context, and the semantics of kptr
reference handling bear a striking resemblance to
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html"><tt>std::boxed::Box</tt></a> in Rust,
and <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr"><tt>std::unique_ptr</tt></a>
in C++ in that regard. In Rust, a Box is a pointer to a heap allocation
that can only have a single reference at any given time, and which is
automatically freed when that reference goes out of scope. When the Rust
program is compiled, the Rust compiler will verify that only a single
reference can ever exist to the Box by applying Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">ownership
model</a>.
If the Rust program compiles, you have a guarantee that the memory pointed
to by a Box is always valid and only has a single reference. In C++,
some verification takes place at compile time by, for example, prohibiting
an <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt> from being copied, but problems can still arise at
run time. For example, a user could invoke
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/release"><tt>std::unique_ptr::release()</tt></a>
twice, and would receive a <tt>nullptr</tt> on the second invocation.

<p>Kptrs seem to draw inspiration from both languages. On the one hand, the
BPF verifier provides the compile-time guarantees that are
afforded by the Rust compiler by analyzing BPF programs to ensure that
there is only ever a single owner of a reference, and that the reference
can never be leaked. On the other hand, <tt>bpf_kptr_xchg()</tt> closely matches the
semantics of
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/swap"><tt>std::unique_ptr::swap()</tt></a>,
so the mechanics of using the feature will feel more like
C++. Managed-object leaks and use-after-free bugs are a common and
pervasive source of pain 
when correct accounting is the responsibility of individual developers.
Providing the guarantees of Rust's ownership model, and the semantics of
C++'s <tt>std</tt>::unique_ptr APIs, to C and kernel development using BPF and the
verifier therefore seems powerful indeed.

<p>It will be interesting to see if the advantages afforded by these features
will motivate more development to take place in BPF as opposed to the 
kernel.

<h4>Future kptr types</h4>

<p>While we have been referring to both unreferenced kptrs and referenced
kptrs as just "kptrs", they are actually represented as two different types
in BTF. If BPF programs wish to use a kernel pointer as an unreferenced or
a referenced pointer, they must annotate it with the BTF type tag "<tt>kptr</tt>" or
"<tt>kptr_ref</tt>" respectively. It makes sense to enforce separate types for each
kptr variant, as the verifier needs to use BTF to know a kptr's type, and
then enforce its safe use accordingly.

<p>While the current implementation of kptrs only enables the unreferenced and
referenced variants, a natural question is whether the
implementation could be expanded to include other types of pointers as
well. In the first version
of the patch set, Dwivedi proposed adding variants for per-CPU and user-space
kptrs. Alexei Starovoitov
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/20220319183028.pwzaoz2qogek6nwz@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com">responded</a>
by asking what the use case was for storing per-CPU pointers in maps, but
<a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/20220319190409.7n3bkjdp67finojx@apollo">Dwivedi
did not have</a> a
concrete use case in mind. It was
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/20220319212620.vbzfxsn2xitkzv5t@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/">decided</a>
to drop the feature until a more concrete use case appears, so
for now we will have to wait and see if that happens

<p>
This patch set is currently in linux-next, and so will presumably be merged
during the next development cycle.
In the meantime, it will be interesting to see how kfuncs and kptrs will be
used to extend the kernel in ways that currently are not possible with

`bpf_kptr_xchg()` also bears a striking resemblance to `std::mem:: replace` in rust.<br>

I can&#x27;t get away from some odd Rusty feelings here.<br>
<p>
Is it `std::mem::swap`? <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.swap.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.swap.html</a><br>
<p>
And &#x27;probe read&#x27; is oddly similar to `Option.unwrap_or...` functions, you need to carefully &#x27;extract&#x27; value from Option before you can use it.<br>
<p>
Whole &#x27;single ownership&#x27; model is visible here. And `must_use` attribute is here too. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/diagnostics.html#the-must_use-attribute">https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/diagnostic...</a><br>
<p>
Nevertheless, reference pointers are even more strict, because you can&#x27;t use `drop` for them. Should Rust consider such types too? Linear, I believe?<br>

<p>
Yes, that&#x27;d be linear types. However, in Rust it is safe to not call Drop on a type (i.e., you cannot rely on Drop for your type&#x27;s safety guarantees), so linear types would be something completely new. It comes up occasionally, but I doubt they&#x27;d be something that could be added at this point.<br>

I fantasized a bit how linear types may look like in Rust. The obvious idea is opting out of Drop trait (like with `?Sized`). If you have a type which has no &#x27;Drop&#x27; trait, it can&#x27;t be `dyn`&#x27;ed, and compiler may enforce that type without &#x27;Drop&#x27; trait must be passed to &#x27;somewhere else&#x27;. In this &#x27;somewhere else&#x27; there is unsafe (?) section which transmute type from not having Drop to having it.<br>
<p>
So, from code user perspective it would be like:<br>
<p>
fn create_linear&lt;T&gt; (...) -&gt; T, where T: ?Drop;<br>
<p>
and<br>
<p>
fn use_linear&lt;T&gt;(t: T);<br>
<p>
<p>
// I&#x27;m not even close to be a Rust developer so I don&#x27;t know if this sound or not. But idea if that `?Drop` if type live till the end of scope, that&#x27;s an error.<br>

I like the idea, some kind of explicit drop trait. <br>
<p>
However what about moving the value to a static variable and basically forgetting it?  Or RC cycle?  Or move to a thread which deadlocks or just loops forever?<br>
Or move everything else to a new thread and spin forever on the current thread?<br>
<p>
<p>
I think these are the kind of issues drop ran into.<br>

      This is (or, at least, was) a pretty common request; <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/linear-rust/">Gankra's blog post</a> is the last thing I remember seeing about it.
<p>
The summary is roughly “this is easy to implement in the compiler, but would require wide ecosystem changes to be usable, and any reasonable implementation will still have dynamic checks so maybe it's not worth it?”

I suppose one would need to be able to compile and bundle BPF code for inclusion in the kernel image and with automatic loading.<br>

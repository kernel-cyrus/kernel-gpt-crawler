<p> The Linux kernel has never lacked for synchronization primitives and
locking mechanisms, so one might justifiably wonder why there might be a
need to add another one.  The addition of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200527201119.1692513-1-bigeasy@linutronix.de/">local
locks</a> to 5.8 provides an answer to that question.  These locks,
which have their origin in the realtime (<tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt>) tree, were
created to solve some realtime-specific problems, but they also bring some
much-needed structure to a common locking pattern used in non-realtime
kernels as well.

<h4>Lock types in Linux</h4>

<p>The Linux kernel offers developers a number of lock types to choose
from. They could be roughly divided, until recently, into two categories:
spinning and sleeping locks.</p>

<p>A kernel function attempting to acquire a spinning lock that is
owned by another thread will 
spin (loop actively) until the other thread, which must be running on a
different CPU, releases the lock. This type of lock is fast, but it may
waste CPU cycles if the wait lasts for a long time. Spinning locks are thus
used around short sections
of code. Longer code sections protected by spinning locks will increase
the overall system latency; code that needs to respond to an event quickly
may be blocked on a lock. The category of spinning locks contains
spinlocks and read-write locks.</p>

<p>The situation is different with sleeping locks; a thread
taking such a lock will, as the name suggests, relinquish the CPU if it cannot
obtain the lock. This type of lock works for longer sections of
critical code, but  takes a longer time to obtain. Also,
sleeping locks cannot be taken when a thread is running in atomic
context; that happens, for example, when interrupts are disabled, the code
holds
a spinlock, or it holds an <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/29564/">atomic
kmap</a> (atomic kernel mapping).  In
non-<tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt> kernels, sleeping locks include all types of
mutexes and semaphores. 
In practice, even sleeping locks do spinning in some cases if there
is a possibility to obtain the lock rapidly. For example, mutexes
may spin if the mutex owner is running  (and thus should release the mutex
shortly).  This is called "opportunistic
spinning"; interested readers can look into the details in the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/mutex-design.html">kernel
documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The implementation of many lock types changes in
the <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt> kernels; in particular, most spinning locks becoming
sleeping locks.

<h4>Disabling interrupts and preemption as locking</h4>

<p>While not called "locking", another way of serializing access to certain
types of data exists in practice,
usually used in low-level code; it works by disabling interrupts,
preemption, or both.  These actions only apply to the running CPU.

<p>The Linux kernel is preemptive, meaning that a task can be stopped at
(almost) any moment to give the CPU to a higher-priority task.  Tasks may be
also moved to a different CPU at almost any time. Some code sections,
usually those dealing with 
per-CPU data, need to ensure that they run continuously on the same CPU
without interference from other tasks.
This code may not need a global
lock; since it only needs to modify per-CPU data, there should be no
possibility of concurrent access from elsewhere.  Such code can simply
disable preemption  with <tt>preempt_disable()</tt>,
restoring it with
<tt>preempt_enable()</tt>.  If the goal is to use
per-CPU data, additional helper functions exist; 
<tt>get_cpu()</tt>
disables preemption and returns the current CPU ID, and 
<tt>put_cpu()</tt> enables preemption.</p>

<p>Interrupts may be delivered to the CPU while a task is executing; that
too may cause unexpected concurrent access to per-CPU data.
To prevent this problem, the developer can disable interrupt
delivery with <tt>local_irq_disable()</tt> and then enable it with
<tt>local_irq_enable()</tt>. If the code is running in a context where
the interrupts might be already disabled, they should use
<tt>local_irq_save()</tt> and <tt>local_irq_restore()</tt>; this
variant saves and restores the previous status in addition to
disabling or enabling the interrupts. It is worth
noting that disabling interrupts also disables preemption.
While interrupts are disabled, the code is running in atomic context and the
developers need to be careful to avoid, among other things, any operations
that may sleep or call into the scheduler.</p>
<p>
These conventions for disabling preemption and interrupts are somewhat
problematic.  When a developer creates a lock, they (should) define exactly
what is protected by that lock.  Development tools like the lockdep checker
can then help to ensure that the locking rules are followed in all cases.
There <i>is</i> no lock when preemption disabling is used, though, and
often no clear idea of what is
being protected, making it easy for bugs to slip in.
<p>
The problems become more acute in the realtime setting.  The key
goal in a realtime kernel is that nothing must prevent the highest-priority
task from running immediately.  Disabling preemption can prevent the kernel
from making the CPU available to a process that needs it, and disabling
interrupts can delay the arrival of events that must be responded to as
quickly as possible.  The realtime developers have duly worked for many
years to prevent disabling either of those things whenever an alternative exists.


<h4>Introducing local locks</h4>

The solution to these problems is to create a new type of explicit lock,
called a "local lock".  On non-realtime systems, the acquisition of a local
lock simply maps to disabling preemption (and possibly interrupts).  On
realtime systems, instead, local locks are actually sleeping spinlocks;
they do not disable either preemption or interrupts.  They are sufficient
to serialize access to the resource being protected without increasing
latencies in the system as a whole.

<p>The local-lock operations are defined as macros and they use the
<tt>local_lock_t</tt> type which, on non-realtime systems, only contains
useful data when lock debugging is enabled. The developer can initialize a
lock using <tt>local_lock_init()</tt>, then take the lock using
<tt>local_lock()</tt> and release it using <tt>local_unlock()</tt>.  To
also disable interrupts, the developer can use <tt>local_lock_irq()</tt>
and <tt>local_unlock_irq()</tt>.  Finally, another set of functions allows
disabling interrupts while remembering their previous state:
<tt>local_lock_irqsave()</tt> and <tt>local_unlock_irqrestore()</tt>.

<p>Local lock operations map into the preemption and interrupt
disabling in the following way:
<pre>
     local_lock(&amp;llock)             preempt_disable()
     local_unlock(&amp;llock)           preempt_enable()
     local_lock_irq(&amp;llock)         local_irq_disable()
     local_unlock_irq(&amp;llock)       local_irq_enable()
     local_lock_save(&amp;llock)        local_irq_save()
     local_unlock_restore(&amp;llock)   local_irq_restore()
</pre>

<p>The advantages of local locks for non-<tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt> configurations
is that they clarify what is actually being protected and
they allow for lock debugging, including static analysis and
runtime debugging with lockdep. This was not possible with direct
calls to disable preemption and interrupts. Having a clear scope 
allows better documentation of locking in the code, with different
local locks used in different parts of the code, instead of one set of
context-less functions.  In the realtime world, additionally, code holding a
local lock can still be preempted if need be, preventing it from blocking a
higher-priority task.

<p>With the addition of local locks, the lock nesting rules change
somewhat. Spinning locks can nest (when all other locking rules are
met) into all other types of locks (spinning, local, or sleeping).
Local locks can nest into sleeping locks.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Local locks have been merged for the 5.8 kernel, which means they
are available now. This is a welcome
addition, as it makes per-CPU locking have the same semantics as
the other locks. This should avoid some errors, and allow lockdep in
contexts where it was not possible to use before. In addition, it will make
the merging of the remaining <tt>PREEMPT_RT</tt> patches that much easier.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
&quot;code that needs to respond to an event quickly may be blocked on a lock&quot;: this statement is true whether your lock is spinning or sleeping (e.g. a mutex). And you solve this problem with thread priorities and priority inheritance.<br>
<p>
So.. the reason why spinning locks are problematic for real-time operating systems is a bit more subtle than that.<br>
<p>
Preemption must be disabled while acquiring a spinlock. This means that higher priority threads (including RT threads) cannot get scheduled during the whole period of a spinlock critical section (on that CPU). This means that if you have &quot;sufficiently large&quot; spinlock critical sections in your kernel, your RT threads latency will get badly affected.<br>
<p>
Non-spinning locks do not have this problem, because their critical sections can be preempted at will. Meanwhile, spinlocks must disable preemption because if a thread holding a spin lock got preempted, it will let a possibly huge number of other threads consume their entire time slice just spinning. <br>

      Nice overview, thanks!
<p>
Something's missing here though? The article says
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">
On realtime systems, instead, local locks are actually sleeping spinlocks; they do
not disable either preemption or interrupts. They are sufficient to serialize access
to the resource being protected without increasing latencies in the system as a whole.
</font>

<p>
But the examples from the linked patchset do things like
<pre>
+	struct squashfs_stream *stream;
+	int res;
+
+	local_lock(&amp;msblk-&gt;stream-&gt;lock);
+	stream = this_cpu_ptr(msblk-&gt;stream);
[...]
</pre>

So <em>something</em> must have been done here to avoid CPU migration of the task while it's in this new context? Or am I completely confused, and this is generally implied by any kind of locking? But that can't be true for mutexes for example?

      You don't need to prevent preemption or migration to safely use per-CPU data, you just have to ensure exclusive access to that data.  In throughput-oriented kernels, that exclusive access is indeed ensured by nailing the thread down on the CPU; it's a cheap way of doing things.
<p>
In the realtime world, though, the metric used to determine "cheap" changes, and monopolizing a CPU becomes expensive.  So local locks are used to protect per-CPU data with a sleeping spinlock instead.  A thread holding such a lock might indeed be migrated, and could find itself accessing data for the "wrong" CPU.  But that is rarely a problem; the purpose of per-CPU data is to spread out data to reduce contention.  The association with a specific CPU is not usually important.  The lock will prevent unwanted concurrency regardless of where the thread is running, so the access is safe.

<p>
No. Holding a local lock prevents a thread from being migrated on RT. That&#x27;s a property of the underlying &#x27;sleeping&#x27; spinlock. <br>
Otherwise the following code sequence would fail:<br>
<p>
local_lock();<br>

<p>
tl;dr; version: <br>
<p>
 - Genuine sleeping locks (*mutex*,  *semaphore*) never disable preemption, interrupts or migration independent of RT<br>
<p>
 - Regular spinning locks and local locks implicitly disable preemption (therefore migration) and possibly interrupts on !RT. On RT they are replaced with &quot;sleeping&quot; spinlocks which only disable migration<br>

 - Raw spinlocks implicitly disable preemption (therefore migration) and possibly interrupts independent of RT.<br>

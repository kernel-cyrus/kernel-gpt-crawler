           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 25, 2011</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, some 5400 non-merge changesets have been pulled into
the mainline kernel for the next release.  The initial indications are that
this development cycle will not have a huge number of exciting new
features, but there are still some interesting additions.  Among the
user-visible changes are the following:

<p>
<ul>

<li> There are two new POSIX clock types: <tt>CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM</tt> and 
     <tt>CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM</tt>; they can be used to set timers that
     will wake the system from a suspended state.  See <a
     href="/Articles/429925/">this article</a> for more information on
     these new clocks.
<p>
<li> The <a href="http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/qfq/">Quick Fair Queue
     packet scheduler</a> has been added to the network stack.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/437981/">just-in-time compiler for BPF packet
     filters</a> has been merged; only x86-64 is supported for now.
<p>
<li> There is a new networking system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int sendmmsg(int fd, struct mmsghdr *mmsg, unsigned int vlen,
                 unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
     It is the counterpart to <tt>recvmmsg()</tt>, allowing a process to
     send multiple messages with a single system call.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/420799/">ICMP sockets</a> feature has been
     merged; its main purpose is to allow unprivileged programs to send
     echo-request datagrams.
<p>
<li> Two new sysctl knobs allow the capabilities given to user-mode helpers
     invoked by the kernel to be restricted; see <a
     href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/17f60a7da150fdd0cfb9756f86a262daa72c835f">the
     commit</a> for details.
<p>
<li> The tmpfs filesystem has gained support for extended attributes.
<p>
<li> The Xen block backend driver (allowing guests to export block devices
     to other guests) has been merged.
<p>
<li> New hardware support includes:
     <p>

     </ul>
     <p>
     Also added to the staging tree is the user-space support code for the
     <a href="http://usbip.sourceforge.net/">USB/IP subsystem</a> which
     allows a system to "export" its USB devices over the net.
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Prefetching is no longer used in linked list and  hlist traversal;
     this may be the 
     beginning of a much more extensive program to remove explicit prefetch
     operations.  See <a href="/Articles/444336/">this article</a> for more
     information on the prefetch removal.

<p>
<li> There is a new <tt>strtobool()</tt> function for turning user-supplied
     strings into boolean values:
<p>
<pre>
    int strtobool(const char *s, bool *res);
</pre>
<p>
     Anything starting with one of
     <tt>[yY1]</tt> is considered to be true, while strings starting with
     one of <tt>[nN0]</tt> are false; anything else gets an -EINVAL error.  
<p>
<li> There is a whole series of new functions for converting user-space
     strings to kernel-space integer values; all follow this pattern:
<p>
<pre>
    int kstrtol_from_user(const char __user *s, size_t count, 
			  unsigned int base, long *res);
</pre>
<p>
     These functions take care of safely copying the string from user space
     and performing the integer conversion.
<p>
<li> The kernel has a new generic binary search function:
<p>
<pre>
    void *bsearch(const void *key, const void *base, size_t num, size_t size,
	          int (*cmp)(const void *key, const void *elt));
</pre>
<p>
     This function will search for <tt>key</tt> in an array starting at
     <tt>base</tt> containing <tt>num</tt> elements of the given
     <tt>size</tt>.
<p>
<li> The use of threads for the handling of interrupts on specific lines
     can be controlled with <tt>irq_set_thread()</tt> and
     <tt>irq_set_nothread()</tt>. 
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/436041/"><tt>static_branch()</tt> interface for
     the jump label mechanism</a> has been merged.
<p>
<li> The function tracer can now support multiple users with each tracing a
     different set of functions.
<p>
<li> The alarm timer mechanism - which can set timers that fire even if the
     system is suspended - has been merged.
<p>
<li> An object passed to <tt>kfree_rcu()</tt> will be handed to
     <tt>kfree()</tt> after the next read-copy-update grace period.  There
     are a lot of RCU callbacks which only call <tt>kfree()</tt>; it should
     be able to replace those with <tt>kfree_rcu()</tt> calls.
<p>
<li> The -Os (optimize for size) option is no longer the default for kernel
     compiles; the associated costs in code quality were deemed to be too
     high.  Linus said: "<q>I still happen to believe that I$ miss
     costs are a major thing, but sadly, -Os doesn't seem to be the
     solution.  With or without it, gcc will miss some obvious code size
     improvements, and with it enabled gcc will sometimes make choices that
     aren't good even with high I$ miss ratios.</q>"
<p>
<li> The first rounds of ARM architecture cleanup patches have gone in.  A
     number of duplicated functionalities have been consolidated, and
     support for a
     number of (probably) never-used platform and board configurations have
     been removed.
<p>
<li> The <tt>W=</tt> parameter to kernel builds now takes values from 1
     to&nbsp;3.  At the first level, only warnings deemed to have a high
     chance of being relevant; a full kernel build generates "only" 4800 of
     them.  At <tt>W=3</tt>, developers get a full 86,000 warnings to look
     at.  Note that if you want <i>all</i> of the warnings, you need to say
     <tt>W=123</tt>. 
</ul>
<p>

The merge window for this development cycle is likely to end on
May&nbsp;29, just before Linus boards a plane for Japan.  At that time,
presumably, we will learn what the next release will be called; Linus has
made it clear that he thinks the 2.6.x numbers are getting too high and
that he thinks it's time for a change.  Tune in next week for the
conclusion of this merge window and the end of kernel version number
suspense.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>Just curious, does the kernel have to work independently of any standard library?  The <tt>kstrtol_from_user</tt> function appears to be nearly identical to <tt>strtol</tt>(3) and even the <tt>bsearch</tt> kernel function has the exact same prototype signature as the CStdLib function of the same name.</p>

<p>Also, how much improvement is <tt>-Os</tt> <i>supposed</i> to have over, e.g. <tt>-O2</tt>?  My personal experience with code I write is that <tt>-Os</tt> binaries are not significantly smaller (or execute any faster).  I have read the <tt>gcc</tt> man page, but perhaps there's more to it than what the man page says. Thanks!</p>

For you first question, yes. The kernel does not link to any other library. Basically everything used by the kernel is defined by the kernel. Standard C libraries do too much that is not allowed in the kernel (like any floating point operations).<br>
<p>
The kstrtol_from_user() does much more than strtol. That "from_user" part is critical. It is accessing data from an untrusted source. It must be prepared for that address to segfault, and make sure it does not belong to something that the user should not be touching.<br>
<p>
For your second question, well, that's the point for switching back to -O2 :)  The idea was that a smaller kernel would have less pressure on the instruction cache and be a bigger win in performance. Anytime you take a miss in the instruction cache, the CPU must stall to retrieve the memory that contains the instructions. As CPUs are much faster than memory access, the less you miss instruction cache, the faster you run. But if the -Os is not affecting this much at all, there's no point in using it.<br>

I think that at some point during v4.x development, gcc -Os option was changed from producing smaller code without much performance hit to something that mainly aims at smaller code.  If I remember right, there was even a gcc bug filed by Mozilla devs about this as they thought it a regression...<br>

<p>
That actually had always been the aim, but the tuning was not so good.  For example, Mozilla was making some simple functions non-static that should have been static.  These functions were very simple, but they were used only once and they still had to be included in the final binary.  So GCC started being worried about including two copies of them and stopped inlining them.  (This was fixed by tuning inliner heuristics to detect the optimization opportunities coming from the inlining of such simple functions).<br>

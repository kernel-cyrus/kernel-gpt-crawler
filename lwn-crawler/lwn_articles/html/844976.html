           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 8, 2021</br>
           </div>
The kernel's CFS bandwidth controller is an effective way of controlling
just how much CPU time is available to each control group.  It can keep
processes from consuming too much CPU time and ensure that adequate time is
available for all processes that need it.  That said, it's not entirely
surprising that 
the bandwidth controller is not perfect for every workload out there.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210202114038.64870-1-changhuaixin@linux.alibaba.com/">This
patch set</a> from Huaixin Chang aims to make it work better for bursty,
latency-sensitive workloads.
<p>
The bandwidth controller only applies to "completely fair
scheduling" (CFS) tasks (otherwise known as "normal processes"); the CPU
usage of realtime tasks is handled by other means.  This controller provides two
parameters to manage the limits applied to any given control group:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <tt>cpu.cfs_quota_us</tt> is the amount of CPU time (in microseconds)
     available to the group during each accounting period.
<li> <tt>cpu.cfs_period_us</tt> is the length of the accounting period,
     also in microseconds.
</ul>
<p>
Thus, for example, setting <tt>cpu.cfs_quota_us</tt> to 50000 and
<tt>cpu.cfs_period_us</tt> to 100000 will enable the group to consume 50ms
of CPU time in every 100ms period.  Halving those values
(setting <tt>cpu.cfs_quota_us</tt> to 25000 and <tt>cpu.cfs_period_us</tt> 50000)
allows 25ms of CPU time every 50ms.  In both cases, the group has been
empowered to consume 50% of one CPU, but in the latter case that time will
come more frequently, in smaller chunks.
<p>
The distinction between those two cases is important here.  Imagine a
control group containing a single process that needs to run for 30ms.  In
the first case, 30ms is less than the allowed 50ms, so the process will be
able to complete its task without being throttled.  In the second case, the
process will be cut off 
after running for 25ms; it will then have to wait for the next 50ms period
to start before it can finish its job.  If the workload is sensitive to
latency, the bandwidth-controller parameters need to be set with care.
<p>
This mechanism works reasonably well for workloads that consistently
require a specific amount of CPU time.  It can be a bit more awkward,
though, for bursty workloads.  A given process may use far less than its
quota during most periods, but occasionally a burst of work may come along
that requires more CPU time than the quota allows.  In cases where latency
doesn't matter, making that process wait for the next period to finish its
work may not be a problem; if latency does matter, though, this delay can
be a real concern.
<p>
There are ways to try to work around this issue.  One, of course, is to
just give the process in question a quota that is large enough to handle
the workload bursts, but doing that will enable the process to consume more CPU
time overall.  System administrators may not like that result,
especially if there is money involved and only so much time is actually
being paid for.  The alternative would be to increase both the quota and
the period, but that, too, can increase latency if the process ends up
waiting for the next period anyway.
<p>
Chang's patch set enables a different approach: allow control groups to
carry over some of their unused quota from one period to the next.  A new
parameter, <tt>cpu.cfs_burst_us</tt>, sets the maximum amount of time that
can be accumulated that way.  As an example, let's return to the group with
a quota of 25ms and a period of 50ms.  If <tt>cpu.cfs_burst_us</tt> is set
to 40000 (40ms), then processes in that group can run for up to 40ms in a
given period, but only if they have carried over the 15ms beyond their normal
quota from previous periods.  This allows the group to respond to a burst
of work while still keeping it within the quota in the longer term.
<p>
Another way of looking at this situation is that, when
<tt>cpu.cfs_burst_us</tt> is in use, the quota is interpreted differently
than before.  Rather than being an absolute limit, the quota is an amount
of CPU time that is deposited into the group's CPU-time account every
period, with the burst value capping the value of that account.  Bursty
groups can save up a limited amount of CPU time in that account for when
they need it.
<p>
By default, <tt>cpu.cfs_burst_us</tt> is zero, which disables the burst
mechanism and preserves the previous behavior.  There is a sysctl knob that
can be used to disable burst usage across the entire system.  Another knob
(<tt>sysctl_sched_cfs_bw_burst_onset_percent</tt>) causes the controller to
give each group a given percentage of their burst quota at the beginning of
each period, regardless of whether that time has been accumulated in
previous periods.
<p>
The patch set comes with some benchmark results showing order-of-magnitude
reductions in worst-case latencies when the burstable controller is in
use.  This idea has been seen on the lists a few times at this point, both
in its current form and as separate implementations by <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180522062017.5193-1-xiyou.wangcong@gmail.com/">Cong
Wang</a> and <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/157476581065.5793.4518979877345136813.stgit@buzz/">Konstantin
Khlebnikov</a>.  It looks as if the biggest roadblocks have been overcome
at this point, so this change could find its way into the mainline as soon
as the 5.13 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Linux network QoS solves a similar problem.  QoS tackles how to share a network link equitably among many users.<br>
<p>
The CBQ and HTB are queuing disciplines attempting to solve the problem of having a single link between protocols needing guaranteed low latency but low traffic (eg, VoIP and interactive like ssh), tasks that need to a responsive link with uneven loads (eg, http), and that just need heaps of &quot;low grade&quot; bandwidth (eg, email).  They use ad hoc techniques like the ones described here, and mostly work on a good day - but sometimes don&#x27;t.  And they are computationally expensive.<br>
<p>
HFSC came later and solves the same problem.  It has a rigorous mathematical analysis behind it, delivers perfect results, and is computationally inexpensive.  The key turns out to be how you pose the problem.  Doing that in a way that allows you to come up with a robust solution is non-obvious, or at least I found it non-obvious.  Interesting, like the proposed solution here HFSC must also take into account what bandwidth was used and went unused in the past to determine what can be used the future.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately CPU scheduling and QoS are only similar, not identical.  QoS has the luxury of the application breaking the work it presents to the QoS scheduled into bite sized pieces - packets.  The QoS problem reduces to deciding which of these packets to send next, and when.  In CPU scheduling you have a number of tasks lining up to use the CPU that will run for an unknown amount of time.    The problem reduces to &quot;how long can I let this task run, before I interrupt it&quot;.  Nonetheless, I suspect they have one thing in common: in order to do their jobs well, the mathematical model behind them must be perfect.<br>

So there&#x27;s still the elephant in the room - how does it compare to MuQSS after these patches? In terms of latency/interactive performance that&#x27;s been consistently embarrassing CFS for a decade and a half now, and the only reaction seems to have been “ignore it and hope it goes away”.<br>

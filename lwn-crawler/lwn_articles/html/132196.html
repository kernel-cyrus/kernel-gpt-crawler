<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>KProbes is a debugging mechanism for the Linux kernel which can also be
used for monitoring events inside a production system. You can use it to
weed out performance bottlenecks, log specific events, trace problems etc.
KProbes was developed by IBM as an underlying mechanism for another higher
level tracing tool called DProbes. DProbes adds a number of features,
including its own scripting language for the writing of probe handlers.
However, only KProbes has been merged into the
standard kernel.
</p>


<p>In this article I will describe the implementation of
KProbes as present in the 2.6.11.7 kernel. KProbes heavily depends on
processor architecture specific features and uses slightly different
mechanisms depending on the architecture on which it's being executed. The
following discussion pertains only to the x86 architecture. This article
assumes a certain familiarity with the x86 architecture regarding
interrupts and exceptions handling. KProbes is available on the following
architectures however: ppc64, x86_64, sparc64 and i386.</P>

 
<p>A kernel probe is a set of handlers placed on a certain
instruction address. There are two types of probes in the kernel as of
now, called "KProbes" and "JProbes."  A KProbe is defined by a
pre-handler and a post-handler. When a KProbe is installed at a particular
instruction and that instruction is executed, the pre-handler is
executed just before the execution of the probed instruction. Similarly,
the post-handler is executed just after the execution of the probed
instruction.  JProbes are used to get access to a kernel function's
arguments at runtime. A JProbe is defined by a JProbe handler with the same
prototype as that of the function whose arguments are to be accessed. When
the probed function is executed the control is first transferred to the
user-defined JProbe handler, followed by the transfer of execution to the
original function. The KProbes package has been designed in such a way that tools for
debugging, tracing and logging could be built by extending it.</p>



<p>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/KProbesArchitecture.png" width=316 height=260
alt="[KProbes architecture]" align="right">
The figure to the right describes the architecture of
KProbes.  On the x86, KProbes makes use of the exception
handling mechanisms and modifies the standard breakpoint, debug and a few
other exception handlers for its own purpose. Most of the handling of the
probes is done in the context of the breakpoint and the debug exception
handlers which make up the KProbes architecture dependent layer. The
KProbes architecture independent layer is the KProbes manager which is used
to register and unregister probes. Users provide probe handlers in kernel
modules which register probes through the KProbes manager.</p>

<p>

<H3>KProbes Interface</H3>
<P>
The data structures and functions implementing the KProbes interface have
been defined in the
file <tt>&lt;linux/kprobes.h&gt;</tt>.
The following data structure describes a KProbe.</P>

<PRE>
struct kprobe {
    struct hlist_node hlist;                    /* Internal */
    kprobe_opcode_t addr;                       /* Address of probe */
    kprobe_pre_handler_t pre_handler;           /* Address of pre-handler */
    kprobe_post_handler_t post_handler;         /* Address of post-handler */
    kprobe_fault_handler_t fault_handler;       /* Address of fault handler */
    kprobe_break_handler_t break_handler;       /* Internal */
    kprobe_opcode_t opcode;                     /* Internal */        
    kprobe_opcode_t insn[MAX_INSN_SIZE];        /* Internal */
};
</PRE>

<P>
Let's first talk about registering a KProbe. Users can insert their own
probe inside a running kernel by writing a kernel module which implements
the pre-handler and the post-handler for the probe. In case a fault occurs
while executing a probe handler function, the user can handle the fault by
defining a fault-handler and passing its address in struct kprobe. The
prototypes for these are defined as below.</P>


<PRE>
typedef int (*kprobe_pre_handler_t)(struct kprobe*, struct pt_regs*);
typedef void (*kprobe_post_handler_t)(struct kprobe*, struct pt_regs*, 
              unsigned long flags);
typedef int (*kprobe_fault_handler_t)(struct kprobe*, struct pt_regs*, 
             int trapnr);
</PRE>

<P>
As can be seen the pre-handler and the post-handler both receive a
reference to the probe as well as the registers saved for the context in
which the probe was hit. These values can be used in the pre-handler or
post-handler or if required, they can be modified before returning control
to the subsequent instruction. This also means that the same handlers can
be used for multiple probe locations. The <tt>flags</tt> parameter is currently
unused. The <tt>trapnr</tt> parameter (for the fault handler function)
contains the exception number which
occurred while handling the KProbe. A user defined fault handler can return
0 to let KProbe handle the fault further. It returns 1 if it has handled
the fault and wants to let the execution of the probe handler continue.


<P> 
Note that currently the pre-handler cannot be <tt>NULL</tt> for a probe,
although the use of post-handler is optional. This is considered a bug
since there may be cases where the pre-handler may not be required but a
post-handler is needed. In such situations the user will still have to
define a pre-handler. 
Another bug (which can oops the kernel) is related to probes which are activated on the
<tt>ret/lret</tt> instructions.  Yet another bug is related to
probes activated on <tt>int3</tt> instructions.  All of these problems
should be fixed in the 2.6.12 release of the
kernel. However, these bugs can be easily avoided so they do not present
any serious issues for someone who wants to use KProbes immediately without
applying patches. 
<p>
The KProbe registration functions are defined as shown
below.</P>


<PRE>
int register_kprobe(struct kprobe *p);
int unregister_kprobe(struct kprobe *p);
</PRE>
 
 
<P>
The registration function takes a reference to the KProbe structure
describing the probe. Note that the user's module which registers the probe
should keep a reference to the structure until the probe is
unregistered. Since access to KProbes is serialized, a probe can be
registered or unregistered anytime except from inside the probe handlers
themselves, which will deadlock the system. This is because probe handlers
execute after the spinlock used for locking KProbes has been acquired. The same
spinlock is locked just before unregistering the probe. So if an attempt is
made to unregister a probe inside a probe handler the same path will try to
lock the spinlock twice. 
<p>
Multiple probes
cannot be placed on the same address as of now. However, a <a
href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111321506232570&w=2">patch</a>
has been submitted to the kernel mailing list which allows multiple probes
to be registered at the same address through another interface. It might be
included in the next release of the kernel. Until then, if such an attempt
is made <tt>register_kprobe()</tt> returns <tt>-EEXIST</tt>.</P>


<P>
JProbes are used to give access to a function's arguments at runtime. This
is achieved by providing a JProbe handler with the same prototype as that
of the function being probed. At runtime, when the original function is
executed, control is transferred to the JProbe handler after copying the
process's context. On return from the JProbe handler, the context  - consisting
of the process's registers and the stack - is restored, so any modifications
to the context of the process in the JProbe handler are lost. The execution
continues from the point at which the probe was placed with the original
saved state. A JProbe is represented by the structure given below.</P>


<PRE>
struct jprobe {
    struct kprobe kp;
    kprobe_opcode_t *entry; 	/* user-defined JProbe handler address */
};
</PRE>

<P>
The user places the address of the function which will handle this probe in
the <tt>entry</tt> field. The <tt>addr</tt> field in <tt>struct kprobe</tt>
should be populated with the address of the function whose arguments are to
be accessed. The functions used to register and unregister a JProbe are
given below.</P>


<PRE>
int register_jprobe(struct jprobe *p);
void unregister_jprobe(struct jprobe *p);
</PRE>

<P>
The JProbe handler which is written by the user should call
<tt>jprobe_return()</tt> when it wants to return instead of the
<tt>return</tt> statement. </P>


<H3>KProbes Manager</H3>

<P>
The KProbes Manager is responsible for registering and unregistering
KProbes and JProbes. The file <tt>kernel/kprobes.c</tt> implements the
KProbes manager. Each probe is described by the <tt>struct kprobe</tt>
structure and stored in a hash table hashed by the address at which the
probe is placed. Access to this hash table is serialized by the spinlock
<tt>kprobe_lock</tt>. This spinlock is locked before a new probe is
registered, an existing probe is unregistered or when a probe is hit. This
prevents these operations from executing simultaneously on a SMP machine.
Whenever a probe is hit, the probe handler is called with
interrupts disabled. Interrupts are disabled because handling a probe is a
multiple step process which involves breakpoint handling and single-step
execution of the probed instruction. There is no easy way to save the state
between these operations hence interrupts are kept disabled during probe
handling.</P> 


<P>
The manager is composed of these functions which are followed by a
simplified description of what they do. These functions are architecture
independent. A side-by-side reading of the code in
<tt>kernel/kprobes.c</tt> and these steps will clarify the whole
implementation.</P>


<DL>
<P><DT><TT>void lock_kprobes(void)</TT></DT>
<DD>Locks KProbes and records the CPU on which it was locked</DD></P>

<P><DT><TT>void unlock_kprobes(void)</TT></DT>
<DD>Resets the recorded CPU and unlocks KProbes</DD></P>

<P><DT><TT>struct kprobe *get_kprobe(void *addr)</TT></DT>
<DD>Using the address of the probed instruction,
 returns the probe from hash table</DD></P>

<P><DT><TT>int register_kprobe(struct kprobe *p)</TT></DT>
<DD>This function registers a probe at a given address. 
Registration involves copying the instruction at the probe
address in a probe specific buffer. On x86 the maximum instruction size is 16 bytes
hence 16 bytes are copied at the given address. Then it replaces the
instruction at the probed address with the breakpoint instruction.</DD></P>

<P><DT><TT>void unregister_kprobe(struct kprobe *p)</TT></DT>
<DD>This function unregisters a probe. It restores the original instruction
at the address and removes the probe structure from the hash
table.</DD></P>


<P><DT><TT>int register_jprobe(struct jprobe *jp)</TT></DT>
<DD>This function registers a JProbe at a function address. JProbes use the
KProbes mechanism. In the KProbe pre_handler it stores its own handler
setjmp_pre_handler and in the break_handler stores the address of
longjmp_break_handler. Then it registers struct kprobe jp->kp by calling
register_kprobe()</DD></P>


<P><DT><TT>void unregister_jprobe(struct jprobe *jp)</TT></DT>
<DD>Unregisters the struct kprobe used by this JProbe</DD></P>

</DL>


<H3>What happens when a KProbe is hit?</H3>

<P>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/KProbeExecution.png" width=430 height=229
alt="[Kprobe execution diagram]" align="right">
The steps involved in handling a probe are architecture dependent; 
they are handled
by the functions defined in the file
<tt>arch/i386/kernel/kprobes.c</tt>. After the probes are registered, the
addresses at which they are active contain the breakpoint instruction
(<tt>int3</tt> on x86). As soon as execution reaches a probed address the
<tt>int3</tt> instruction is executed, causing the control to reach the
breakpoint handler <tt>do_int3()</tt> in
<tt>arch/i386/kernel/traps.c</tt>. <tt>do_int3()</tt> is called through an
interrupt gate therefore interrupts are disabled when control reaches
there. This handler notifies KProbes that a breakpoint occurred; KProbes
checks if the breakpoint was set by the registration function of
KProbes. If no probe is present at the address at which the probe was hit
it simply returns 0. Otherwise the registered probe function is called.</P>

<br clear="all"
<H3>What happens when a JProbe is hit?</H3>

<P>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/JProbeExecution.png" width=430 height=300
alt="[JProbe execution diagram]" align="left">
A JProbe has to transfer control to another function which has the same
prototype as the function on which the probe was placed and then give back
control to the original function with the same state as there was before
the JProbe was executed. A JProbe leverages the mechanism used by a
KProbe. Instead of calling a user-defined pre-handler a JProbe specifies
its own pre-handler called <tt>setjmp_pre_handler()</tt> and uses another
handler called a <tt>break_handler</tt>. This is a three-step process.


<P>
In the first step, when the breakpoint is hit control reaches
<tt>kprobe_handler()</tt> which calls the JProbe pre-handler
(<tt>setjmp_pre_handler()</tt>). This saves the stack contents and the
registers before changing the <tt>eip</tt> to the address of the
user-defined function. Then it returns 1 which tells
<tt>kprobe_handler()</tt> to simply return instead of setting up
single-stepping as for a KProbe. On return control reaches the user-defined
function to access the arguments of the original function. When the user
defined function is done it calls <tt>jprobe_return()</tt> instead of doing
a normal return.</P>

 
 <P>In the second step <tt>jprobe_return()</tt> truncates the
 current stack frame and generates a breakpoint which transfers control to
 <tt>kprobe_handler()</tt> through
 <tt>do_int3()</tt>. <tt>kprobe_handler()</tt> finds that the generated
 breakpoint address (address of <tt>int3</tt> instruction in
 <tt>jprobe_handler()</tt>) does not have a registered probe however
 KProbes is active on the current CPU. It assumes that the breakpoint must
 have been generated by JProbes and hence calls the <tt>break_handler</tt>
 of the <tt>current_kprobe</tt> which it saved earlier. The
 <tt>break_handler</tt> restores the stack contents and the registers that
 were saved before transferring control to the user-defined function and
 returns.</P>

  
 <P>
In the third step <tt>kprobe_handler()</tt> then sets up single-stepping of
the instruction at which the JProbe was set and the rest of the sequence is
the same as that of a KProbe.


<H3>Possible problems</H3>

<P>
There could be several possible problems which could occur when a probe is
handled by KProbes. The first possibility is that several probes are
handled in parallel on a SMP system. However, there's a common hash table
shared by all probes which needs to be protected against corruption in such
a case. In this case <tt>kprobe_lock</tt> serializes the probe handling
across processors.</P>


<P>
Another problem occurs if a probe is placed inside KProbes code,
causing KProbes to enter probe handling code recursively. This problem is
taken care of in <tt>kprobe_handler()</tt> by checking if KProbes is
already running on the current CPU. In this case the recursing probe is
disabled silently and control returns back to the previous probe handling
code.</P>


<P>
If preemption occurs when KProbes is executing it can context switch to
another process while a probe is being handled. The other process could
cause another probe to fire which will cause control to reach
<tt>kprobe_handler()</tt> again while the previous probe was not handled
completely. This may result in disarming the new probe when KProbes
discovers it's recursing. To avoid this problem, preemption is disabled when
probes are handled.</P>


<P>
Similarly, interrupts are disabled by causing the breakpoint
handler and the debug handler to be invoked through interrupt gates rather than trap
gates. This disables interrupts as soon as control is transferred to the
breakpoint or debug handler. These changes are made in the file
<tt>arch/i386/kernel/traps.c</tt>.</P>


<P>
A fault might occur during the handling of a probe. In this case, if the
user has defined a fault handler for the probe, control is transferred to
the fault handler. If the user-defined fault handler returns 0 the fault is
handled by the kernel. Otherwise, it's assumed that the fault was handled
by the fault handler and control reaches back to the probe handlers.</P>



<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>
KProbes is an excellent tool for debugging and tracing; it can also be used
for performance measuring. Developers can use it to trace the path of their
programs inside the kernel for debugging purposes. System administrators
can use it to trace events inside the kernel on production systems. KProbes
can also be used for non-critical performance measurements. The
current KProbes implementation, however, introduces some latency of its own
in handling probes. The cause behind this latency is the single
<tt>kprobe_lock</tt> which serializes the execution of probes across all CPUs on a
SMP machine. Another reason is the mechanism used by KProbes which uses
multiple exceptions to handle a single probe. Exception handling is an
expensive operation which causes its own delays. Work needs to be done in
this area to improve SMP scalability and improving the probe handling time
to make KProbes a viable performance measuring tool.</P>


<P>
KProbes however cannot be used directly for these purposes. In the raw form
a user can write a kernel module implementing the probe handlers. However
higher level tools are necessary for making it more convenient to use. Such
tools could contain standard probe handlers implementing the desired
features or they could contain a means to produce probe-handlers given
simple descriptions of them in a scripting language like DProbes.</P>

      I second that Wow. Great article, especially considering it's Sudhanshu's first tech article.<br>

      Thorough as it might be, this article is simply too long for LWN. It would <br>
have been better placed on developerworks. An article that starts with <br>
"This is article assumes that you are familiar with..." doesn't belong in <br>
LWN, IMO. <br>
 <br>
Note: I didn't say the article was bad or something. All I say is that it <br>
appeared in the wrong publication. <br>

      On the one hand I have to agree with you. On the other hand LWN's kernel page usually assumes the reader is quite familiar with the Linux kernel's source - just without saying so.<br>

      I don't agree. I think that is a question of personal preference. I am not familiar with the kernel (and least not with implementation details). Still, I very much prefer to superificially glance over an in-depth article than reading a superficial article in depth.<br>

      "Thorough as it might be, this article is simply too long for LWN"<br>
<p>
I don't agree.  If an article needs to be long in order to cover the subject in the depth LWN readers have come to expect and appreciate, then so be it.  If your attention span is shorter than the article, just move on to the next article, it's your choice.<br>

Great article! Regarding "To avoid this problem, preemption is disabled when probes are handled.", to save the function parameters from a jprobe handler and use them in a kretprobe does this mean that the kretprobe handle is guaranteed to always be called right after the jprobe handler, without any interruption? Ie. Register a jprobe(sys_symlink) -&gt; handle_pre_symlink and a kretprobe(sys_symlink) -&gt; handle_post_symlink. If not, is it possible to match a jprobe handler to a kretprobe handler?<br>
<p>
    jprobe 1<br>
         jprobe 2<br>
         kretprobe 2<br>
    kretprobe 1<br>

Are you able to copy_from_user within a jprobe entry handler (where you have access to the system call's arguments)? If not, are there any techniques to bypass this restriction (ie. disabling interrupts) or another way to get memory from userspace while in this context?<br>

Reference counts are a commonly used mechanism for tracking the life cycle
of objects in a computing system.  As long as every user of an object
correctly maintains its references by incrementing and decrementing the
reference count, that object will persist for as long as it
is needed
and will be properly destroyed once the last user is done.  The "correctly"
in that sentence is important, though; things do not work
as well in the presence of reference-counting errors.  Networking
developer Eric Dumazet is working on <a href="/ml/netdev/20211205042217.982127-1-eric.dumazet@gmail.com/">a
reference-count tracking system</a> that could prove useful for finding
these errors in the networking subsystem and, someday, throughout the kernel.
<p>
Bugs in reference-count manipulation can be hard to find because the
references themselves are anonymous.  It may become clear, for example,
that some user of an object has failed to release a reference before
forgetting about that object, but there is generally no way to know
<i>which</i> user has done this.  So the kernel ends up with an unused object
that cannot be released, but there is no way to know where the
reference-counting mechanism failed, or even which reference was lost.  If
there were a way to determine which of (say) several dozen references to an
object was leaked, the task of finding the erroneous release path would be
made considerably easier.
<p>
Dumazet's patch set addresses this problem by creating a tracking mechanism
that essentially surrounds the use of reference counts.  The first step in
using reference-count tracking is to add the tracker itself, in the form of
a <tt>ref_tracker_dir</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct ref_tracker_dir {
    #ifdef CONFIG_REF_TRACKER
	spinlock_t		lock;
	unsigned int		quarantine_avail;
	refcount_t		untracked;
	struct list_head	list; /* List of active trackers */
	struct list_head	quarantine; /* List of dead trackers */
    #endif
    };
</pre>
<p>
This structure does not contain the reference count itself; instead, it is
added to the object that contains the reference count of interest.  The
first use is in the massive <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.16-rc3/source/include/linux/netdevice.h#L1690"><tt>net_device</tt>
structure</a> that, as one might expect, is used to manage network
devices.  These structures are referenced in many places in the networking
subsystem and are prone to reference-counting bugs; references are taken
and released so often that a bespoke, per-CPU reference-counting mechanism
is used.  One leaked reference is enough to prevent the removal of a
network device from the system; that, in turn, can block the clean-up of
containers or virtual machines.  To reduce the pain of finding these bugs,
Dumazet's patch set starts by adding a <tt>ref_tracker_dir</tt> structure
to <tt>struct net_device</tt>.  This structure is initialized (via a
required call to <tt>ref_tracker_dir_init()</tt>) with the
lists empty and <tt>quarantine_avail</tt> (to be discussed below) set
to a caller-supplied value.
<p>
For the reference-count tracking mechanism to work properly, every code
path that takes or releases a reference must also tell the tracker about
that action.  That is relatively easily done in settings where
reference-count manipulation is encapsulated within some other function;
otherwise a fair number of code changes may be required.  Whenever the code
takes a tracked reference to an object, it should  make a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int ref_tracker_alloc(struct ref_tracker_dir *dir, struct ref_tracker **trackerp,
			  gfp_t gfp_flags);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>dir</tt> argument points to the <tt>ref_tracker_dir</tt> structure
added to the reference-counted object.  This function will allocate a
<tt>ref_tracker</tt> structure to track this specific reference, using the
given <tt>gfp_flags</tt>, and storing its address in <tt>*trackerp</tt>.
The return value is zero or an error code (mostly likely <tt>-ENOMEM</tt>
if it is not possible to allocate the <tt>ref_tracker</tt> structure).
<p>
<tt>ref_tracker_alloc()</tt> will add the new structure to <tt>list</tt>
in the <tt>ref_tracker_dir</tt> structure, thus noting that a reference
has been taken.  To be useful, though, this tracker must somehow
make a note of <i>where</i> this specific reference was taken.  The name of
the function taking the reference would be useful, but often the real bug
is several layers up the call stack, so a bit more information is needed to
identify the real source of a problem.
The tracking mechanism uses a kernel debugging feature called "stackdepot",
which is able to generate and save full stack traces; stackdepot is
rigorously undocumented, but the source is in <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.16-rc3/source/lib/stackdepot.c"><tt>lib/stackdepot.c</tt></a>.
By storing the full stack trace, the tracking mechanism gains the ability
to shed light on the real source of reference-counting problems.
<p>
When a reference is released, a call must be made to:
<p>
<pre>
    int ref_tracker_free(struct ref_tracker_dir *dir, struct ref_tracker **trackerp);
</pre>
<p>
This function will do a number of things, starting by removing the tracker
pointed to (indirectly) by <tt>trackerp</tt> from <tt>list</tt>.  The
tracker is marked internally as having been released, but that structure is
not immediately freed; instead, it is added to the <tt>quarantine</tt>
list and the current stack trace is stored within it.  This is done to
catch double-free bugs; if 
<tt>ref_tracker_free()</tt> is called on a <tt>ref_tracker</tt> structure
that is marked as already having been released, an immediate report is
generated 
showing the stack traces associated with the allocation event and both free
events.
<p>
With busy objects, the <tt>quarantine</tt> list could easily grow
to great length, so the above-mentioned <tt>quarantine_avail</tt> count is
used to limit its length.  Whenever a tracker is added to
<tt>quarantine</tt>, the count is checked; if <tt>quarantine_avail</tt>
is zero, the oldest tracker on the quarantine list will be freed, otherwise
the count will be decremented.
The initial value of <tt>quarantine_avail</tt> is specified at
<tt>ref_tracker_dir</tt> initialization time; for network devices, it can
grow to 128 entries.
<p>
Double-free bugs can be caught immediately, but leaked references can only
be detected when the time comes to free the reference-counted object.  When
the kernel is instructed to remove a network device, it will wait until the
reference count on that device reaches zero; at this point, a leaked
reference makes itself known by blocking the operation until the system is
restarted.  By this time, of course, the information about which reference
has been leaked is long gone — at least, until the reference-count tracking
mechanism comes into play.  Any references taken to the object that were
never released will still have active <tt>ref_tracker</tt> structures
sitting around.  A simple call to <tt>ref_tracker_dir_print()</tt> will
cause the stack traces associated with any leaked references to be printed
to the system log.
<p>
The advantage of this mechanism is clear: it should be able to shine a
light on a reference-counting bugs, easing the process of debugging those
errors.  On the other hand, it is a fairly heavyweight mechanism that is
not suitable for production use.  The implementation also requires that
reference-count tracking be separately plumbed into every subsystem that
wants to use it, and the changes may not be small; 21 patches out of
Dumazet's 23-part series are dedicated to instrumenting <tt>struct
net_device</tt>.  A debugging mechanism transparently built directly into
the <tt>refcount_t</tt> type would potentially be more applicable and less
intrusive, but it wouldn't work with the one-off mechanism used with network
devices.
<p>
So this work is not, yet, a general-purpose reference-count debugging tool,
but it is a significant step in that direction.  The pieces are there
waiting for a sufficiently motivated developer to turn them into something
more general.  Meanwhile, what's there should help to reduce the number of
reference-counting bugs in the networking code, which is a good start.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

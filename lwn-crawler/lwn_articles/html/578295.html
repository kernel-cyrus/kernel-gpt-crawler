<a href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse">Jailhouse</a> is a new
hypervisor designed to cooperate with Linux and run 
bare-metal applications or modified guest operating systems. Despite this
cooperation, 
Jailhouse is self-contained and uses Linux only to bootstrap and (later)
manage itself. The hypervisor is free software released under GPLv2 by
Siemens; the Jailhouse project was <a href="/Articles/574274/">publicly
announced</a> in November 2013, and is
in an early stage of development. Currently, Jailhouse supports 64-bit x86
systems only; 
ARM support is on the roadmap, though, and, given that the code is
portable, we may see more architectures added to this list in the future. 
<p>
Linux has many full-fledged hypervisors (including KVM and Xen), so
why bother creating another one? Jailhouse is different. First of all, it
is a <i>partitioning</i> hypervisor that is more concerned with isolation than 
virtualization. Jailhouse is lightweight and doesn't provide many features
one traditionally expects from virtualization systems. For example, there is no
support for overcommitment of resources, guests can't share a CPU
because there is no scheduler, and Jailhouse can't emulate devices you
don't have. 
<p>
Instead, Jailhouse enables asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) on top
of an existing Linux setup and splits the system into isolated partitions
called "cells." Each cell runs one guest and has a set of assigned
resources (CPUs, memory regions, PCI devices) that it fully
controls. The hypervisor's job is to manage cells and maintain their isolation
from each other. This approach is most useful for virtualizing tasks that
require full control over the CPU; examples include realtime control tasks and
long-running number crunchers (high-performance
computing). Besides these, it can be used for security applications:
to create sandboxes, for example.
<p>
A running Jailhouse system has at least one cell known as the "Linux cell." It
contains the Linux system used to initially launch the hypervisor and
to control it afterward. This cell's role is somewhat similar to that of <a
href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Dom0">dom0 in 
Xen</a>. However, the Linux cell doesn't assert full control over hardware
resources 
as dom0 does; instead, when a new cell is created, the Linux cell cedes
control over some of its CPU, device, and memory resources to that new
cell. This process is called "shrinking".
<p>
Jailhouse relies on hardware-assisted virtualization features provided by
the target architecture; for Intel processors (the only ones supported as of
this writing) this means <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_.28VT-x.29">VT-x
and VT-d</a> support. 
These requirements make the hypervisor design clean, its code compact and
relatively simple;  the goal is to keep Jailhouse below 10,000 lines of code. 
Traditionally, hypervisors
were either large and complex, or intentionally simple if built for the
classroom. Jailhouse fits in between: it is a real product targeted at
production use that is small enough to cover in a two-part article series.
<p>
The easiest way to play with Jailhouse now is to run it inside KVM with
a simple bare-metal application, <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/inmate/apic-demo.c"><tt>apic-demo.bin</tt></a>
(provided with the Jailhouse 
source), as a guest. In this
case, VT-d is not used since KVM doesn't emulate it (yet). The <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/README">README file</a>
describes how to create this setup in detail; additional help can be found
in  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jailhouse-dev">the
mailing list archives</a>. 
<p>
Running Jailhouse on real hardware
is also possible, but is not very easy at this time. You will need to
describe the resources available to Jailhouse (a process covered in the
next section); a
good starting point for this is the contents of <tt>/proc/iomem</tt> in
your Linux 
system. This is an error-prone process, but hopefully this
article will provide enough insight into how Jailhouse works internally
to get it running on the hardware of your choice.
<p>
A good introduction to Jailhouse (including slides) can be found in <a
href="/Articles/574273/">the initial announcement</a>. We
won't reproduce it here but rather will dive straight into the hypervisor
internals.
<p>
<h4>Data structures</h4>
<p>
Before it can be used to partition a real system, the Jailhouse system must
be told how that system is put together.  To that end,
Jailhouse uses <tt>struct jailhouse_system</tt> (defined in <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/include/jailhouse/cell-config.h"><tt>cell-config.h</tt></a>)
as a 
descriptor for the system it runs on. This structure contains three fields:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>hypervisor_memory</tt>, which defines Jailhouse's location in memory;
<p>
<li> <tt>config_memory</tt>, which points to the region where hardware
     configuration is 
  stored (for x86, it's the ACPI tables); and
<p>
<li> <tt>system</tt>, a cell descriptor which sets the initial
     configuration for the Linux cell.
</ul>
<p>

A cell descriptor starts with <tt>struct jailhouse_cell_desc</tt>, defined in
<tt>cell-config.h</tt> as well. This structure contains basic information
like the 
cell's name, size of its CPU set, the number of memory regions, IRQ lines,
and PCI devices. Associated with <tt>struct jailhouse_cell_desc</tt> are several
variable-sized arrays which follow immediately after it in memory; these
arrays are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A bitmap which lists the cell's CPUs.
<p>
<li> An array which stores the physical address, guest physical address
     (<tt>virt_start</tt>), size, and access flags for this cell's memory
     regions. There can be many of these regions, corresponding to the
     cell's RAM (currently it must be the
     first region), PCI, ACPI, or I/O APIC, etc. See <a
     href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/config/qemu-vm.c"><tt>config/qemu-vm.c</tt></a>
     for an example.

<p>
<li> An array which describes the cell's IRQ
     lines. It's unused now and may disappear or change in the future.
<p>
<li> The I/O bitmap, which controls I/O ports accessible from the cell
     (setting a bit indicates that the associated port is
     inaccessible). This is x86-only, since no other 
     supported architecture has a separate I/O space.
<p>
<li> An array which maps PCI devices to VT-d domains.
</ul>
<p>

Currently, Jailhouse has no human-readable configuration files.  
Instead, the C structures mentioned
above are compiled with the "<tt>-O&nbsp;binary</tt>" <tt>objcopy</tt>
flag to 
produce raw binaries rather than ELF objects, and the <tt>jailhouse</tt>
user-space tool (see <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/tools/jailhouse.c"><tt>tools/jailhouse.c</tt></a>)
loads them into memory in that form. Creating such 
descriptors is tedious work that requires extensive knowledge of the hardware
architecture. There are no sanity checks for descriptors except basic
validation, so you can easily create something unusable. Nothing prevents
Jailhouse from using a higher-level XML or similar text-based configuration
files in the future — it is just not implemented yet.
<p>
Another common data structure is <tt>struct per_cpu</tt>, which is
architecture-specific and defined (for x86) in <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/arch/x86/include/asm/percpu.h"><tt>x86/include/asm/percpu.h</tt></a>. It
describes 
a CPU that is assigned to a cell. Throughout this text, we will refer to it
as <tt>cpu_data</tt>. There is one <tt>cpu_data</tt> structure for each
processor Jailhouse manages, 
and it is stored in a per-CPU memory region called <tt>per_cpu</tt>.
<tt>cpu_data</tt> contains information like the logical CPU identifier
(<tt>cpu_id</tt> field), APIC identifier (<tt>apic_id</tt>), the hypervisor
stack 
(<tt>stack[PAGE_SIZE]</tt>), a back reference to the cell this CPU belongs to
(<tt>cell</tt>), 
a set of Linux registers (i.e. register values used when Linux moved to
this CPU's cell), and the CPU mode (stopped, wait-for-SIPI, etc). It also holds
the VMXON and VMCS regions required for VT-x.
<p>
Finally, there is <tt>struct jailhouse_header</tt> defined in <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/include/jailhouse/header.h"><tt>header.h</tt></a>,
which 
describes the hypervisor as a whole. It is located at the very beginning of
the hypervisor binary image and contains information like the
hypervisor entry point address, its memory size, page
offset, and number of possible/online CPUs. Some fields in this
structure have static values, while the loader initializes the others at
Jailhouse startup.
<p>
<h4>Enabling Jailhouse</h4>
<p>
Jailhouse operates in a physically continuous memory region. Currently, this
region must be reserved at boot using the "<tt>memmap=</tt>" kernel command-line
parameter; future versions may use the <a
href="/Articles/486301/">contiguous memory allocator (CMA)</a> 
instead. When you enable Jailhouse, the loader linearly maps this memory
into the kernel's virtual address space. Its offset from the memory
region's base address is stored
in the <tt>page_offset</tt> field of the header. This makes converting from
host virtual 
to physical address (and the reverse) trivial.
<p>

To enable the hypervisor, Jailhouse needs to initialize its subsystems,
create a Linux cell according to the system configuration, enable VT-x on
each CPU, and, finally, migrate Linux into its cell to continue running in
guest mode. From this point, the hypervisor asserts full control over the
system's resources.

As stated earlier, Jailhouse doesn't depend on Linux to provide services to
guests. However, Linux is used to initialize the hypervisor and to control
it later. For these tasks, the <tt>jailhouse</tt> user-space tool issues
<tt>ioctl()</tt> commands to <tt>/dev/jailhouse</tt>. The
<tt>jailhouse.ko</tt> module (the loader), compiled from <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/main.c"><tt>main.c</tt></a>,
registers this device node when it is loaded into the kernel.

<p>
To start the sequence of events described above, the <tt>jailhouse</tt>
tool is used to issue a
<tt>JAILHOUSE_ENABLE</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> which
causes a call to <tt>jailhouse_enable()</tt>. It loads the hypervisor code into 
the reserved memory region
via a <tt>request_firmware()</tt> call. 
Then <tt>jailhouse_enable()</tt> maps Jailhouse's reserved memory region
into kernel space using <tt>ioremap()</tt> and marks its pages as
executable. The hypervisor  and a system configuration (<tt>struct
jailhouse_system</tt>) copied from user space are laid out in the reserved
region.  Finally, <tt>jailhouse_enable()</tt> calls
<tt>enter_hypervisor()</tt> on each CPU, 
passing it the header, and waits until all these calls return. After that,
Jailhouse is considered enabled and the firmware is released.
<p>
<tt>enter_hypervisor()</tt> is really a thin wrapper that jumps to the
entry point 
set in the header. The entry point is defined in <tt><a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/setup.c">hypervisor/setup.c</a></tt>
as 
<tt>arch_entry</tt>, which 
is coded in assembler and resides in <a
href="https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/hypervisor/arch/x86/entry.S"><tt>x86/entry.S</tt></a>. This
code locates the <tt>per_cpu</tt>
region for a given <tt>cpu_id</tt>, stores the Linux stack
pointer and <tt>cpu_id</tt> in it, sets the Jailhouse stack, and calls the
architecture-independent <tt>entry()</tt>
function, passing it a pointer to <tt>cpu_data</tt>. When this function returns,
the Linux stack pointer is restored.
<p>
The <tt>entry()</tt> function is what actually enables Jailhouse. It
behaves slightly 
differently for the first CPU it initializes than for the rest of them. The
first CPU is called "master"; it is responsible for system-wide
initialization and checks. It sets up paging,
maps <tt>config_memory</tt> if it is present in the system configuration, checks
the memory regions defined in the Linux cell descriptor for alignment and
access flags, initializes the APIC, creates
Jailhouse's Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), configures x2APIC guest (VMX
non-root) access (if available), and initializes the Linux cell. 
After that, VT-d is enabled and configured for the Linux
cell. Non-master CPUs, instead, only initialize themselves.
<p>
 <h4>CPU initialization</h4>
<p>
CPU initialization is a lengthy process that begins in the <tt>cpu_init()</tt>
function. For starters, the CPU is registered as a "Linux CPU": its ID is
validated, and, if it is on the system CPU set, it is added to the Linux
cell. The rest of the procedure is architecture-specific and continues in
<tt>arch_cpu_init()</tt>. For x86, it saves the current register values in
the <tt>cpu_data</tt> structure. These values will be restored on first VM
entry.  Then Jailhouse swaps the IDT (interrupt handlers), the Global
Descriptor Table (GDT) that contains segment descriptors, and CR3 (page
directory pointer) register with its own values.
<p>
Finally, <tt>arch_cpu_init()</tt> fills the <tt>cpu_data-&gt;apic_id</tt>
field (see <tt>apic_cpu_init()</tt>) and
configures Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX) for the CPU. This is done in
<tt>vmx_cpu_init()</tt>, which first 
checks that CPU provides all the required features. Then it prepares
the Virtual Machine Control Structure (VMCS) which is located in
<tt>cpu_data</tt>, and 
enables VMX on the CPU. The VMCS region is
configured in <tt>vmcs_setup()</tt> so that on every VM entry or exit:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The host (Jailhouse) gets the appropriate control and segmentation
  register values. The corresponding VMCS fields are simply copied from 
  the hardware registers set by <tt>arch_cpu_init()</tt>. The LMA and LME
  bits are raised in 
  the host's <tt>IA32_EFER</tt> MSR, indicating that the processor is in
  64-bit mode, 
  and the stack pointer is set to the end of <tt>cpu_data-&gt;stack</tt>
  (remember that   the stack
  grows down). The host's RIP (instruction pointer) is set to
  <tt>vm_exit()</tt> defined in 
  <tt>x86/entry.S</tt>, and interrupts are disabled in the host
  RFLAGS. <tt>vm_exit()</tt>   calls 
  <tt>vmx_handle_exit()</tt> function and resumes VM execution with
  <tt>VMRESUME</tt> 
  instruction when it returns. This way, on each VM exit, interrupts are
  disabled and control is transferred to the dispatch function that
  analyzes the exit reason and acts appropriately. SYSENTER MSRs are cleared
  because Jailhouse has no user-space applications or system calls and its
  guests use a different means to switch to the hypervisor.
<p>
<li> The guest gets its control and segmentation registers from
     <tt>cpu_data-&gt;linux_</tt>*. RSP 
  and RIP are taken from the kernel stack frame created for the
  <tt>arch_entry()</tt> 
  call. This way, on VM entry, Linux code will continue execution as if
  the <tt>entry()</tt> call in <tt>hypervisor_enter()</tt> has already
  completed; thus the kernel is transparently migrated to the cell. The guest's
  <tt>IA32_EFER</tt> MSR is also set to its Linux value so that 64-bit mode
  is enabled on 
  VM entry. Cells besides the Linux cell will reset their CPUs just after
  initialization, overwriting the values defined here.
</ul>
<p>
When all CPUs are initialized, <tt>entry()</tt> calls
<tt>arch_cpu_activate_vmm()</tt>. This is point of no return: it sets the
RAX register to zero, 
loads all the general-purpose registers left and issues a <tt>VMLAUNCH</tt>
instruction 
to enter the guest. Due to the guest register setup described earlier and because
RAX (which, by convention, stores function return values) is zero, Linux will
consider the <tt>entry()</tt> call to be successful and move on as a guest.
<p>
This concludes the Part 1 of the series. In Part 2, we will look at how
Jailhouse handles interrupts, and what needs to be done to create a cell,
and to disable the hypervisor.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

You haven't mentioned another cool thing that distinguishes Jailhouse from Xen.  Not only Jailhouse doesn't care about doing complicated emulation (like Xen does with QEMU in HVM domains); it offloads this to KVM running in the Linux cell.<br>
<p>
In this sense, Jailhouse is in my opinion really "Xen done right". It would also be possible, in principle, to add grant table and event channels hypercalls, so that Jailhouse can run the "PVH"-style (PV with an HVM container) domains that Xen recently got support for.<br>

Yes, that's true. Thanks for pointing this out.<br>
<p>
In this article I focused more on how Jailhouse does things than on what it does. To that end, the official presentation (easily found through initial announcement link) can be a good starting point.<br>

I find it hard to reconciliate "Xen done right" with static partitioning.<br>

How is KVM running in the Linux cell different to the Qemu associated with an HVM guest in an x86 Xen system?<br>

It is the usual KVM hypervisor, running within the Linux kernel.  Jailhouse lets the Linux cell do nested virtualization.<br>
<p>
So, unlike Xen, Jailhouse does not have any knowledge of QEMU.  All the knowledge of emulation is entirely within the Linux cell.<br>

But the "containing" KVM does have emulation, right? In that case what is the overall difference?<br>
<p>
Jailhouse sounds interesting but AFAICT it is no more "Xen done right" than it is "KVM done right", in fact I would venture that in terms of functionality it is pretty much orthogonal to the other two.<br>

It is. The idea is to keep Jailhouse simple but compatible with KVM for those requiring more than Jailhouse provides itself.<br>

The CPU L3 cache, is it being managed in any way?  Or that Linux cell can still happily trash L3 for all the other cells? <br>

I don't remember any specific cache-handling code in Jailhouse neither I remember any benchmarks measuring this trashing's impact on performance. Given the project is quite young, I think this may (or may not) be addressed in future releases.<br>

<p>
This is the second installment of our coverage of the 3.16 merge window.
See last week's <a href="/Articles/601152/">article</a> for a rundown of
what happened in the first few days of the window.  Since then, Linus
Torvalds has returned to the master branch of his repository after merging
back 6800 or so non-merge commits from his next branch.  At this point, he
has merged 8179 patches for 3.16, which is 2831 since last week's article.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the larger changes visible to users:
<ul class="spacylist">

<li>Hugepage migration has been turned off for all architectures except
x86_64 since it is only tested on that architecture and there are bugs for
some of the others.  It can be enabled for other architectures when they are
ready to support it.

<li>Automatic NUMA balancing has been turned off for 32-bit x86.  Existing
32-bit NUMA systems are not well supported by the code and the developers
did not think the effort to support them would be worthwhile. 

<li>The kernel memory control group (kmemcg) has been <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2ee06468702e0742114823a537510cd6f038cacc">marked
in the documentation and Kconfig</a> as "<q>unusable
in real life so DO NOT SELECT IT unless for development
purposes</q>". 

<li>16-bit stack segments will be allowed on 64-bit x86 kernels again.
That feature was disabled due to a kernel information leak of the top 16
bits of the stack pointer that has now been fixed.  Users will regain the
ability to run 16-bit Windows 
programs in Wine on 64-bit kernels.

<li>The kernel EFI code will now handle Unicode characters.  It has also
been changed to save and restore the floating point registers around EFI
calls since EFI firmware may use the FPU.

<li>EFI stub support for ARM64 (aarch64) has been added.

<li>The ARM architecture has gained hibernation support.
It has also made Ftrace work with read-only text in
modules.  In addition, the architecture improved its stack trace support by
excluding the stack-trace 
functions from the trace and by allowing kprobes to record stack traces.

<li>The <tt>remap_file_pages()</tt> system call has been <a
href="/Articles/597632/">marked as deprecated</a>.  The replacement that
emulates the semantics but will run more slowly has not been submitted for
merging yet.

<li>The control group (cgroup) hierarchy handling has been reworked to
provide a single unified hierarchy.  Its use is governed by the
<tt>__DEVEL__sane_behavior</tt> mount option. See our <a
href="/Articles/601840/">article</a> further down
and the new <a
href="/Articles/601923/">Documentation/cgroups/unified-hierarchy.txt</a>
for more information.

<li>Neil Brown's patches to make <a href="/Articles/595652/">loopback NFS
mounts work reliably</a> have been merged through the NFS tree.  The <a
href="/Articles/596618/">other parts of his fixes</a> are coming via other
trees. 

<li>The external data representation (XDR) handling in NFS has been
reworked to support access control lists (ACLs) larger than 4KB.  It also
returns <tt>readdir()</tt> results in chunks larger than 4KB giving better
performance on large directories.

<li>The PowerPC 64-bit little-endian kernel now supports the ELFv2 ABI.  There
is also a new 64-bit little-endian boot wrapper for PowerPC.

<li>New hardware support:</li>

	<ul class="spacylist">

	</ul>

</ul>

<p>
Kernel developers will see the following changes:
</p>

<ul class="spacylist">

<li>Flattened device tree (FDT) parsing has been converted to use libfdt.
Knowledge of FDT internals has also been removed from most architectures
except PowerPC.

<li>Videobuf2 now supports the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard.

<li>The 32-bit only <tt>setup_sched_clock()</tt> has been removed.  Calls
to it have been converted to <tt>sched_clock_register()</tt>. 

<li>The <tt>create_irq()</tt> and <tt>destroy_irq()</tt> interface (and its
variants) for
handling sparse IRQ allocation has been removed.  As Thomas Gleixner <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d09cc3659db494aca4b3bb2393c533fb4946b794">put
it</a>: "<q>get rid of the horrible create_irq interface along with its even more horrible variants</q>".

<li>The ARM level 2 cache support has been cleaned up, which results in a
"<q>much nicer structure</q>" and some performance improvements,
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eb3d3ec567e868c8a3bfbfdfc9465ffd52983d11">according</a>
to Russell King in his pull request.  

<li>ARM64 (aarch64) has added some optimized assembly for string and memory
routines as well as for cryptography algorithms (SHA family, AES, GHASH).
It has also added Ftrace 
support. 

<li>A tracepoint benchmarking facility has been added to the kernel tracing
subsystem. 

<li>Some tracers (latency, wakeup, wakeup_rt, irqsoff, preemptoff,
preemptirqsoff) can now be used in separate tracing instances, though only
one instance can use each tracer at any given time.  Also, the function and
function graph tracers can be used together.

<li>As part of the fix for <a
href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/10/4">CVE-2014-4014</a>,
the <tt>inode_capable()</tt> function has been renamed to
<tt>capable_wrt_inode_uidgid()</tt> to better reflect what it does.

<li>A <tt>decode_stacktrace.sh</tt> script has been added to turn offsets
from symbols into filenames and line numbers to make it easier to read.

</ul>

We should be most of the way through the merge window at this point, but
there may still be merges of interest in the next few days.  Stay tuned for
next week's thrilling conclusion ...<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

</i>
<p>
Didn't even know that was ever possible, but could be useful for my purposes. I wonder where I can find docs on how to allocate actual x86 16-bit segments, or for that matter 32-bit segments from user code? Manpages and googling turned up nothing.

      Thanks, khim. I guess I was too dense to include "ldt" in my queries. The manpage is not too informative, though. It does not say if I can extend the LDT with the call, and a quick test on my home x86_64 machine just returned 0 as the size, when reading the LDT (maybe this works only in 32-bit processes?). I would like to be able to allocate at least about ten LDT entries, in order to partially simulate a legacy system, where code, data and stack are all in different segments, and memory allocation calls return fresh segments with their own LDT entries.
<p>Oh well, I probably have to read relevant bit of the kernel source for further investigations.

      <p>LDT is unusable in 64bit mode, yes. This is hardware limitation. It's fully usable in 32bit process even on x86-64 system with 64bit kernel. For 32bit process there are examples (e.g. you could look on NaCl <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/native_client/trunk/src/native_client/src/trusted/service_runtime/linux/x86/nacl_ldt.c">here</a>).</p>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 4, 2015</br>
           </div>
Last December, a discussion of system stalls related to low-memory
situations led to the revelation that <a href="/Articles/627419/">small
memory allocations never fail</a> in the kernel.  Since then, the
discussion on how to best handle low-memory situations has continued,
focusing in particular on situations where the kernel 
cannot afford to let a memory allocation fail.  That discussion has exposed
some significant differences of opinion on how memory allocation should
work in the kernel.
<p>
<h4>Some introductory concepts</h4>
<p>
The kernel's memory-management subsystem is charged with ensuring that
memory is available when it is needed by either the kernel or a user-space
process.  That job is easy when a lot of memory is free, but it gets harder
once memory fills up â€” as it inevitably does.  When memory gets tight and
somebody is requesting more, the kernel has a couple of options:
(1)&nbsp;free some memory currently in use elsewhere, or (2)&nbsp;deny
(fail) the allocation request.
<p>
The process of freeing (or "reclaiming") memory may involve writing the
current contents of that memory to persistent storage.  That, in turn,
involves calling into the filesystem or block I/O code.  But if any of
those subsystems are, in fact, the source of the allocation request,
calling back into them can lead to deadlocks and other unfortunate
situations.  For that reason (among others), allocation requests carry a
set of flags describing the actions that can be performed in the handling
of the request.  The two flags of interest in this article are
<tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> (calls back into filesystems are not allowed), and
<tt>GFP_NOIO</tt> (no type of I/O can be started).  The former inhibits
attempts to write dirty pages back to files on disk; the latter can block
activity like writing pages to swap.
<p>
Obviously, the more constrained the memory-management subsystem is, the
higher the chances of it being unable to satisfy an allocation request at
all.  Kernel developers have long been told that (almost) any allocation
request can fail; as a result, the kernel is full of error-handling paths
meant to deal with that eventuality.  But it became clear recently that the
memory-management code does not actually allow smaller requests to fail; it
will, instead, loop indefinitely trying to free some memory.  That behavior
has been seen to lead occasionally to locked-up systems, despite the fact
that the code involved is prepared to deal with allocation failures.  The
"too small to fail" behavior is controversial, but would prove hard to
change at this point.
<p>
There are, however, places in the kernel that are simply unprepared to deal
with allocation failures, usually because the allocation happens deep
within a complex series of operations that would be difficult to unwind.
The <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> flag exists to explicitly state that failure is
not an option for a given request, though its use is heavily discouraged.  
<p>
The following discussion, in the end, focuses on two related questions:
(1)&nbsp;should the kernel really be treating small allocations as if they
all had <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> set, and (2)&nbsp;should failure-proof
allocations be supported at all, and, if so, how can that support be made
more robust?
<p>

<h4>No longer too small to fail</h4>
<p>
The discussion (re)started when Tetsuo Handa <a
href="/Articles/635360/">noted</a> that memory allocation behavior had
changed in the 3.19 kernel; in particular, small allocations with the
<tt>GFP_NOIO</tt> or <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> flags would fail under severe memory
pressure.  
In previous kernels, such allocations would loop indefinitely if
no memory was available.  Among other things, this change can cause
filesystem operations to fail on memory-stressed systems where they would
have (eventually) succeeded before.
<p>
The behavior change is the result of <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/9879de7373fcfb46">this patch from
Johannes Weiner</a> which was aimed at avoiding the memory-allocation
deadlocks that started the December discussion.  The intent was to avoid
looping forever in an allocation attempt if it appeared that no progress
was being made toward freeing some memory for that allocation, but, by
accident, it also prevented looping entirely in the <tt>GFP_NOIO</tt> and
<tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> cases.  So those allocations can now fail; that is a
significant change from how previous kernels worked.
<p>
Johannes initially <a href="/Articles/635361/">wanted to keep the new
behavior</a>, saying that it "<q>makes more sense</q>".  But the
filesystem developers disagreed strongly.  It seems that there are numerous
places in the filesystem code that depend on allocations succeeding
reliably, and that many of them are not marked with <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt>. 
Ted Ts'o <a
href="/Articles/635362/">threatened</a> to add a lot of <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt>
flags to allocation calls in the ext4 filesystem if the change were not
reverted.  The memory-management developers were thus faced with the need
to pick the option they disliked least.
<p>
In the end, the filesystem developers won out on this one; Johannes merged
<a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/cc87317726f851531ae8422e0c2d3d6e2d7b1955">a
change</a> into 4.0-rc2 restoring the looping behavior for those allocation
types.  This 
change is likely to end up in the 3.19 stable series as well.  The original
patch is a good argument for the approach of refusing "cleanup" patches
late in the development cycle.  It was merged for the 3.19-rc7 prepatch,
meaning that there was almost no time for problems to be noticed before the
final 3.19 release came out.
<p>
The discussion was not limited to the unexpected effects of one
late-arriving memory-management patch, though.  The bigger problems of how
to avoid deadlocks in low-memory situations and how to ensure that
important tasks can proceed in those situations remain unsolved.
<p>
<h4>The OOM killer</h4>
<p>
The out-of-memory (OOM) killer is implicated in a number of stall scenarios.  In
the original problem reported last December, the OOM killer would choose a
victim that was blocked on a lock, but that lock was held by the process
waiting (forever) for a memory allocation to proceed.  As a result, the
victim could not exit and, thus, could not free its memory. Since the OOM killer
only goes after a single process at a time, everything would stop at that
point. 
<p>
Johannes <a href="/Articles/635364/">suggested a change</a> to how the OOM
killer works: if a targeted process failed to exit after five seconds, the
OOM killer would give up and move on to another victim.  The idea was not
hugely popular, though.  David Rientjes <a href="/Articles/635365/">pointed
out</a> that there was no guarantee that the next victim would be any more
appropriate than the one that came before.  Dave Chinner <a
href="/Articles/635367/">claimed</a> more broadly that efforts to tweak the
OOM killer are misdirected:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I really don't care about the OOM Killer corner cases - it's
	completely the wrong line of development to be spending time on
	and you aren't going to convince me otherwise. The OOM killer a
	crutch used to justify having a memory allocation subsystem that
	can't provide forward progress guarantee mechanisms to callers that
	need it.
</div>
<p>
The end result is that OOM-killer timeouts will probably not find their way
into the memory-management subsystem anytime soon.
<p>
<h4>__GFP_NOFAIL and looping</h4>
<p>
From the point of view of the memory-management developers, many things
would get easier if any allocation request could fail when the necessary
resources are not available.  That would mean getting rid of the implicit "small
allocations never fail" rule, but, beyond that, it would also require
getting rid of the explicit 
<tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> call sites.  Michal Hocko was perhaps the most
outspoken in this regard, <a href="/Articles/635376/">saying</a> that
<tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> "<q>is deprecated and shouldn't be used</q>".
He also suggested that existing <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> call sites should be
reimplemented in a way that allows them to recover from allocation
failures.
<p>
Dave <a href="/Articles/635378/">took issue</a> with that idea, saying that
failure-proof allocations are a hard requirement for the XFS filesystem.
To rework XFS to be able to roll back dirty transactions in the face of an
allocation failure would increase its complexity significantly, he said;
the project 
would take a couple of years to reach a point where it could be put into
production use.  He summarized by saying "<q>I'm not about to spend a
couple of years rewriting XFS just so the VM can get rid of a GFP_NOFAIL
user</q>".  Strangely enough, there were no other developers
volunteering to take on that job either.
<p>
Contemporary filesystems are complex beasts that have to meet a wide
variety of demands.  They incorporate complex transaction mechanisms that
help them to maintain filesystem integrity in every situation possible.
Implementing such a mechanism in a way that allows it to recover from a
memory-allocation failure in the middle of a transaction, after resources
have been committed, locks taken, etc., is not a simple task.  Filesystem
developers on Linux have not taken on that task because, in the end, there
has not been a need to.  Allocations that cannot be allowed to fail have
proved sufficient in almost all situations.
<p>
Once one accepts that some sort of failure-proof allocation mechanism is
needed, though, the next question is: how should it be done?  The
<tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> flag is one solution, but it turns out that quite a
bit of code in the kernel does not make use of it.  Instead, there are a
number of places in the kernel that implement their own retry loops on top
of a <tt>kmalloc()</tt> call without <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt>.  That is
something that the memory-management developers don't like; those
developers would 
rather not see <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> used at all, but they still prefer its
use to retry loops implemented outside of the memory-management subsystem.

Consider, for example, <a href="/Articles/635381/">this message from
Johannes</a> saying that the XFS developers should replace a retry loop
with a single <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> call.
<p>
There are couple of reasons why such loops exist.  One of those is that
<tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> was <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/dab48dab37d2770824420d1e01730a107fade1aa">explicitly
deprecated</a> in 2009; the patch (from Andrew Morton) said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	__GFP_NOFAIL is a bad fiction.  Allocations _can_ fail, and callers
	should detect and suitably handle this (and not by lamely moving
	the infinite loop up to the caller level either).
</div>
<p>
After this change went in, it became harder to get code containing
<tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> past reviewers.  
Whether it is done lamely or not, a hand-coded infinite retry loop is
easier to sneak into the kernel than an easily greppable
<tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt> use.  So that is what developers did.
<p>
The memory-management developers dislike must-succeed allocations because
they complicate the code and, as has occasionally been seen, create the
possibility of deadlocks.  If such allocations must be made, they would
rather see the looping done in the memory-management code, where behavior
can be tweaked and appropriate action taken (starting the OOM killer, for
example) if it becomes clear that no
progress is being made.  In the real world, though, according to both <a
href="/Articles/635383/">Ted</a> and <a href="/Articles/635384/">Dave</a>,
looping actually works pretty well.  The XFS code has a "canary" that puts
out a warning when the looping goes on for too long, but, Dave said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	yet we *rarely* see the canary warnings we emit when we do too many
	allocation retries, the code has been that way for 13-odd years.
	Hence, despite your protestations that your way is *better*, we
	have code that is tried, tested and proven in rugged production
	environments. That's far more convincing evidence that the *code
	should not change* than your assertions that it is broken and needs
	to be fixed.
</div>
<p>
One might take that as a statement that the XFS developers are currently
uninterested in replacing their own loops with <tt>__GFP_NOFAIL</tt>
invocations.  But they actually have another reason to maintain a loop
outside of the memory-management code: <a href="/Articles/635385/">they
want to retain control</a> over how the filesystem should respond to
low-memory conditions.  It is, in their mind, a policy decision that the
memory-management code lacks the information to handle.  There are
currently plans afoot to expose some of that policy to user space, allowing
administrators to configure what the filesystem's low-memory response
should be.
<p>
<h4>Reservations</h4>
<p>
Still, there is no real disagreement over this idea: looping over a failing
memory allocation is undesirable and best avoided whenever possible.  Thus
it may well be that the most useful part of the discussion came when the
developers got around to the topic of avoiding allocation failures
altogether.  There are a few ways of working toward that goal.
<p>
One of those is preallocation â€” allocating all of the needed memory
resources before the code gets to a point where it can't back out of a
transaction.  Preallocation is used in many contexts in the kernel and
works well, so it was natural for the memory-management developers to ask
whether it can be used in this context.  Dave <a
href="/Articles/635387/">shot that idea down</a> fairly quickly:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	 However, preallocation is dumb, complex, CPU and memory intensive
	 and will have a *massive* impact on performance.  Allocating
	 10-100 pages to a reserve which we will almost *never use* and
	 then free them again *on every single transaction* is a lot of
	 unnecessary additional fast path overhead.  Hence a "preallocate
	 for every context" reserve pool is not a viable solution.
</div>
<p>
<a href="/Articles/22909/#mempool">Mempools</a> were also raised as a
possibility.  They are a form of preallocation that might avoid some of the
overhead described above.  But they are, <a
href="/Articles/635389/">according to Dave</a>, poorly suited to the
problem at hand.  Mempools deal with a single size of object, while a
filesystem transaction needs a wide variety of objects; that implies that
several mempools would be needed at various levels in the stack.  There is
also a 
mismatch between object lifetimes that make mempools difficult to use
across multiple transactions.  So mempools do not appear to be an option
either.
<p>
Dave's suggestion, instead, is to add the concept of "reservations" to the
memory-management subsystem.  Prior to entering a transaction, the
filesystem code would inform the memory-management code that it will need
guaranteed access to a certain amount of memory; calculating an approximate
memory requirement is, apparently, not that hard.  The memory-management code
would then ensure that the requisite amount of memory would be available;
subsequent allocation requests would dip into the reserve if need be.  As
long as the estimate for the size of the reserve is sufficient, there
should be no problem with failing allocations during the transaction.
<p>
Reservations may look a lot like preallocation, but there is a crucial
difference.  The memory-management code already maintains a "watermark," a
level of free memory below which it is unwilling to go unless absolutely
necessary.  A reservation would simply raise that watermark, making a bit
less memory available to the system as a whole.  If a reservation would
raise the watermark above the amount of memory that is currently free, the
request would block until more memory could be reclaimed.  In the simplest
case, a reservation would be represented as an increased value in a single
integer variable.
<p>
There seems to be some general support for the addition of a reservation
mechanism, but things get less clear once one looks at the details.  Andrew
Morton <a href="/Articles/635390/">suggested a scheme</a> where a process
making a reservation would get a number of "tokens"; subsequent allocations
done by that process would come from the reserve first.  Dave <a
href="/Articles/635391/">does not like that idea</a>, saying that it fails
to account for the fact that many objects allocated during a transaction
will be freed (perhaps by others) shortly and, thus, should not come from
the reservation.  His view of the reservation, instead, is a range of
memory that is not touched at all unless there is no alternative; even
then, only allocations using the <tt>GFP_RESERVE</tt> flag would be able to
get at that memory.  The reservation, in his view, comes into play when the
kernel would have otherwise put the OOM killer into action.
<p>
Johannes, instead, <a href="/Articles/635392/">says</a> that this approach
will not work.  The problem is that "<q>we simply don't KNOW the exact
point when we ran out of reclaimable memory<q>", so the
memory-management subsystem cannot easily guarantee the sort of loose
reservation that Dave has described.  Dave disagreed with that assessment,
it almost goes without saying.  And that is about where the conversation
wound down.
<p>
Reservations are a promising idea for a solution to some of the kernel's
memory-allocation challenges.  But, at this point, it is just an idea; it has
neither code nor a design consensus behind it.  The discussion has slowed
for the moment, but that is almost certain to be a temporary state of
affairs.  The annual <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-storage-filesystem-and-mm-summit">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit</a> is less than one week
away as of this writing.  This subject is on <a

      That is the preallocation scenario described in the article.  In relatively simple situations it can be done, and that pattern appears in a lot of places in the kernel.  In more complex situations, though, there is really no way to know how much to preallocate or in what form.

You could sort-of say that the kernel already sets aside a few megabytes of preallocation, to be used during interrupts (GFP_ATOMIC).<br>

Because the alternatives to optimistically hoping that there's enough storage and CoWing as needed, failing only if you actually run out, are also awful.<br>
<p>
You can reserve the entire process's dirty memory space on every fork(), as Solaris does, but that makes fork()/exec() require massive amounts of memory that is hardly ever used. As an Emacs user, I used to get really annoyed when I couldn't do a simple C-u M-! blah RET because there were 'only' a few gigabytes of free swap!<br>
<p>
Alternatively you can ditch fork()/exec() and go to a spawn-like model, like Windows does, eliminating the need to allocate that extra memory by constraining what you can do between the conceptual fork() and exec(). But that leads to a horrifyingly complex interface which is always too limited, since it's trying to reimplement "everything you might ever want to do in the child before executing" using something simple enough that allocation is constrained.<br>
<p>
There is no easy solution here. If there was, people would have found it by now.<br>
<p>
(Eliminating fork()/exec() also won't fix the problem -- among other things, stack allocations are still optimistic, even on Windows, IIRC.)<br>

I have written an operating system and kernel, and the model I use is to spawn a process (load it up into memory and give it space in the process table and so on) without actually starting it until the person calling it is ready. Then you have any number of interfaces for tweaking the environment it runs in before you finally give the go-ahead to start executing it.<br>

It does: fork() gives back the PID, and you can use it to both monitor and kill the child.<br>
<p>
The API used to monitor the child (ptrace(), natch) is so terrible that nobody uses it for ordinary post-fork() actions, but still, you already have exactly that.<br>

The PID that fork gives you only gets you so far. The child process may have died and the PID been recycled before you try to use the PID in the parent process. You can mostly handle this by handling SIGCHLD properly, but that can be fiddly, and doesn't really work when you get to grandchildren and so on.<br>

Nah, it's safe: if you're going to use ptrace() you have to waitpid() anyway, and waitpid() is exactly what you need if you're going to detect the process dying, let alone reap it, which is a precondition for PID recycling to happen.<br>

One option hereâ€”though extremely disruptiveâ€”would be to take all the system calls that modify a process's state and make them take an additional handle/FD identifying the target process. Then you could just spawn a blank, suspended process, obtaining a handle, and use normal system calls to get the process into the right state before making it runnable. With this approach you wouldn't need to implement anything twice; the downside is that it implies a new security domain, permission to perform system calls on behalf of another process. That permission could automatically terminate once the process is made runnable, ending the initialization phase.<br>

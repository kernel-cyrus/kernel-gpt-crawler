Kristen Accardi started her LinuxCon Japan session with the claim that idle
is the most important workload on most client systems.  Computers placed in
offices are busy less than 25% of the time; consumer systems have even less
to do.  So idle performance, especially with regard to power consumption,
is important.  The good news is that hardware engineers have been putting a
lot of work into reducing the power consumption of idle systems; the bad
news is that operating systems are often failing to take full advantage of that
work.
<p>
In the "good old days," Kristen said, power management was relatively easy —
and relatively ineffective.  The "Advanced Power Management" (APM) mechanism
was entirely controlled by the BIOS, so operating systems didn't have to
pay much attention to it.  Intel's "SpeedStep" offered exactly one step of
CPU frequency scaling.  The operating system could concern itself with
panel dimming on laptop systems.  That was about the extent of the
power-management capabilities provided by the hardware at that time.
<p>
With the rise of the mobile market, though, power management started to get more
complicated.  ACPI was introduced, putting more power-management work into
the operating system's domain.  With ACPI came the notion of "S-states"
(for system-wide power-management states), "C-states" (for CPU idle
states), and "P-states" (for performance-level states — frequency and
voltage scaling).  There can be up to 25 of these states.
<p>
But things do not stop there; in recent years there has been an explosion
of power-management features.  They have names like SOix (a new low-power
state) and PSR ("panel self refresh").  All of these features must be
understood by the operating system, and all must work together for them to
be effective.
<p>
<h4>Degrees of idleness</h4>
<p>
There are, Kristen said, three fundamental degrees of idleness in a system,
differing in the amount of power they use and the time it takes to get back
to an active state.  The level with the lowest power consumption is "off."
That is an increasingly uninteresting state, though; many consumer devices
no longer have an "off" switch at all.  Operating system support for the
"off" state tends to be easy, so there wasn't much to talk about there.
<p>
The other two states are "suspend" and "runtime idle".  A suspended system
is in an intermediate state between running and off; runtime idle is closer

<a href="/Articles/647626/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2015/lcj/KristenAccardi-sm.jpg" width=150 height=188
alt="[Kristen Accardi]" title="Kristen Accardi" hspace=3 vspace=3 border=0
align="right"></a> 

to a running system with nearly instant response when needed.  The support
for the two states in the kernel is entirely different in a number of
ways.  Suspend is a system-wide state initiated by the user, while runtime
idle is a device-specific state that happens
opportunistically.  In a suspended system, all tasks are frozen and all
devices are forced into the idle state; with runtime idle, instead, tasks
are still scheduled and devices may be active.  Suspend can happen at any
time, while runtime idle only comes into play when a device is idle.
<p>
Device drivers must support these two states separately; it is more work,
but it's important to do.  But platform-level support is also important.
In current times, everything is a system-on-chip (SoC) with a great many
interactions between components.  If one of those components is active, it
can keep the entire system out of the lower-power states.
<p>
To see how that can come to pass, consider the "latency tolerance
reporting" (LTR) mechanism built into modern buses.  Any device on the bus
can indicate that it may need the CPU's attention within a given maximum
time (the latency
tolerance).  The CPU, in turn, maintains a table describing the amount of
time required to return to active operation from each of its idle states.
When the CPU is ready to go into a low-power state, the latency
requirements declared by active devices will be compared against that table
to determine the lowest state that the CPU can go into.  So, if a device is
running and declaring a tight latency tolerance, it can prevent the CPU
from entering a deep-idle state.
<p>
<h4>Where the trouble lies</h4>
<p>
Kristen then gave a tour of the parts of the system that are, in her
experience, particularly likely to trip things up.  At the top of the list
was graphics processors (GPUs); these are complex devices and it tends to
take quite a while to get power management working properly on them.  The
"RC6" mechanism 
describes a set of power states for GPUs; naturally, one wants the GPU to
be in a low-power state when it doesn't have much to do.  Beyond that,
framebuffer compression can reduce memory bandwidth use depending on what's in
the framebuffer; sending less video data results in lower power usage.
Kristen suggested that users choose a simple (highly compressible)
background image on their devices for 
the best power behavior.  "Panel self refresh" allows the CPU to stop
sending video data to the screen entirely if things are not changing; it
can be inhibited by things like animated images on the screen.
<p>
Another "problem child" is audio.  On many systems, audio data can be
routed through the GPU, preventing it from going into an idle state.  Audio
devices tend to be complex, consisting of, at a minimum, a controller and a
codec; drivers must manage power-management states for both of those
devices together.
<p>
On the USB side, the USB 3.0 specification added a number of useful
power-management features.  USB 2.0 had a "selective suspend" feature, but
it adds a lot of latency, reducing its usefulness.  In 3.0, the controller
can suspend itself, but only if all connected devices are suspended.  The
USB "link power management" mechanism can detect low levels of activity and
reduce power usage.
<p>
There are three power-management technologies available for SATA devices.
The link power management mechanism can put devices into a sleep state and,
if warranted, turn the bus off entirely.  "ZPODD" is power management for
optical devices, but Kristen has never seen anybody actually use it;
optical devices are, in general, not as prevalent as they once were.  The
SATA controller itself offers some power-management features, but they tend
to be problematic, she said, so they are not much used in Linux.
<p>
The PCI Express bus has a number of power-management options, including
ASPM for link-level management, RTPM as a runtime power-management feature,
and latency tolerance reporting.  The I2C bus has fewer features, being a
simpler bus, but it is usually possible to power-down I2C controllers.
Human-input devices, which are often connected via I2C, tend to stay
powered up while they are open, which can be a problem for system-wide
power management.
<p>
And, of course, software activity can keep a system from going into deep
idle states.  If processes insist on running, the CPU will stay active,
leaving suspend as the only viable option for power savings.  Even brief
periods running in the CPU can, if they cause it to wake from idle often,
significantly reduce battery life.
<p>
<h4>Idle together</h4>
<p>
The conclusion from all of this is that power management requires a
coordinated effort.  For a system to go into a low-power state, a number of
things must happen.  User space must be quiet, the platform must support
low-power states across all devices, and the kernel must properly support
each device's power-management features.  The system must also be
configured properly; Kristen expressed frustration at mainstream
distributions that fail to set up proper power management at installation
time, wasting the effort that has been put into
power-management support at the lower levels.  Getting all of the pieces to work
together properly can be a 
difficult task, but the result — systems that efficiently run our most
important workload — is worth the trouble.

Distros constantly express their frustration at Intel not trying to make things just work out of the box by default.<br>
<p>
Like audio PM has never been enabled by default as it was too much effort, most of the GPU powersaving features work on platforms Intel care about like Chromebooks, Android, but the features usually languish behind a kernel option that is defaulted to off because nobody spends the time to fix the bugs in the real world.<br>

Is not how company choose to spend their resources to fix bugs in the real world dictated by the market?<br>
<p>
I would be surprised if Intel did not priorities their development resources depending on if the affected components was used on server, mobile/tablet or desktop, laptop, netbook or all three of them.<br>
<p>
With desktop, laptop, netbook on linux having less than 2% market share in total [1] ) it would make bugs that affect this market share the last thing on the corporate developers priority list to fix. <br>
<p>
It's probably so low down the priority list that it is next to "Only accept patches, It's open source if those so desperately need this to be fixed, the affected users can step up and provide patches to fix it themselves."<br>

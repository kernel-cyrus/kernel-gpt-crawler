The ever-contentious Linux Security Modules (LSM) API is being debated once
again on linux-kernel, not its removal, which Linus Torvalds came down
firmly against, but whether it should allow security modules to be loaded
dynamically.  As part of 2.6.24, Torvalds merged a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/239962/">patch to convert LSM into a static
interface</a>, but has indicated a willingness to revert it.  The key
sticking point is whether there are real security modules that require the
ability to be runtime-loaded.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/255640/">complaint by Thomas
Fricaccia</a> about the change caused Torvalds to put out a call for folks
using module loading with their LSM code.  The patch could be reverted if
there are "real-world" uses for that ability.  Torvalds again <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/255641/">questions the sanity of security
developers</a>, but is clearly looking for someone to step up:
<div class="BigQuote">
I'd like to note that I asked people who were actually affected, and had 
examples of their real-world use to step forward and explain their use, 
and that I explicitly mentioned that this is something we can easily 
re-visit.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Jan Engelhardt responded with information about his <a
href="http://jengelh.hopto.org/p/multiadm/">MultiAdmin</a> module, which
allows multiple root users on a system, each with their own UID.  This
allows separate tracking of file ownership, resource usage and the like for
each administrator.  MultiAdmin also
allows for the creation of sub-administrators who can perform some root activities for
processes and files owned by a subset of users.  The use case he cites is
for professors being allowed to administer their students' accounts without
getting full root privileges.
</p>

<p> James Morris, who proposed the static LSM change, responded that
MultiAdmin seemed to qualify as a real-world use under Torvalds's criteria.
Though it is not clear that MultiAdmin <i>requires</i> a loadable
interface, it does use it.  The venerable <a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6279">root_plug security
module</a> &ndash; which only allows root processes to start if a
particular USB device is plugged in &ndash; also implements loading and
unloading.  In both cases, configuration <i>could</i> be done via
<tt>sysfs</tt> parameters with an enable flag to turn them on or off.</p>

<p> To some extent, for the examples offered so far, loading is a
convenience for administrators, but the major users for unloading are
developers.  Crispin Cowan sums it up: 

<div class="BigQuote"> Why would you
want to dynamically unload a module: because it is convenient for
debugging. Ok, so it is unsafe, and sometimes wedges your kernel, which
sometimes forces you to reboot. With this patch in place, it forces you to
*always* reboot when you want to try a hack to the module.  </div> 

</p>

<p>
Other justifications for leaving the LSM loadable interface in the kernel
have been less compelling.  It is hard to imagine that the US
Sarbanes-Oxley regulation would
allow loading security modules into a running kernel, but not allow the
kernel to be rebuilt as Fricaccia <a
href="/Articles/255665/">suggested</a>.  Inserting proprietary security modules that
are provided from the vendor in a binary-only form seems foolhardy &ndash;
this kind of potential abuse is the kind of hole Morris's patch was meant
to close &ndash; but could be
seen as a reason to allow LSM loading.
</p>

<p>
A compromise may have been found in a <a href="/Articles/255666/">patch
posted by Arjan van de Ven</a>, which converts LSM to be either static or
loadable depending on a compile-time kernel option.  A consensus seems to
be building that this is a reasonable approach, allowing distributions and
users to decide for themselves whether they will allow security modules to
be loaded.  As of this writing, Torvalds has not weighed back in with a
decision and the newly released 2.6.24-rc1 kernel has the static patch.
</p>

<p>
Dynamic loading of security modules is a potential source of problems
&ndash; what better place for a rootkit to hide? &ndash; but there are
valid reasons that someone might want to use it.  Linux strives to be open
to many uses, including some that the kernel hackers might find
distasteful; dynamic security modules would seem to be one of those uses.

Personally, I think it's absolutely essential to be able to build a kernel with dynamic LSM.
Whether we like it or not, people do want to add in runtime loadable security modules for
things like virus scanners, and until upstream offers these folks a viable alternative to
LSM...well, they'll use it.

Jon.

So do I.
One example is: dazuko for on-access virus scanning.
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://lwn.net/Articles/206075/">http://lwn.net/Articles/206075/</a>

If Linux wants to care about security, he should move on and incorporate PaX, Grsecurity or
RSBAC.

Using Grsec you can load whatever modules you want at start time, and keep the system in that
states blocking further module changes. This is a better working approach, which takes care
more than just the LSM subsystem.

Regards,
Dw.

A stylistic note: the use of last-names-only sounds really *strange* in this context, probably
because everybody actually doing development uses first names wherever practically possible :)

A rootkit can trivially hide wherever it likes if module loading is enabled: rootkits don't
respect the exportedness of symbols.

(Most common rootkits can inject themselves by banging directly on /dev/mem. It will be good
to finally eliminate the ability to write to that device... come on pci-rework, we want X to
not depend on /dev/mem anymore :) )

      That has already been suggested at least twice.

It takes about the same amount of time to boot a kernel under lguest as it does to load a module.  You can script it, as lguest output can be redirected, and don't corrupt the system when your code has a bug.

It would be great if people actually followed the discussion.

      Loadable security modules are a potential problem, because there's a time prior to them being loaded when the system is potentially insecure. Well, maybe. That would seem to depend on the default access rights. It would seem perfectly possible for certain components to have automatic denial of access unless specifically permitted (a generalization of the ideas in mandatory access controls). In which case, loadable security modules would be less of a security hole.
<p>
The only context I can think of is where you have specific needs (such as maintenance of embedded systems) that need special rights but are so infrequent that having the code for those rights permanently present is inefficient use of memory and CPU cycles. This only matters, though, when one or both of these are so heavily constrained that even the tiny difference made by an LSM module would have a significant operational impact.
<p>
The question then becomes one of whether the mainstream kernel should actively support such special cases. Are they common enough to be mainlined, or rarities that shouldn't be actively prohibited by kernel design but only really supported by an external patch?

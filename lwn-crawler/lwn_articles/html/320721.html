<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 3, 2009</br>
           </div>
As the 2.6.29 kernel development cycle draws toward its eventual close, it
is appropriate to look back at the internal API changes which have been
made.  The following list cannot possibly be exhaustive, but, hopefully, it
captures the major points.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The massive <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/251469/">task credentials
     patch set</a> has been merged.  This code reorganizes the handling of
     process credentials (user ID, capabilities, etc.).  One of the
     immediate implications of this change is direct references to
     credential-oriented fields in the task structure need to be changed;
     for example, <tt>current-&gt;user-&gt;uid</tt> becomes
     <tt>current_uid()</tt>.  See <a
     href="/Articles/313616/">Documentation/credentials.txt</a> for a
     description of the new API.
<p>
<li> The ftrace code has seen a lot of internal changes.  The function
     tracing feature has seen a number of improvements, and the developers
     have added 
     mechanisms  to profile the behavior of <tt>if</tt> statements,
     provide function call graphs,
     obtain user-space stack traces, and
     follow CPU power-state transitions.
<p>
<li> Most of the callback functions/methods associated with the
     <tt>net_device</tt> structure have been moved out of that structure
     and into the new <tt>struct&nbsp;net_device_ops</tt>.  In-tree drivers
     have been converted to the new API.
<p>
<li> The <tt>priv</tt> field has been removed from <tt>struct
     net_device</tt>; drivers should use <tt>netdev_priv()</tt> instead. 
<p>
<li> The generic PHY layer now has power management support.  To that end,
     two new methods - <tt>suspend()</tt> and <tt>resume()</tt> - have been
     added to <tt>struct&nbsp;phy_driver</tt>.
<p>
<li> The networking layer now supports <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/243949/">large receive offload</a> (or
     "generic receive offload") operation.
<p>
<li> The NAPI API has been cleaned up somewhat; in particular, functions
     like <tt>netif_rx_schedule()</tt>, <tt>netif_rx_schedule_prep()</tt>,
     and <tt>netif_rx_complete()</tt> have lost the unneeded <tt>struct
     net_device</tt> parameter.
<p>
<li> The <tt>poll()</tt> file operation is now allowed to sleep; see <a
     href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308426/">this article</a> for more
     information on this change.
<p>
<li> The CPU mask mechanism, used to represent sets of processors in the
     system, is in the middle of being massively reworked.  The problem is
     that CPU masks were often put on the stack, but, as the number of
     processors grows, the stack lacks room for the mask.  The new API is designed to
     get these masks off the stack, and to guard against anybody ever
     trying to put one back.  See <a
     href="http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/index.cgi/2009/01/07#2009-01-07">this
     posting by Rusty Russell</a> for details on this work.
<p>
<li> An <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/314808/">infrastructure for
     asynchronous function calls</a> has been merged.  This code is still a
     work in progress, though, and, for 2.6.29, it will not be activated in
     the absence of the <tt>fastboot</tt> command-line parameter.
<p>

<li> The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/308426/">exclusive I/O memory
     allocation functions</a> have been merged.

<p>


<li> There is a new synchronous hash interface called "shash."  It 
     simplifies the use of synchronous hash operations while allowing the
     same tfm to be used simultaneously in different threads.  All in-tree
     users have been switched to the new API.
<p>
<li> The hrtimer code has been simplified with the removal of variable
     modes for callback functions.  All processing is now done in hardirq
     context. 
<p>
<li> A new set of LSM hooks has been added; these support pathname-based
     security operations.  With the merging of these hooks, one major
     obstacle to the inclusion of security modules like AppArmor and TOMOYO
     has been removed.
<p>
<li> The kernel will now refuse to build with GCC 4.1.0 or 4.1.1; those
     versions have unfortunate bugs which prevent the building of a working
     kernel.  Versions 3.0 and 3.1 have also been deemed to be too old and
     will not be supported in 2.6.29.
<p>
<li> Video4Linux drivers now use a separate <tt>v4l2_file_operations</tt>
     structure to hold their VFS-like callbacks.  The prototypes of a
     number of these functions have been changed to remove the
     <tt>inode</tt> argument.
<p>
<li> Video4Linux2 has also acquired a new "subdevice" concept, meant to
     reflect the fact that video "devices" tend to be, in reality, a set of
     cooperating devices.  See <a href="/Articles/313784/">the new
     document</a> for a description of how this mechanism works.

<p>
<li> Two new functions - <tt>stop_machine_create()</tt> and
     <tt>stop_machine_destroy()</tt> - allow the independent creation of
     the threads used by <tt>stop_machine()</tt>.  That, in turn, lets
     those threads be created before trying to actually stop the machine,
     making that operation more resistant to failure.
<p>
<li> The exports for a number of SUNRPC functions have been changed to
     GPL-only. 
<p>
<li> The internal MTD (memory technology device) API has seen significant
     changes aimed at supporting larger devices (those requiring 64-bit
     sizes). 
</ul>

      <p>A couple of corrections:</p>

<blockquote>The networking layer now supports large receive offload (or "generic receive offload") operation.</blockquote>

<p>LRO for TCP/IPv4 was already there, but GRO is a more general and cleaner implementation. In particular, it will support IPv6 and will play nicely with IP forwarding and bridging.</p>

<blockquote>The NAPI API has been cleaned up somewhat; in particular, functions like netif_rx_schedule(), netif_rx_schedule_prep(), and netif_rx_complete() have lost the unneeded struct net_device parameter.</blockquote>

<p>These functions then became completely equivalent with the corresponding napi_* functions, so they will be gone completely in 2.6.30.</p>

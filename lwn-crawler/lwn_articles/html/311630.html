<p>
Adding a system call to the kernel is never done lightly.  It is important
to get it right before it gets merged because, once that happens, it
must be maintained as part of the kernel's binary interface forever.  The
proposal to <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/311092/">add <tt>preadv()</tt>
and <tt>pwritev()</tt> system calls</a> provides an excellent example of
the kinds of concerns that need to be addressed when adding to the kernel
ABI.
</p>

<p>
The two system calls themselves are quite straightforward.  Essentially,
they combine the existing <tt>pread()</tt> and <tt>readv()</tt> calls
(along with 
the write variants of course) into
a way to do scatter/gather I/O at a particular offset in the file.  Like
<tt>pread()</tt>, the current file position is
unaffected.  The calls, which are available on various BSD systems, can be
used to avoid races between an <tt>lseek()</tt> call and a read or
write.  Currently, applications must do some kind of locking to prevent
multiple threads from stepping on each other when doing this kind of I/O.
</p>

<p>
The prototypes for the functions look much like readv/writev, simply adding
the offset as the final parameter: 
<pre>
    ssize_t preadv(int d, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt, off_t offset);
    ssize_t pwritev(int d, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt, off_t offset);
</pre>
But, because <tt>off_t</tt> is a 64-bit quantity, this causes problems on
some architectures due to the way system call arguments are
passed.  After Gerd Hoffmann posted <a href="/Articles/311729/">version 2
of the patchset</a>, Matthew Wilcox was quick to <a
href="/Articles/311730/">point out</a> a problem:
<div class="BigQuote">
Are these prototypes required?  MIPS and PARISC will need wrappers to
fix them if they are.  These two architectures have an ABI which
requires 64-bit arguments to be passed in aligned pairs of registers,
but glibc doesn't know that (and given the existence of syscall(3),
can't do much about it even if it knew), so some of the arguments end up
in the wrong registers.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Several other architectures (ARM, PowerPC, s390, ...) have similar
constraints.  Because the offset is the fourth argument, it gets placed in
the r3 and r4 32-bit registers, but some architectures need it in either
r2/r3 or r4/r5.  This led some to advocate reordering the
parameters, putting the offset before <tt>iovcnt</tt> to avoid the
problem.  As long as that change doesn't bubble out to user space, Hoffmann
is <a href="/Articles/311731/">amenable to making the change</a>:
"<q>I'd *really* hate it to have the same system call with different 
argument ordering on different systems though</q>".
</p>

<p>
Most seemed to agree that the user-space interface as presented by glibc
should match what the BSDs provide.  It causes too many headaches for folks
trying to write standards or portable code otherwise.  To fix the
alignment problem, the system call itself has the reordered version of the
arguments.  That led 
to Hoffmann's <a href="/Articles/311734/">third version of the
patchset</a>, which still didn't solve the whole problem.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple architectures that have both 32 and 64-bit versions and
the 64-bit kernel must support system calls from 32-bit user-space
programs.  Those programs will put 64-bit arguments into two registers,
but the 64-bit kernel will expect that argument in a single register.
Because of this, Arnd Bergmann <a href="/Articles/311736/">recommended
splitting the offset into two arguments</a>, one for the high 32 bits and
one for the low: "<q>This is the only way I can see that lets us use a
shared compat_sys_preadv/pwritev across all 64 bit architectures</q>".
</p>

<p>
When a 32-bit user-space program makes a system call on a 64-bit system,
the <tt>compat_sys_*</tt> version is used to handle differences in the data
sizes.  If a pointer to a structure is passed to a system call, and that
structure has a different representation in 32-bits than it does in
64-bits, the <tt>compat</tt> layer makes the translation.  Because
different 64-bit architectures do things differently in terms of calling
conventions and alignment requirements, the only way to share
<tt>compat</tt> code is to remove the 64-bit quantity from the system call
interface entirely.
</p>

<p>
That just leaves one final problem to overcome: endian-ness.  As Ralf
Baechle <a href="/Articles/311737/">notes</a>, MIPS can be either little or
big-endian, so the <tt>compat_sys_preadv/pwritev()</tt> needs
to put the two 32-bit offset values together in the proper way.  He
recommended moving the MIPS-specific <tt>merge_64()</tt> macro into a common
<tt>compat.h</tt> include file, which could then be used by the common
<tt>compat</tt> routines.  So far, version 4 of the patchset has not
emerged, but one suspects that the offset argument splitting and use of
<tt>merge_64()</tt> will be part of it.
</p>

<p>
The implementation of the operation of <tt>preadv()</tt> and
<tt>pwritev()</tt> is very obvious, certainly in comparison to the
intricacies of passing its arguments.  The VFS implementations of
<tt>readv()</tt>/<tt>writev()</tt> already take an offset argument, so it
was simply a matter of calling those.  It is interesting to note that as
part of the review, Christoph Hellwig <a href="/Articles/311738/">spotted a
bug</a> in the existing <tt>compat_sys_readv/writev()</tt> implementations
which would lead to accounting information not being updated for those
calls. 
</p>

<p>
This is not the first time these system calls have been proposed; way back
in 2005, we <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/164887/">looked at some
patches from Badari Pulavarty</a> that added them.  Other than a brief
appearance in the -mm tree, they seem to have faded away.
Even if this edition of <tt>preadv()</tt> and <tt>pwritev()</tt> do not make
it into the 
mainline&mdash;so far there are no indications that they
won't&mdash;the code review surrounding it was certainly useful.  Getting a
glimpse of the complexities around 64-bit quantities being passed to system
calls was quite informative as well.

This doesn't seem like a kernel issue.  If gcc can't call a function whose fourth argument is an int64_t, then either gcc or that platform's ABI is broken.<br>

      Why not extend struct iovec with an offset field:
<pre>
struct iovecs
{
  void  *iovs_base;
  size_t iovs_len;
  off_t  iovs_off;
};
</pre>

<pre>
ssize_t preadv(int d, const struct iovecs *iovs, int iovcnt);
ssize_t pwritev(int d, const struct iovecs *iovs, int iovcnt);
</pre>

Bad things could happen if offsets are going backward:performance penality or data overlapping. And this kind of interface are not the best regarding to error report.
So the kernel would have to enforce (iovs[n].iovs_off + iovs[n].iovs_len) < iovs[n+1].iovs_off

While you are at it, put a direction flag in each vector so that you can submit reads and writes at the same time.  And put the file descriptor in each vector too so that you can submit I/O to different files with one syscall.  Then make it asynchronous and add in an optional signal upon completion.  Oh wait, io_submit() already does all that.<br>

Except that Linux AIO (io_submit) isn't always asynchronous, and you can't easily tell when it will block the caller.<br>
<p>
Some folks asking for preadv/pwritev are actually doing so because they rejected Linux AIO for being too broken to use.<br>
<p>
They are preferring to use preadv/pwritev in userspace helper threads, than Linux AIO, because at least with threads it is always asynchronous.<br>

That must be the security bit for packets of which I have heard mention now and then ... sort of like Perl's taint flag, maybe.<br>

This is quite an interesting problem, and one we've also encountered
with virtualization.  Paravirtualized guests are a bit like processes, and like
processes they can make hypercalls (which are a bit like system calls).
</p>

<p>
Where the complexity arises is system administrators want to run
a mixture of 32 bit and 64 bit guests on a system (and on crazy
architectures like IA64, they can even run a mixture of big and little
endian guests).  So there's a degree of complexity ensuring the
guests are all passing identical C structs to hypercalls, particularly
in the "32-on-64" case.

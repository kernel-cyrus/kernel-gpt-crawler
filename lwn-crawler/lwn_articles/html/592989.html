<h1>3.15 Merge window, part 1</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 9, 2014</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, 11,321 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the
mainline repository during the 3.15 merge window.  That makes 3.15 one of
the busiest development cycles ever, though it has not yet surpassed 3.10,
which saw 11,963 changes pulled during the merge window.  Despite all these
changes, the list of new features is not as big or as impressive as one
might expect; much of the work being merged is under-the-covers cleanup and
restructuring. 
<p>
That said, there is still a lot of interesting stuff brewing for 3.15.
User-visible changes in this release will include:
<p>
<ul>
<p>

<li> The <a href="/Articles/585439/">latency tolerance patches</a> have
     been added to the power-management quality-of-service subsystem.  This
     code allows the kernel (or user space) to communicate latency
     requirements to peripheral devices, which should use that information
     to avoid going into overly deep sleep states.

</blockquote>
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/495543/">active/inactive list balancing patch
     set</a> has found its way into the memory management subsystem at
     last.  This work tries to detect situations where the kernel is
     pushing pages out of memory, only to fault them back in shortly
     thereafter; when that happens, the sizes of the LRU lists are adjusted
     in an attempt to improve the situation.  The result should be improved
     performance for workloads with large working sets.
<p>
<li> The new <a href="/Articles/569134/"><tt>renameat2()</tt> system
     call</a> adds the ability to atomically exchange two files.  There is
     also a <tt>RENAME_NOREPLACE</tt> flag that prevents a rename operation
     from replacing an existing file.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/586904/">file-private POSIX locks</a> feature
     has been merged.
<p>
<li> The FUSE (filesystems in user space) subsystem can now perform
     writeback caching, improving performance on write-heavy workloads.
<p>
<li> The UBI flash translation layer has gained a driver that can make a
     flash device appear to be a (read-only, for now) block device.  That
     enables the use of any filesystem on top of a raw flash device.
<p>
<li> The ext4 and XFS filesystems now support the new
     <tt>FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE</tt> 
     and <a href="/Articles/589260/"><tt>FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE</tt></a>
     operations.  XFS also has added support for the <tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> flag.
<p>
<li> The device mapper has a new "dm-era" target that can maintain a list
     of blocks changed during a user-defined period of time.  See <a
     href="/Articles/593668/">Documentation/device-mapper/era.txt</a> for
     more information.
<p>
<li> The device tree information found in <tt>/proc/device-tree</tt> has
     been removed.  That same information is available in sysfs under
     <tt>/sys/firmware/devicetree/base</tt>, so <tt>/proc/device-tree</tt> is
     now a symbolic link to that location.
<p>
<li> The ipset packet filtering interface has a new "hash:ip,mark" set type
     for matching packets with specific marks added by higher-level
     filtering tools.
<p>
<li> The just-in-time compiler for BPF-based packet filtering code has been
     extensively reworked, with a different instruction set.  See  
     <a href="/Articles/593476/#internals">the
     "kernel internals" section of Documentation/networking/filter.txt</a>
     for details. 
<p>
<li> The function tracer can now be used within multi-buffer trace
     instances, allowing each instance to trace a different set of function
     calls. 
<p>
<li> User-space probing with uprobes is now supported on the ARM
     architecture. 
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/589475/">per-thread VMA caching patch set</a>
     has been merged; it should improve memory management performance for a
     number of workloads.
<p>
<li> The zram compressed in-memory swap mechanism can now optionally use
     LZ4 compression.
<p>
<li> The Tile architecture now supports the perf events subsystem.
<p>
<li> Support for the ancient Unisys ES7000, IBM Summit/EXA, SGI Visual
     Workstation, and NUMAQ x86 subarchitectures has been removed, as has
     support for PowerPC-based Motorola PrPMC2800 boards.

	  Note that support for numerous ARM-based boards has also been
     	  added, but that support consists entirely of device tree

     </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Rather later than anybody might have expected, the <tt>sleep_on()</tt>
     family of functions has been removed from the kernel.
<p>
<li> There is a new "<tt>locktorture</tt>" module which performs various
     types of stress testing on kernel locking primitives.
<p>
<li> The kernel address-space layout randomization code has been extended
     to randomize the base address for loadable modules.  A single random
     offset is chosen once by the kernel and used with each module as it is
     loaded. 
<p>
<li> The arm64 architecture now has support for the KGDB kernel debugger.
<p>
<li> Basic CPU topology support has been added to the arm64 architecture,
     allowing the kernel to represent the system's architecture as described by
     the firmware.
<p>
<li> The <tt>PREPARE_WORK()</tt> and <tt>DELAYED_WORK()</tt> workqueue
     macros have been removed.  The interface was prone to subtle errors
     and was never used widely within the kernel.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/574962/">timer broadcast patches</a> have been
     merged, allowing the delivery of timer events to a sleeping CPU even
     if that CPU's timers stop while it is in the sleep state.
<p>
<li> The rewriting of the core control group code continues.  Changes
     merged this time around include a full transition to the new "kernfs"
     virtual filesystem for control files, some steps toward the unified
     hierarchy model, and the removal of the ability to build controllers
     as modules.
<p>
<li> There is a new method (<tt>map_pages()</tt>) in <tt>struct
     vm_operations_struct</tt>; its job is to perform opportunistic "fault
     around" mapping of pages, hopefully reducing page faults and improving
     performance.  Note that <tt>map_pages()</tt> is not allowed to block.
     The page cache uses this function to map surrounding pages on page
     faults.  A new debugfs knob (<tt>fault_around_order</tt>) enables
     playing with and tuning this functionality.
</ul>
<p>

The merge window can be expected to remain open until around
April&nbsp;13.  At this point, though, most of the major trees have been
pulled, so there probably will not be a lot of changes showing up in the
last few days.  Perhaps the biggest remaining question mark is the support
for link-time optimization (LTO).  This toolchain feature has the potential
to improve kernel performance while reducing its total size; this happens 
at the cost of an increased build time.  Linus is <a
href="/Articles/594038/">unconvinced</a> by the merits of this patch set
and is asking for more information.  A number of other developers have
asked for its inclusion, but it is not yet clear whether that will be
enough to turn the tide.

development cycle.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 3, 2007</br>
           </div>
Sparse files have an apparent size which is larger than the amount of
storage actually allocated to them.  The usual way to create such
a file is to seek past its end and write some new data; Unix-derived
systems will traditionally not allocate disk blocks for the portion of the
file past the previous end which was skipped over.  The result is a "hole,"
a piece of the file which logically exists, but which is not represented on
disk.  A read operation on a hole succeeds, with the returned data being
all zeroes.  Relatively smart file archival and backup utilities will
recognize holes in files; these holes are not stored in the resulting
archive and will not be filled if the file is restored from that archive.
<p>

The process of recognizing holes is relatively primitive, though: about the
only way to do it in a portable way is to simply look for blocks filled
with zeroes.  This technique works, but it requires making a pass over the
data to obtain information which the lower levels of the system already
know.  It seems like there should be a better way.
<p>

About two years ago, the Solaris ZFS developers <a
href="http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/entry/seek_hole_and_seek_data">proposed
an extension to <tt>lseek()</tt></a> which would allow an application to
find the holes in sparse files more efficiently.  This extension
works by adding two new "whence" options:
<P>
<ul>
<li> <tt>SEEK_HOLE</tt> positions the file descriptor to the beginning of 
     the first hole which occurs after the given offset.  For the purposes
     of this operation, "hole" is defined as a region of all zeros of any
     length, but the system is not required to actually detect all holes.
     So, in practice, small ranges of zeroes will be skipped over, as will,
     in all likelihood, large (multi-block) ranges which have actually been
     written to disk.  
<p>
<li> <tt>SEEK_DATA</tt> moves to the start of next region (after the given
     offset) which is not a hole.
</ul>
<p>
This functionality has been part of Solaris for a while; the Solaris
developers would like to see it spread elsewhere and become something more
than a Solaris-only extension.   To that end, Josef Bacik has recently
posted <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/260699/">an implementation</a> of
this extension for Linux.  Internally, it adds a new member to the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure (<tt>seek_hole_data()</tt>) intended to
allow filesystems to efficiently implement the new operations.
<p>

One might argue that anybody who wants to separate holes and data in a file
can already do so with the <tt>FIBMAP</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt> command.  While
that is true, <tt>FIBMAP</tt> is an inefficient way of getting
this sort of information, especially on filesystems which support extents.
A <tt>FIBMAP</tt> call returns the mapping information for exactly one
block; mapping out a large file may require millions of calls when, once
again, the filesystem should already know how to provide that information
in a much more straightforward manner.
<p>
Even so, this patch looks relatively unlikely to make it into the
mainline.  The API is unpopular, being seen as ugly and as a change in the
semantics of the <tt>lseek()</tt> call.  But, more to the point, it may be
interesting to learn much more about the representation of a file than just
where the holes are.  And, as it turns out, there is already a proposed
<tt>ioctl()</tt> command which can provide all of that information.  That
interface is the <a href="/Articles/260803/"><tt>FIEMAP</tt>
<tt>ioctl()</tt></a> specified by Andreas Dilger back in October.
<p>

A <tt>FIEMAP</tt> call takes the following structure as an argument:
<p>
<pre>
    struct fiemap {
	__u64	fm_start;	 /* logical starting byte offset (in/out) */
	__u64	fm_length;	 /* logical length of map (in/out) */
	__u32	fm_flags;	 /* FIEMAP_FLAG_* flags for request (in/out) */
	__u32	fm_extent_count; /* number of extents in fm_extents (in/out) */
	__u64	fm_end_offset;	 /* end of mapping in last ioctl */
	struct fiemap_extent	fm_extents[0];
    };
</pre>
<p>
An application wanting to learn something about how a file is stored will
put the starting offset  into <tt>fm_start</tt> and the length
of the region of interest in <tt>fm_length</tt>.  If <tt>fm_flags</tt>
contains <tt>FIEMAP_FLAG_NUM_EXTENTS</tt>, the system call will simply set
<tt>fm_extent_count</tt> to the number of extents used to store the
specified range of bytes and return.  In this form, <tt>FIEMAP</tt> can be
used to determine how fragmented the file is on disk.
<p>
If the application is looking for more information than that, it will
allocate enough space for one or more <tt>fm_extents</tt> structures:
<p>
<pre>
    struct fiemap_extent {
    	__u64 fe_offset;/* offset in bytes for the start of the extent */
    	__u64 fe_length;/* length in bytes for the extent */
    	__u32 fe_flags; /* returned FIEMAP_EXTENT_* flags for the extent */
    	__u32 fe_lun;   /* logical device number for extent(starting at 0)*/
    };
</pre>
<p>
In this case, <tt>fm_extent_count</tt> should be set to the number of these
structures before making the <tt>FIEMAP</tt> call.  On return, these
structures (as many as is indicated by the returned value of
<tt>fm_extent_count</tt>) will be filled in with information on the actual
file extents; <tt>fe_offset</tt> says where (on disk) the extent starts,
and <tt>fe_length</tt> is the size of the extent.  There are quite a few
values which can appear in the <tt>fe_flags</tt> field:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_HOLE</tt> says that there is no data for this 
     range of the file - it's a hole.
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_UNWRITTEN</tt> says that the space has been
     allocated on disk, but that nothing has been written to that space.
     Space which has been preallocated with <tt>fallocate()</tt> would be
     marked this way.
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_UNMAPPED</tt>, instead, marks an extent where some
     application has written data, but for which no disk blocks have been
     allocated.
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_DELALLOC</tt> indicates that delayed allocation is
     being done; this flag implies <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_UNMAPPED</tt> as well.
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_SECONDARY</tt> is an indication that the data for
     this segment is in some sort of secondary storage; one would see this
     flag on filesystems managed by some sort of hierarchical storage
     manner.  This flag, too, is likely to imply
     <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_UNMAPPED</tt>. 
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_NO_DIRECT</tt> says that the data cannot be accessed
     directly - it requires processing (decompression or decryption, for
     example) first.
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_LAST</tt> marks the final extent in a file.
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_EOF</tt> indicates that the requested range goes
     beyond the end of the file.
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_ERROR</tt> marks an extent which has experienced some
     sort of error; the <tt>fe_offset</tt> field will contain an error
     number in this case.
<p>
<li> <tt>FIEMAP_EXTENT_UNKNOWN</tt> says that the data exists, but its
     location is unknown.  This flag would describe much of your editor's
     personal file space, though it is unclear how the kernel would know
     that. 
</ul>
<p>

As can be seen, there is a wealth of information available from this new
call, including details on how the file has been split up on disk,
allocation strategies, and even the decisions made by a hierarchical
storage engine.  An implementation exists for the ext4 filesystem.  None of
this code has been pushed toward the mainline yet, but it would be
surprising if that did not happen sometime in the relatively near future.
Once that is done, the C library will be able to implement
<tt>SEEK_HOLE</tt> and <tt>SEEK_DATA</tt> in user space, should that be
desirable.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

 Such an implementation at:
<a href="http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/g/gu/gujin/gujin-2.3.tar.gz/gujin/showmap.c?extract=true">http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.n...</a>
executable at:
<a href="http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/g/gu/gujin/install-2.3.tar.gz/install/showmap?extract=true">http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.n...</a>
 That can be used to count the level of fragmentation of a filesystem, with some interresting
results.
 The main problem is that some filesystems do not implement it correctly or at all (so LILO or
Gujin cannot be installed on them).
 The other problem, for the case of a bootloader, is that it does not give the position of the
data in the disk but in the device, and there is a big difference when the device is a RAID or
LVM.

 The thing the bootloader has to do is to register where its own code/data are on disk to be
able to load them without the kernel support, and to have only one file, to write the position
of the end of the file at the beginning of itself, so to have block allocated to disk before
the write into the file is finished - possible but tricky.

      <p>It's much cleaner to have the boot loader use the proper directories, block maps, etc. to access the filesystem.  GRUB does this.

<p>In its usual deployment, GRUB still has the problem because that code that knows how to access the filesystem is <em>in</em> the filesystem, and the only way GRUB knows to find it is with built-in block numbers.  

<p>But it's possible to put that code outside the filesystem, in an area of disk reserved for that purpose, and then the world is as it should be.  You don't need any special kernel interfaces at boot loader installation time, and you don't have to take care to keep the blocks from moving after you've installed the boot loader.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; It's much cleaner to have the boot loader use the proper directories, block maps, etc. to

 So does Gujin - smaller number of filesystem supported, I have to say.

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; In its usual deployment, GRUB still has the problem because that code that knows how to

 By default Gujin puts that code at the end of the disk, outside of any filesystem, but it not
always available depending on the tool used to create the partitions (Linux tools are used to
fill the whole disk - not leaving a single unallocated sector for the bootloader).
&lt;/rant&gt;

 Doesn't change that it would be nice to have a kernel interface which maps the device block
into a hard disk block, for that part of the bootloader which shall not move when it is on a
filesystem (RAID and LVM problem).
 It would also be nice to have an interface to tell the filesystem that this file is the boot
code - there is an inode reserved for that in EXT2/3FS but no way to use it.

Wonder why good ole' partitions are out of fashion?

Rather than having the ability for applications to do nasty things and 
become dependant on physical block numbers, which prevent copying of files 
around.   You could use a raw partition, and then copy the blocks into 
known offsets from the beginning of the partition.  This seems much 
simpler.

Presumbably a BootFS, with a boot loader friendly structure might also be 
a robust alternative and avoid duplication, of files in the raw partition 
approach.

      <p>"... the Solaris ZFS developers proposed an extension to lseek() which ..."</p>

<p>Within the above article fragment, the "proposed an extension to lseek()" link points to:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/entry/seek_hole_and_seek_data">http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/entry/seek_hole_and_seek_data</a></li>
</ul>

which currently just redirects to the 404 page:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/roller-ui/errors/404.jsp">https://blogs.oracle.com/roller-ui/errors/404.jsp</a></li>
</ul>

However, it looks like the original (2012-05-05) blog entry is now available here:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/bonwick/seekhole-and-seekdata-for-sparse-files">https://blogs.oracle.com/bonwick/seekhole-and-seekdata-for-sparse-files</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>(I'm assuming it is the same blog entry -- same author, same timeframe, same subject -- corrections or confirmations welcome.)</p>

I could course at Oracle all day long for the huge list of links (to high-quality content) they've killed overnight. There are countless links to useful Sun-era documents in mailing list archives and newgroups and Oracle just broke them all without thinking twice. If that's not evil, what is? But then, lawnmower etc.<br>

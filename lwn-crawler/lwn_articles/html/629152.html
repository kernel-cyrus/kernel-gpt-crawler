           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 13, 2015</br>
           <hr>
<a href="/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2015-linux.conf.au">LCA 2015</a>
</div>
Following up on <a href="/Articles/629155/">Jesper Brouer's session on
networking 
performance</a>, Christoph Lameter's LCA kernel miniconf session covered ways
in which the performance of the kernel's low-level object allocators (the
"slab" allocators) could be improved to meet current and future demands.
Some of the work he covered is new, but some of it has been around, in concept at
least, for some time.
<p>
<h4>Batch allocation</h4>
<p>
Jesper talked about the need to process packets in batches; that, in turn,
leads to the need to allocate and free data structures in batches.  The
overhead of a single-object allocation is too high for the needs of the
networking subsystem, but, if that overhead
can be spread out over a large numbers of objects, it becomes more
tolerable.  Christoph's work, which was <a
href="/Articles/629356/">posted</a> to the linux-kernel 
list for review in December, provides an interface for multiple-object
allocation.
<p>
To allocate a set of objects from a slab cache, one would call:
<p>
<pre>
    kmem_cache_alloc_array(struct kmem_cache *cache, gfp_t gfp, int nr,
    			   void **objects, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
If all goes well, this function will allocate <tt>nr</tt> objects, placing
pointers to them in the <tt>objects</tt> array.
<p>
The <tt>flags</tt> argument is there to support a few different modes of
allocation.  <tt>SLAB_ARRAY_ALLOC_LOCAL</tt> says to allocate the objects
from a local, per-CPU array.  Allocation is lockless and quite fast, but
there is a limited number of objects available from this cache.  Larger
batches can be allocated with <tt>SLAB_ARRAY_ALLOC_PARTIAL</tt>, which
tries to grab the objects from the per-CPU list of partially-allocated
pages.  This mode may be a bit slower, but it avoids draining the per-CPU
object cache.  Finally, large numbers of objects can be allocated with
<tt>SLAB_ARRAY_ALLOC_NEW</tt>, which allocates objects from freshly
allocated pages.
<p>
That last mode may seem especially slow since it requires calls into the page
allocator.  But, for large batches, Christoph said, it could actually be
the fastest mode of them all.  Normally the SLUB allocator (which Christoph
maintains) must manipulate the free list of objects used in the management
of slab pages; working with fresh pages avoids that need, and, in the
process, cuts out a lot of cache misses associated with list traversal.
The cost, in the current 
implementation, is that only full pages of objects can be allocated, so the
returned number of objects may be less than what was asked for.  Dave
Chinner said that such an interface may be be useful in the filesystem
layer, but the allocator would have to return the requested number of
objects, so that behavior might change in the future.
<p>
Objects can also be freed in batches, using:
<p>
<pre>
    kmem_cache_free_array(struct kmem_cache *cache, int nr, void **objects);
</pre>
<p>
The current plan is to add this array-allocation API with a fallback mode
for slab allocators that do not support it.  That allows testing the
API without the need to implement it in all three allocators
supported by the kernel.
<p>
Implementation of this API in the SLUB allocator is done.  The biggest
challenge is the manipulation of the free lists, which can add a lot of
cache misses to an allocation operation.  As mentioned above, allocation
using fresh pages avoids that problem, since the free list need never exist
in the first place.  Implementation in the slab allocator is easier, since
it already maintains a per-page array of free objects; there is no free
list to traverse.  There was no mention of the SLOB allocator, but SLOB
users are not primarily focused on performance anyway.
<p>
<h4>Fixing slab fragmentation</h4>
<p>
The second part of Christoph's talk had to do with slab page fragmentation
issues.  All of the slab allocators work by allocating full pages, breaking
them up into equal-sized objects, then passing those objects out to the the rest
of the kernel on request.  One result of this strategy is that, over time,
the allocators accumulate lists of partially allocated pages â€” pages with

<a href="/Articles/629277/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2015/lca/ChristophLameter-sm.jpg" width=200 height=250
border=0 alt="[Christoph Lameter]" title="Christoph Lameter" hspace=3
vspace=3 align="left"></a>

some objects allocated, and others free.  These fragmented pages are costly
to track; they also represent a fair amount of wasted memory that cannot be
freed for other uses.  There would be value in a mechanism that could free
some of these partially allocated pages.
<p>
There are a number of patches out there addressing parts of the
fragmentation problem.  The first of these takes a
relatively simple approach: the lists of partially allocated
pages are sorted to put those with the fewest free objects at the
beginning.  The hope is that subsequent allocation requests will allocate
the last remaining objects in
those pages, at which point the allocator can stop tracking them.  At the
other end of the list, the pages which contain few allocated objects will, with
luck and 
if further objects are not allocated from them, become fully free when the
remaining objects are returned.  Those pages can then be handed back to the
page allocator.
<p>
The next step is off-node allocation.  The slab allocators normally try to
keep memory allocations on the same NUMA node as the requester.  But, on
occasion, the SLUB allocator will allocate from a remote node in the hope
of clearing some partially-allocated pages from that node.  This off-node
access happens relatively rarely, and only if the allocation request does
not explicitly ask for node-local memory.  But, carefully used, it can help
to get mostly-allocated pages off the partial-page lists.
<p>
A more invasive approach is what Christoph called "defragmentation by
eviction."  It was first posed in 2009, but was rejected at the time.  It
allows callbacks to be associated with objects allocated from a slab
cache.  There are two of these: <tt>get()</tt> and <tt>kick()</tt>.  A call
to <tt>get()</tt> establishes a stable reference to an object so that it
will not be freed while the allocator is trying to free the entire page.  A call to
<tt>kick()</tt>, instead, requests that the object be freed.  The callback
can refuse to free the object, but, clearly, the mechanism will work better
if these requests are honored whenever possible.  After all, it only takes
one refused request to thwart an attempt to free a page.
<p>
Finally, Christoph mentioned that, sometime in the future, there will be a
need to support movable objects in the slab caches.  Much work has gone
into making memory pages movable; at this point, the slab caches represent
the bulk of unmovable pages in the system.  Solving that problem will not
be easy, Christoph said, but it may, in the end, be the only way to truly
solve the problem of slab page fragmentation.

What happened to the free_hot_page()/free_cold_page() and allocating hot (cache-wise) area for use by the processor and cold (cache-wise) to do DMA by another device?<br>
DMA from/to a cold area should be quicker because of reduced memory subsystem traffic, assuming constant TLB cache behaviour...<br>

I think a separate list for objects that will be gone soon, in this case 120ns, would be a better idea so the same small number of pages can be reused over and over quickly.<br>

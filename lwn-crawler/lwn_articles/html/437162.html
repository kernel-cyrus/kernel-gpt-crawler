<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 6, 2011</br>
           </div>
The Linux kernel supports a wide variety of architectures, some of which
are more prominent than others.  The ARM architecture does not usually draw
a lot of attention, but, over the years, it has become one of the most
important architectures for Linux.  There's now a vast array of embedded
devices which run Linux because the kernel runs well on ARM.  So when the
mailing lists see extended and heated discussions about the quality of the
ARM architecture code, it's worth paying attention.
<p>
It all started early in the 2.6.39 merge window when Linus <a
href="/Articles/437170/">objected</a> to one of many pull requests for an
ARM subarchitecture.  He complained about excessive churn in the
architecture, duplicated code, board-specific data encoded in source files,
and conflicts between different merge requests.  Much of that
board-specific data, he says, should be pulled out of the kernel and into
the boot loader; others have suggested that device trees could solve much
of that problem.  Meanwhile, it is impossible to build a kernel which runs
on a wide variety of ARM systems, and that, <a href="/Articles/437172/">he
says</a>,  is a problem for the platform as a whole:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Why? Think of the Ubuntu's etc of the world. If you can't make
	half-way generic install images, you can't have a reasonably
	generic distribution. And if you don't have that, then what happens
	to your developer situation? Most sane people won't touch it with a
	ten-foot pole, because the bother is simply not worth their time.
</div>
<p>
There actually seems to be a bit of a consensus on what the sources of the
problems with the ARM architecture are.  The hardware itself varies widely
from one chip to the next; each vendor's system-on-chip offerings are
inconsistent with each other, and even more so with other vendors'
products.  According to Nicolas Pitre, the openness of Linux has helped to
make ARM successful, but <a href="/Articles/437184/">is also part of the
problem</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	On ARM you have no prepackaged "real" Windows.  That let hardware
	people try things.  So they do change the hardware platform all the
	time to gain some edge.  And this is no problem for them because
	most of the time they have access to the OS source code and they
	modify it themselves directly. No wonder why Linux is so popular on
	ARM. I'm sure hardware designers really enjoy this freedom.
</div>
<p>
So the ARM architecture is a massive collection of "subplatforms,"
each one of those subplatforms is managed independently, often
by different developers, and few of those developers have the time for or
interest in doing cross-platform architecture work.  The result is a lot of
code flux, many duplicated drivers, and lots of hacks.
<p>
Complicating the situation is the simple fact that the kernel is a victim
of its own success.  For years developers have been beating on the embedded
industry to work upstream and to get its code into the kernel.  Now the
industry is doing exactly that; the result is a <i>lot</i> of code, not all
of which is as nice as we would like.  The fact that a lot of embedded
vendors seem to have little long-term vision or interest in solving
anything but immediate problems makes things worse.  The result is code
that "works for now," but which is heading toward a long-term maintenance
disaster.
<p>
How is this problem to be solved?  It seems clear that the ARM architecture
needs more maintainers who are concerned with cross-platform issues and
improving the state of ARM support as a whole.  There would appear to be a
consensus that ARM maintainer Russell King is doing a good job with the
core code, and there are a few people (Nicolas Pitre, Catalin Marinas, Tony
Lindgren, etc.) who are trying to bring some order to the subplatform mess,
but they seem to be unable to contain the problem.  As <a
href="/Articles/437178/">Nicolas</a> put it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So we need help!  If core kernel people could get off their X86
	stool and get down in the ARM mud to help sort out this mess that
	would be really nice (thanks tglx).  Until then all that the few of
	us can do is to contain the flood and hope for the best, and so far
	things being as they are have still worked surprisingly well in
	practice for users....
	<p>
	And we can't count on vendor people doing this work.  They are all busy 
	porting the kernel to their next SOC version so they can win the next 
	big Android hardware design, and doing so with our kernel quality 
	standards is already quite a struggle for them.
</div>
<p>
There are some developers who are willing to provide at least some of that
help.  The Linaro project could also conceivably take on a role here.  But
that still leaves open the question of just how the code can be cleaned
up.  Arnd Bergmann has <a href="/Articles/437181/">suggested</a> the
radical step of creating a new ARM architecture tree with a new, clean,
design, then moving support over to it.  Eventually the older code would
either fade away, or it would only be used to support older hardware.

Creating a new architecture tree seems like a big step, but it has been
done before - more than once.  The x86-64 architecture was essentially a
clean start from x86; the two platforms were then eventually merged back
together into a much cleaner tree.  PowerPC support went through a similar
process. 
<p>
Whether that will happen with ARM remains to be seen; there are other
developers who would rather perform incremental cleanups on the existing
ARM tree.  Either way, the first step will have to be finding developers
who are willing to do the work.  There is no shortage of developers who are
interested in ARM, but fewer of them are willing and able to do high-level
architectural work - and to deal with the inevitable resistance to change.
As <a href="/Articles/437183/">Thomas Gleixner said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The only problem is to find a person, who is willing to do that,
	has enough experience, broad shoulders and a strong accepted
	voice. Not to talk about finding someone who is willing to pay a
	large enough compensation for pain and suffering.
</div>
<p>

So there are some challenges to overcome.  But there is also a great deal
of economic value to the ARM platform, a lot of people working in that
area, and a reasonably common understanding of where the problems are.  So
chances are good that some sort of solution will be found.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Just to clarify: My suggestion was not to create a new architecture tree to replace the entire ARM code, but to create a new subarchitecture along with the existing ones inside of the ARM architecture tree.<br>
<p>
There is no need to duplicate the core code for this, but I think a lot of social problems stem from the fact that every subarchitecture currently acts as a separate universe with very little incentive for subarchitecture maintainers to work together. Having just a single subarchitecture for all modern SoCs would force people to care about the quality of the other company's code.<br>

"a single subarchitecture for all modern SoCs" <br>
<p>
Perhaps I don't see how this all fits together. I am interested. <br>
<p>
Each SoC differs in varying degrees. And is integrated into boards which differ in varying degrees. Which connects to a variety subcomponents.<br>
<p>
Just about anybody who uses a board ends up being a kernel developer, writing SPI driver code if nothing else. There is a huge variation in skill. I don't see how a single subarchitecture can ever keep up with the growth in variations. <br>
<p>
I would be happy if each variation was a branch, with branch maintainers.<br>

There are multiple things currently in per-subarchitecture trees:<br>
<p>
* Board specific code:<br>
Should not really be needed as much, and does not hurt cross-subarchitecture integration.<br>
<p>
* Device drivers (irq, timer, iommu, gpio):<br>
Are well abstracted, have any number of them. These are most significant hardware differences, but they don't need to be hardcoded at all.<br>
<p>
* Duplicated infrastructure files:<br>
This is what we want to get rid of really. E.g. all the mach/*.h header files keep us from building a single kernel for all SoCs, so we should remove them.<br>

I think what the discussion has shown is that a number of drivers are not well written and could be made more generic rather than duplicated. They are however reasonably well abstracted in the way that it's possible to exchange e.g. one interrupt controller for another one and have everything else still work.<br>
<p>
There are still areas that need a lot of improvement here, but it's not standing in the way of generalizing the subarchitectures.<br>

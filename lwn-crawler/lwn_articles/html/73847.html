<h1>A retry-based AIO infrastructure</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted March 2, 2004 by corbet]

<div class="ArticleText">
The asynchronous I/O infrastructure was added in 2.5 as a way to allow
processes to initiate I/O operations without having to wait for their
completion.  The underlying mechanism is documented in <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/24366/">this Driver Porting Series
article</a>.  The actual implementation of asynchronous I/O in the kernel
has been somewhat spotty, however.  It works for some devices (which have
specifically implemented that support) and for direct file I/O.  Other
sorts of potentially interesting uses, such as with regular buffered file
I/O, have remained unimplemented.
<p>
Part of the problem is that buffered file I/O integrates deeply with the
page cache and virtual memory subsystem.  It is not all that easy to graft
asynchronous I/O operations into those complex bodies of code.  So the
kernel developers have, for the most part, simply punted on cases like
that.
<p>
Suparna Bhattacharya, however, has not given up so easily.  For over a
year, now, she has been working on a set of patches which bring the
asynchronous mode to the buffered I/O realm.  <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/72678/">A new set of patches</a> has
recently been posted which trims down the buffered AIO changes to the bare
minimum.  So this seems like a good time to take a look at what is involved
in making asynchronous buffered I/O work.
<p>

The architecture implemented by these patches is based on retries.  When an
asynchronous file operation is requested, the code gets things started and
goes as far as it can until something would block; at that point it makes a
note and returns to the caller.  Later, when the roadblock has been taken
care of, the operation is retried until the next blocking point is hit.
Eventually, all the work gets done and user space can be notified that the
requested operation is complete.  The initial work is done in the context
of the process which first requested the operation; the retries are handled
out of a workqueue.
<p>

For things to work in this mode, kernel code in the buffered I/O path must
be taught not to block when it is working on an asynchronous request.  The
first step in this direction is the concept of an asynchronous wait queue
entry.  Wait queue entries are generally used, surprisingly, for waiting;
they include a pointer to the process which is to be awakened when the wait
is complete.  With the AIO retry patch, a wait queue entry which has a
<tt>NULL</tt> process pointer is taken to mean that actually waiting is not
desired.  When this type of wait queue entry is encountered, functions like
<tt>prepare_to_wait()</tt> will not put the process into a sleeping state
(though it does add the wait queue entry to the associated wait queue),
and some functions will return the new error code <tt>-EIOCBRETRY</tt>
rather than actually sleeping.
<p>
The next step is to add a new <tt>io_wait</tt> entry to the task
structure.  When AIO retries are being performed, that entry is pointed to
an asynchronous wait queue entry associated with the specific AIO request.  
This task structure field is, for all practical purposes, being used in a
hackish manner to pass the wait queue entry into functions deep inside the
virtual memory subsystem.  It might have been clearer to pass it explicitly
as a parameter, but that would require changing large numbers of internal
interfaces to support a rarely-used functionality.  The <tt>io_wait</tt>
solution is arguably less clean, but it also makes for a far less invasive patch.
It does mean, however, that work can only proceed on a single AIO request
at a time.
<p>
Finally, a few low-level functions have been patched to note the existence
of a special wait queue entry in the <tt>io_wait</tt> field and to use it
instead of the local entry that would normally have been used.  In
particular, page cache functions like <tt>wait_on_page_locked()</tt> and
<tt>wait_on_page_writeback()</tt> have been modified in this way.  These
functions are normally used to wait until file I/O has been completed on a
page; they are the point where buffered I/O often blocks.  When AIO is
being performed, instead, they will return the <tt>-EIOCBRETRY</tt> error
code immediately.
<p>
The AIO code also takes advantage of the fact that wait queue entries, in
2.6, contain a pointer to the function to be called to wake up the waiting
process.  With an asynchronous request, there may be no
such process; instead, the kernel needs to attempt the next retry.  So the
AIO code sets up its own wakeup function which does not actually wake any
processes, but which does restart the relevant I/O request.
<p>
Once that structure is in place, all that's left is a bit of housekeeping
code to keep track of the status of the request between retries.  This work
is done entirely within the AIO layer; as each piece of the request is
satisfied, the request itself as seen by the filesystem layer is modified
to take that into account.  When the operation is retried to transfer the
next chunk of data, it looks like a new request with the already-done
portion removed.  
<p>
Add in a few other hacks (telling the readahead code about the entire AIO
request, for example, and an AIO implementation for pipes) and the patch
set is complete.  It does not attempt to fix every spot which might block
(that would be a large task), but it should take care of the most important
ones.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
Hmm... and I thought the point of AIO was to be able to just fire off dozens of IO requests and not bother until some of them signal completion. What am I missing here?

      Perhaps I didn't express that quite as well as I could have.  What it means is that the kernel can be actively working on only one request per process at a time.  There can be several requests with I/O outstanding, but, once the CPU's attention is required, only one at a time can be worked on, even on multiprocessor systems.

      I figured that. Yet the term &quot;asynchronous&quot; suggests to me that the requests should be progressing independently - not the kind of serialized behavior that you describe. What if that current request is progressing slowly (think a floppy) and others in the queue never get worked on until it's completed?<p>My impression is that it should have been the other way around: instead of implementing AIO on top of buffered IO, asynchronous requests should be the basic IO primitive and all other IO should be implemented on top of that. I can't oversee what that'd imply for the page cache, though.<br>

I think the thread that is handling accessing a floppy is going to be asleep almost all the time, so there will be plenty of time for other threads to wake up, do some stuff, and either finish or go back to sleep themselves.

      What are you referring to as a &quot;thread&quot;? An AIO request? How can other AIO requests &quot;wake up, do some stuff&quot; if the kernel is still handling the floppy request which blocks the single AIO entry for the process?<p>Guess I must read the code myself.<p>I may have put my concern in the wrong words though. One idea I have about AIO is that you can have an application behave like a multithreaded application with a singe thread. Instead of creating threads for certain IO tasks you just fire off AIO requests and they _proceed simultaneously_, as if they were driven by different threads. I wonder  how that'd be possible with the serialized approach described here. Perhaps the whole notion is wrong, though?<br>

<p>
Most of the (wall clock) time the kernel is handling the floppy request is going to be spent sleeping (waiting for the floppy device), and while that request is sleeping  another request can proceed until it either completes or has to wait for a device (sleep).

      I'm not sure I read this correctly, but I don't think we have that kind of a limitation in the code. A workqueue thread's tsk-&gt;io_wait pointer is set to the address of the ki_wait field inside the iocb that it is handling at that particular time. There is no reason why a worker thread on another CPU cannot process another iocb, by setting its own tsk-&gt;io_wait pointer to point to another iocb's ki_wait. The point to notice here is that in these situations &quot;tsk&quot; refers to the task which is processing the iocb at a given time (not the task which originally issued the IO), and the io_wait pointer reflects the wait context of the iocb on whose behalf, so to say, the code is being executed.<p>That said, it may sometimes be more efficient not to have worker threads on multiple CPUs trying to process iocbs for the same ioctx at the same time (reduces spinlock bouncing on the ioctx lock, as observed by Chris Mason).<p>Hope that clarifies !

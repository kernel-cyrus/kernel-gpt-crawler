<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>January 19, 2011</br>
           </div>
The memory management unit in almost any contemporary processor can handle
multiple page sizes, but the Linux kernel almost always restricts itself to
just the smallest of those sizes - 4096 bytes on most architectures.  Pages
which are larger than that minimum - collectively called "huge pages" - can
offer better performance for some workloads, but that performance benefit
has gone mostly unexploited on Linux.  That may change in 2.6.38, though,
with the merging of the transparent huge page feature.
<p>
Huge pages can improve performance through reduced page faults (a single
fault brings in a large chunk of memory at once) and by reducing the cost
of virtual to physical address translation (fewer levels of page tables
must be traversed to get to the physical address).  But the real advantage
comes from avoiding translations altogether.  If the processor must
translate a virtual address, it must go through as many as four levels of
page tables, each of which has a good chance of being cache-cold, and,
thus, slow.  For this reason, processors maintain a "translation lookaside
buffer" (TLB) to cache the results of translations.  The TLB is often quite
small; running <tt>cpuid</tt> on your editor's aging desktop machine yields:
<p>
<pre>
   cache and TLB information (2):
      0xb1: instruction TLB: 2M/4M, 4-way, 4/8 entries
      0xb0: instruction TLB: 4K, 4-way, 128 entries
      0x05: data TLB: 4M pages, 4-way, 32 entries
</pre>
<p>
So there is room for 128 instruction translations, and 32 data
translations.  Such a small cache is easily overrun, forcing the CPU to
perform large numbers of address translations.  A single 2MB huge page
requires a single TLB entry; the same memory, in 4KB pages, would need 512
TLB entries.  Given that, it's not surprising that the use of huge pages
can make programs run faster.
<p>
The main kernel address space is mapped with huge pages, reducing TLB
pressure from kernel code.  The only way for user-space to take advantage
of huge pages in current kernels, though, is through the hugetlbfs, which
was <a href="/Articles/374424/">extensively documented</a> here in early
2010.  Using hugetlbfs requires significant work from both application
developers and system administrators; huge pages must be set aside at boot
time, and applications must map them explicitly.  The process is fiddly
enough that use of hugetlbfs is restricted to those who really care and who
have the time to mess with it.  Hugetlbfs is often seen as a feature for
large, proprietary database management systems and little else.
<p>
There would be real value in a mechanism which would make the use of huge
pages easy, preferably requiring no development or administrative attention
at all.  That is the goal of the transparent huge pages (THP) patch, which was
written by Andrea Arcangeli and merged for 2.6.38.  In short, THP tries to
make huge pages "just happen" in situations where they would be useful.
<p>
Current Linux kernels assume that all pages found within a given virtual
memory area (VMA) will be the same size.  To make THP work, Andrea had to
start by getting rid of that assumption; thus, much of the initial part of
the patch series is dedicated to enabling mixed page sizes within a VMA.
Then the patch modifies the page fault handler in a simple way: when a
fault happens, the kernel will attempt to allocate a huge page to satisfy
it.  Should the allocation succeed, the huge page will be filled, any
existing small pages in the new page's address range will be released, and
the huge page will be inserted 
into the VMA.  If no huge pages are available, the kernel falls back to
small pages and the application never knows the difference.
<p>
This scheme will increase the use of huge pages transparently, but it does
not yet solve the whole problem.  Huge pages must be swappable, lest the
system run out of memory in a hurry.  Rather than complicate the swapping
code with an understanding of huge pages, Andrea simply splits a huge page
back into its component small pages if that page needs to be reclaimed.
Many other operations (<tt>mprotect()</tt>, <tt>mlock()</tt>, ...) will
also result in the splitting of a page.
<p>
The allocation of huge pages depends on the availability of large,
physically-contiguous chunks of memory - something which Linux kernel
programmers can never count on.  It is to be expected that those pages will
become available at inconvenient times - just after a process has faulted
in a number of small pages, for example.  The THP patch tries to improve
this situation through the addition of a "khugepaged" kernel thread.  That
thread will occasionally attempt to allocate a huge page; if it succeeds,
it will scan through memory looking for a place where that huge page can be
substituted for a bunch of smaller pages.  Thus, available huge pages
should be quickly placed into service, maximizing the use of huge pages in
the system as a whole.
<p>
The current patch only works with anonymous pages; the work to integrate
huge pages with the page cache has not yet been done.  It also only handles
one huge page size (2MB).  Even so, some useful
performance improvements can be seen.  Mel Gorman <a
href="/Articles/423590/">ran some benchmarks</a> showing improvements of up
to 10% or so in some situations.  In general, the results were not as good
as could be obtained with hugetlbfs, but THP is much more likely to
actually be used.
<p>
No application changes need to be made to take advantage of THP, but
interested application developers can try to optimize their use of it.  A
call to <tt>madvise()</tt> with the <tt>MADV_HUGEPAGE</tt> flag will mark a
memory range as being especially suited to huge pages, while
<tt>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</tt> will suggest that huge pages are better used
elsewhere.  For applications that want to use huge pages, use of
<tt>posix_memalign()</tt> can help to ensure that large allocations are
aligned to huge page (2MB) boundaries.
<p>
System administrators have a number of knobs that they can tweak, all found
under <tt>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage</tt>.  The <tt>enabled</tt>
value can be set to "<tt>always</tt>" (to always use THP),
"<tt>madvise</tt>" (to use huge pages only in VMAs marked with
<tt>MADV_HUGEPAGE</tt>), or "<tt>never</tt>" (to disable the feature).
Another knob, <tt>defrag</tt>, takes the same values; it controls whether
the kernel should make aggressive use of <a href="/Articles/368869/">memory
compaction</a> to make more huge pages available.  There's also a whole set
of parameters controlling the operation of the khugepaged thread; see <a
href="/Articles/423592/">Documentation/vm/transhuge.txt</a> for all the
details.
<p>
The THP patch has had a bit of a rough ride since being merged into the
mainline.  This code never appeared in linux-next, so it surprised some
architecture maintainers when it caused build failures in the mainline.
Some bugs have also been found - unsurprising for a patch which is this
large and which affects so much core code.  Those problems are being ironed
out, so, while 2.6.38-rc1 testers might want to be careful, THP should be
in a usable state by the time the final 2.6.38 kernel is released.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Huge pages can increase data cache performance by making aliasing (the mapping of address to cache set) more uniform within the huge page, in contrast to the mappings for many equivalent collections of small pages. The difference can be several percent or more.<br>

Transparent hugepage support is very interesting at the moment -- especially because both main x86 vendors are beefing up the support for them in their processors. Intel just added real support for 1GiB pages, but AMD takes the jackpot with the DTLB in the upcoming Bulldozer -- 72 L1 entries and 1024 L2 entries, holding any combination of 4kiB, 2MiB or 1GiB pages.<br>

I think the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/368869/">memory compaction patch</a> is intended to fix that: 
<blockquote><i>Mel ran some simple tests showing that, with compaction enabled, he was able to allocate over 90% of the system's memory as huge pages while simultaneously decreasing the amount of reclaim activity needed. </i></blockquote>

The presence of contiguous memory will be entirely dependant on the system and work load.  You are correct that allocating huge pages becomes more difficult as memory is fragmented.  My reply was to the section of the article that said hugetlbfs based huge pages must be set aside at boot time which is not correct for all page sizes.  On systems that support them, 1GB and 16GB pages must be reserved at boot, but 2MB, 4MB, and 16MB pages can be allocated any time there is contiguous space.<br>

Hugepages are a big deal for Mobile SoCs. Designers preallocate large chunks of physical memory to ensure that their encode/decode blocks operate on contiguous memory. This large memory gets locked out of the system forever. This leads to increased system costs because manufactures need to put down more memory than they'd like to. <br>
<p>
Some SoC manufactures have started using IOMMUs to map memory, but they're running up against TLB depth which they solve by using hugepages instead of regular pages. This support should allow these IOMMUs to map memory at runtime with hugepages and theoretically allow manufactures to use less memory. Of course that won't happen since hugepages are very scarce. <br>

I wrote an IOMMU prototype that used its own allocator and presented it at OLS in 2010, The Virtual Contiguous Memory Manager. I think the Samsung guys put together something based on its ideas.       <br>

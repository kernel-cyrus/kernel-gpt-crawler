<h1>Reverse mapping anonymous pages - again</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
Two weeks ago, this page <a href="/Articles/74295/">described Andrea
Arcangeli's "anon_vma" work</a> in some detail.  This work, remember, is an
attempt to improve memory scalability in the kernel by eliminating the
reverse mapping ("rmap") chains used to find page table entries which
reference a given page.  The rmap chains can use significant amounts of low
memory and can slow down <tt>fork()</tt> calls, so this work is of
interest. 
<p>
Andrea has continued pushing the anon_vma effort through a series of kernel
tree releases.  The latest, <a href="/Articles/77050/">2.6.5-rc2-aa2</a>,
solves some of the remaining problems and comes with this statement:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The next target is the merging of the prio_tree, but that will be a
	separated patch. After that this whole thing should be mergeable
	into mainline.
</div>
<p>
(The prio_tree reference is about Rajesh Venkatasubramanian's <a
href="/Articles/76621/">priority tree patch</a> which speeds the search for
interesting virtual memory areas when a page is mapped a large number of
times). 
<p>
Andrea's work is proceeding nicely, but it's worth
noting that anon_vma is not the only approach to the implementation of an
object-based reverse mapping scheme for anonymous memory.  There is
competition in the form of "anonmm" by Hugh Dickins.  Hugh has recently
reworked the patch and posted it for comments; interested parties can find
this (multi-part) posting in the "patches" section below.
<p>

The anon_vma patch works by creating a linked list of virtual memory areas
(VMAs) which reference a given page.  The anonmm patch, instead, creates a
connection between an anonymous page and the <tt>mm_struct</tt> structures
which reference it.  The <tt>mm_struct</tt> is the top-level structure used
to manage a process's virtual address space; it contains pointers to all of
the process's VMAs and page tables, along with various bits of locking and
housekeeping information.  If you have a pointer to a process's
<tt>mm_struct</tt> and a virtual address, you can quickly walk the page
tables and determine whether the given address is a reference to a specific
page. 
<p>

Most of the object-based reverse mapping has worked with the VMA
structure.  When performing reverse mapping of file-backed pages, use of
the VMA structure is unavoidable; if multiple processes have mapped the
file into their address spaces, each process likely has a different virtual
address for the same page.  The VMA structure contains the necessary
information to determine which virtual address each process will have for a
specific offset within a file.  Once that address is found, the page of
interest can be unmapped from that process's address space.

<p>
Anonymous pages are different from file-backed pages, however; they are
only shared between processes when a process forks (and, even then, it's a
copy-on-write sharing).  That means that, with one exception that we'll get
to, shared anonymous pages have the same virtual address in every process.
Thus, if you can track an anonymous page's virtual address and the
processes which share that page, you can quickly find all of the page table
entries referencing the page.
<p>

The anonmm patch takes advantage of this fact.  An anonymous page's virtual
address is stored in the <tt>index</tt> field of the <tt>page</tt>
structure.  This field is normally used to give a page's offset within the
file that backs it, but, since anonymous pages have no backing file, the
field is available for this use.  Hugh's patch then creates a new
<tt>anonmm</tt> structure which is used to create a linked list of
<tt>mm_struct</tt> structures; a pointer to  this list is 
also stored in the <tt>page</tt> structure.  The resulting data structure
looks roughly like this:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/anonmm.png" width=448 height=433 
 alt="[cheesy anonmm diagram]">
</center>
<p>
With this structure in place, the kernel can follow the pointers to quickly
find the page tables referencing a given anonymous page.  This approach, in
theory, should be a little simpler and faster than the anon_vma technique;
a process may have several VMAs for anonymous memory areas, but it will
never have more than one <tt>mm_struct</tt>.
<p>
There is one little problem with this whole scheme.  It depends on the fact
that every process has the same virtual address for a given, shared
anonymous page.  What happens when some wiseass process comes along and
moves a chunk of anonymous memory with <tt>mremap()</tt>?  At that point,
the memory has a new address, and the anonmm algorithm will be unable to
find it.  Hugh's solution for this problem is to simply copy the pages
being remapped.  They are copy-on-write pages, so making copies will not
create any correctness issues.  The copying could be expensive - it may
involve swapping in a number of pages so that they can be copied - but
remapping of anonymous memory should be a sufficiently rare operation that
a performance hit should not be a problem.
<p>
Which scheme is truly faster?  Martin Bligh has posted <a
href="/Articles/77140/">a set of benchmarks</a> showing that, while both
reverse mapping approaches are significantly faster than the mainline
kernel, neither is obviously faster than the other.  Andrea's work is
marginally ahead in more tests than Hugh's, but, overall, the two produce
roughly equivalent results.  So, if one of these implementations does find
its way into the 2.6 kernel, it will have to be chosen for reasons other
than performance.  Either that, or it will be some combination of the two;
Andrea and Hugh are actively discussing ideas, so that sort of combination
could happen.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This sounds really promising.<br>

The idea of having multiple level of age, instead of just active/inactive, does seem relatively simple.  Has this really not been tried before?  If it has not, I&#x27;m curious about why not...<br>

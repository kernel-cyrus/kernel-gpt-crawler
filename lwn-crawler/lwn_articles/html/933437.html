<h1>Supporting large block sizes</h1>

<p>
At the
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023">2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>, Luis Chamberlain led a plenary
session on kernel support for block sizes larger than 4KB.  There are
assumptions in the current kernel that the block size used by a block-layer
device is less than or equal to the system's page size—both are usually 4KB
today.  But there have been efforts over the years to remove that
restriction; that work may be heading toward fruition, in part because of
the folio efforts of late, though there are
still lots of areas that need attention.
</p>

<p>
Originally, storage devices used 512-byte blocks, but over time that has
grown to 4KB and beyond, Chamberlain said.  Supporting block sizes
greater than the page size has been desired for years; the first related
patches were <a href="/Articles/232757/">posted&nbsp;16 years ago</a> and the
topic comes up at every LSFMM, he said.
There is a <a
href="https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelProjects/large-block-size">wiki
page</a> about the project as well.
</p>

</a>

<p>
XFS has supported 64KB blocks for quite some time, but only on systems that
have 64KB pages; he believes some PowerPC-based systems were shipped with
XFS filesystems using 64KB blocks.  But the original goal of the long-ago
patch set is the 
same as today: to support 64KB blocks (and other power-of-two sizes) on
systems with 4KB pages.  To that end, he has added an experimental option
to his <a 
href="https://github.com/mcgrof/kdevops">kdevops</a> tool that will create NVMe
devices with larger block sizes.  You can format the devices and boot a
system, but if the devices are enabled, the system crashes.  Trying to
solve that problem is how he got involved in this work.

<p>
He has a <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mcgrof/linux-next.git/log/?h=large-block-next">Git
tree</a> for collecting patches of interest for the effort.  Beyond just
creating the large-block devices, he has also
added <a
href="https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops/blob/master/docs/lbs.md">ways
to test modified kernels in kdevops</a>.  Currently development and
testing is ongoing 
using XFS.
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain is tracking the effort using "objectives and key results"
(OKRs) in <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS7sQfw90S00l2rfOKm83Jlg0px8KxMQE4HHp_DKRGbAGcAV-xu6LITHBEc4xzVh9wLH6WM2lR0cZS8/pubhtml#">a
spreadsheet</a>; he is aware that some hate OKRs, but he is simply 
using them as a tracking tool for himself, though others are welcome to use
them as well.   In various parts of the talk, he displayed the OKR lists,
starting with the list for converting to the iomap support layer.
</p>

<p>
The previous session on <a href="/Articles/931809/">buffer-head
removal</a>, which was led by Hannes Reinecke,  did not really address the
block-device (bdev) cache, Chamberlain said.  The bdev cache is
important because some filesystems use it for metadata, and it uses buffer
heads.  As Reinecke said in that session, though, there may never come a
time when 
buffer heads will be fully removed from the kernel.
</p>

<p>
For filesystems that want to support large block sizes, the right path is
to use iomap, Chamberlain said.  It will take a while for iomap to be fully
ready to support block sizes larger than the page size, but there is a path
to get there, he believes.
The block layer itself still requires some work in order to support the
larger sizes, contrary to Matthew Wilcox's assertion that nothing more was
needed, Chamberlain said.  There is agreement now that only 0-order folios
will be allowed for buffer heads, which removes one of the entries from his
list. 
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o wanted to understand the business case for supporting these larger
block sizes; he went back to the <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/ZAJqjM6qLrraFrrn@bombadil.infradead.org/">email
proposing the LSFMM topic</a>, which seemed to indicate the push is coming
from the storage vendors.  He asked: what are the use cases where a 32KB or
64KB block size makes sense?   If he is to ask his company for time
to work on this support, he needs to be able to justify it and he felt that
part was left out of the discussion.
</p>

<p>
James Bottomley pointed out that Ts'o had mentioned 16KB database blocks in
his <a href="/Articles/932900/">session the previous day</a>, but Ts'o said
that the <a href="/Articles/933015/">atomic-write support</a> was a path to
being able to write 16KB blocks without tearing (i.e. partial writes).
Atomic writes can come in a reasonable time frame, and do not require
the large-block support, which is a more sprawling effort.  Reinecke said
that there was a simple answer to the objection from Ts'o: if he could not
justify working on large-block-size support, "then don't".
</p>

<p>
Reinecke said that supporting these larger blocks is something of an
experiment.  There is a belief that it will lead to better performance, but
the only way to find out is to try it.  Ts'o said that it seems like a huge
project, so he would need to be able to justify putting people to work on
it.  Josef Bacik said that the session was not aimed at making that
justification, rather it is trying to see what the status and plans are for
the project.  He suggested that the group move back on track.
</p>

<p>
There are a bunch of ancient filesystems in the kernel, Chamberlain said,
that are not going to be updated; some, such as ReiserFS, are already
slated for removal. There are others that might be removed, but supported
via FUSE.  He thinks that there are some old filesystems lacking
<tt>mkfs</tt> tools, which makes them hard to test, thus hard to support.
He thought it would be good to put together a plan for what to do with
various old, likely unmaintained, filesystems.
</p>

<p>
Supporting folios larger than order-0 (single page) in filesystems is
needed, he said, but there are questions about what needs to be done for memory
compaction.  Wilcox said that the memory compaction code has not yet been
converted from pages to folios, so that needs to happen.  There is also a
need to be able to migrate larger folios (not order-0) from one zone to
another to try to ensure that higher-order allocations will not fail.  Once
the conversion to folios happens, he or someone else can dig more into the
migration issue. 
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain said that he has been working with Dave Chinner on rebasing
Chinner's older patch set that <a
href="/ml/linux-fsdevel/20181107063127.3902-1-david@fromorbit.com/">added
support for block sizes larger than the page size for XFS</a>; the needed
changes now just boil down to two patches.  Testing is
ongoing to ensure that those patches have not broken anything.   Once that
has been established, the next step would be to test XFS on a real device with a
larger block size.
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain wondered if other filesystems were interested in supporting
larger block 
sizes.  Bacik said that Btrfs already handles metadata in 16KB blocks, so
he would like to make that work on larger-block devices.  He would love to
do it for data too, but work on that will not happen until after the iomap
conversion for Btrfs data is done.
</p>

<p>
Bottomley said that Chinner's original patch set was much larger than two
patches, so he wondered whether that was due to the folio conversion that
had already gone into XFS.  If so, what looks like a huge amount of work
for supporting large block sizes may turn out to be relatively
straightforward.  Chamberlain confirmed that; for filesystems that want to
support larger block sizes, it is much easier once the folio conversion has
been done.
</p>

<p>
Handling metadata for those filesystems that are still using buffer heads
may still be an issue, however.  From afar, Darrick Wong noted that XFS has
its own buffer cache internally, so its metadata handling can already use block
sizes larger than the page size—"at least until memory fragmentation kills
you".  The part that does not work right now is that iomap is lacking
a way to tell the memory-management subsystem that XFS needs multi-page
folios that are at least of a 
certain size.
</p>

<p>
After some discussion of memory fragmentation issues, Wong suggested that
someone should simply set up a modified XFS using 8KB blocks (and 4KB
pages) in order to run MySQL on a system without much memory.  The idea
would be to see if it falls over any faster than a regular XFS with 4KB
blocks.  Chamberlain said that the issue of how to test these changes is
one that needs to addressed; a test plan with specifics about how to
measure the impacts (good or bad) of the changes is needed.

           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 21, 2012</br>
           </div>
In the beginning there was <tt>printk()</tt> - literally: the 0.01 kernel
release included 44 <tt>printk()</tt> calls.  Since then, <tt>printk()</tt>
has picked up details like logging levels and a lot of new formatting
operators; it has also expanded to tens of thousands of call sites throughout
the kernel.  Developers often reach for it as the first way to figure out
what is going on inside a misbehaving subsystem.  If some developers have
their way, though, <tt>printk()</tt> calls will become an endangered
species.  But not everybody has signed on to that goal.
<p>
There are certainly plenty of ways in which <tt>printk()</tt> could be
improved.  It imposes no standardization on messages, either across a
subsystem or over time.  As a result, messages can be hard for programs
(or people) to parse, and they can change in trivial but obnoxious ways
from one kernel release to the next.  The actual calls, starting with text
like:
<p>
<pre>
    printk(KERN_ERR ...
</pre>
<p>
are relatively verbose; among other things, that often causes
<tt>printk()</tt> statements to run afoul of the 80-column line width
restriction.  Messages printed with <tt>printk()</tt> may also lack
important information needed to determine what the kernel is really trying
to say.
<p>
Various attempts have been made to improve on <tt>printk()</tt> over the
years.  Arguably the most successful of those is the set of functions
defined for device drivers:
<p>
<pre>
    int dev_dbg(struct device *dev, const char *format, ...);
    int dev_info(struct device *dev, const char *format, ...);
    int dev_notice(struct device *dev, const char *format, ...);
    /* ... */
    int dev_emerg(struct device *dev, const char *format, ...);
</pre>
<p>
These functions, by embedding the logging level in the name itself, are
more concise than the <tt>printk()</tt> calls they replace.  They also
print the name of the relevant device in standard form, ensuring that it's
always possible to associate a message with the device that generated it.
Use of these functions is not universal in device drivers, but it is
widespread and uncontroversial.
<p>
There is a rather lower level of consensus surrounding a different set of
functions (macros, really) that look like this:
<p>
<pre>
    int pr_info(const char *format, ...);
    /* ... */
    int pr_emerg(const char *format, ...);
</pre>
<p>
These functions, too, encode the logging level in the function name, making
things more concise.  They also attempt to at least minimally standardize
the format of logging by passing the <tt>format</tt> string through a macro
called <tt>pr_fmt()</tt>.  That leads to a line like this appearing in
several hundred source files in the kernel: 
<p>
<pre>
    #define pr_fmt(fmt) KBUILD_MODNAME ": " fmt
</pre>
<p>
Due to the way
the macro works, this line must appear before the <tt>#include</tt> block
that would otherwise be at the beginning of the file.  Defining
<tt>pr_fmt()</tt> in this way causes all strings printed from the file to
have the module name prepended; many subsystems use a literal string rather
than the module name, but the intent is the same.
<p>

The spread of <tt>pr_*()</tt> through the kernel is mainly the result of an
ongoing campaign by Joe Perches - notable for having just merged <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/475be4d85a274d0961593db41cf85689db1d583c">a
100,000-line whitespace-only ISDN subsystem cleanup patch</a> for 3.4 - who
has converted thousands of 
<tt>printk()</tt> calls over the years.  To some developers, these changes
are a welcome cleaning-up of the code; to others, they represent pointless
code churn.  The discussion has been quiet for a while, but it recently
came back when Joe <a href="/Articles/487447/">tried to convert the ext4
filesystem</a>; ext4 maintainer Ted Ts'o <a
href="/Articles/487449/">rejected</a> the conversion, saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Changing printk's to pr_info and pr_cont is patch noise as far as
	I'm concerned.  Adds no value, and just breaks other patches
</div>
<p>
David Miller <a
href="https://plus.google.com/101384639386588513837/posts/KaRo6LaVCx5">commented</a>
on this decision in a rather unsympathetic fashion:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Some kernel maintainers are real blockheads about code
	cleanups. And being like that doesn't make you look established and
	sophisticated, instead it makes you look like what you actually
	are, a relic.
</div>
<p>
Ted probably does not feel like a relic, and he is probably not trying to
be sophisticated; he is almost certainly trying to maintain code he is
responsible for in the best way he can.  In his view, changing a bunch of
code from one print function to another - possibly introducing a lot of
patch conflicts on the way - does not help in that regard.  Beyond that, he
<a href="/Articles/487452/">said</a>, the standardization introduced by
these functions is nowhere near enough to solve the structured logging
problem, meaning that, someday, all those calls will have to be changed yet
another time when a proper solution is available. 
<p>
Proponents of the change argue that some structure is better than none, and
that the new functions offer some useful flexibility when the time to add
more structure comes.  They claim that the overall size of the kernel is
reduced (slightly) due to better sharing of strings.  Messages printed with
<tt>pr_debug()</tt> can be enabled and disabled with the <a
href="/Articles/434833/">dynamic debugging interface</a>, while straight
<tt>printk()</tt> calls cannot.  And, perhaps most of all, they argue that
consistency across the code base has value - though that argument was heard
rather less when the <tt>pr_*()</tt> interface was new and relatively
unused.
<p>
Needless to say, this is not the kind of discussion that comes to any sort
of definitive conclusion.  With regard to ext4, the conversion will
probably not take place anytime soon; that is Ted's turf, and it is
unlikely that anybody can summon arguments strong enough to convince Linus
to override him.  Elsewhere in the kernel, though, these conversions will
certainly continue.  As will, undoubtedly, the associated flame wars.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I think it's worth mentioning here that printk(KERN_DEBUG ...) statements are always enabled while when using pr_dbg() one gets <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/434833/">dynamic debug</a> support for free.

Jon is going though the entire tree and making the changes, but the changes then get sent to the appropriate maintainer to be accepted. When he got around to the ext* tree, Ted gave an emphatic NAK to the pf_info() patches, while accepting and expressing appreciation for some of the other patches Jon provided.<br>

      <P>I can kinda see the bind something like ext4 is in, since the change smacks a little of a "flag day" for "how ext4 prints messages from the kernel".  Any bugfix or stability patch made to ext4 after the <TT>printk</TT>-&gt;<TT>pr_XXX</TT> change will be that much harder to backport those changes to a kernel that existed before that "flag day".</P>
<P>That said, once the<TT> pr_XXX </TT>functions have been in release kernels long enough that the oldest relevant 'stable' release has them (what's that, about a year? year and a half?), then it seems like you can incrementally start folding the<TT> pr_XXX </TT>changes in, file by file.  Then a backport will convert some fraction of<TT> printk </TT>calls relatively painlessly, it seems.  Either that, or you could execute a much less exciting 'flag day' patch on ext4 to convert<TT> printk </TT>to the newer forms, and make it a prereq for any further bugfixes/improvements.  Because all the relevant back-port targets will have<TT> pr_XXX</TT>, at least it'll be mostly painless.
</P>
<P>Right now, though, am I wrong in thinking that the<TT> printk</TT>-&gt;<TT>pr_XXX </TT>changes make it just that bit more difficult to migrate patches to older, pre-change kernels, as long as the patch overlaps one of these conversions?</P>

"Due to the way the macro works, this line must appear before the #include block that would otherwise be at the beginning of the file. Defining pr_fmt() in this way causes all strings printed from the file to have the module name prepended; many subsystems use a literal string rather than the module name, but the intent is the same."<br>

#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;<br>

#define pr_fmt(fmt)	KBUILD_MODNAME " -&gt; %s:%d -&gt; " fmt,__func__,__LINE__<br>

This works for me in the LKM that I am writing while following a course. I could be mistaken on my interpretation of what was said, though.<br>

This aside, I do appreciate the rest of the piece!<br>

      Bear in mind that you're responding to an article that was written over eight years ago.  A lot can change in eight years of kernel development!

True!<br>
<p>
It also seems that while this is does technically work, it does give a small warning about overwriting a previously defined pr_fmt.<br>

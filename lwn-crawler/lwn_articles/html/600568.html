<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>May 29, 2014</br>
           </div>
The Linux audit subsystem is not one of the best-loved parts of the
kernel.  It allows the creation of a log stream documenting specific system
events â€” system calls, modifications to specific files, actions by
processes with certain user IDs, etc.  For some, it is an ideal way to get
a handle on what is being done on the system and, in particular, to satisfy
various requirements for security certifications (Common Criteria, for
example).  For others, it is an ugly and invasive addition to the kernel
that adds maintenance and runtime overhead without adding useful
functionality.  More recently, though, it seems that audit adds some
security holes of its own.  But the real problem, perhaps, is that almost
nobody actually looks at this code, so bugs can lurk for a long time.
<p>
The system call auditing mechanism creates audit log entries in response to
system calls; the system administrator can load rules specifying which
system calls are to be logged.  These rules can include various tests on
system call parameters, but there is also a simple bitmask, indexed by
system call number, specifying which calls might be of interest.  One of
the first things done by the audit code is to check the appropriate bit for
the current system call to see if it is set; if it is not, there is no
auditing work to be done.
<p>
Philipp Kern recently <a href="/Articles/600573/">noticed a little
problem</a> with how that code works with the x32 ABI.  When code running
under that ABI invokes a system call, it does not use the normal system
call numbers defined by the x86 architecture; instead, x32 system calls
(which require compatibility handling for some parameters) are
marked by setting an additional bit (0x40000000) in that number.  The audit
code fails to remove that bit before checking the system call number in
its bitmask; as one might imagine, the results are not as one might wish.
Philipp included a patch to strip out the x32 bit, but it turns out that
the problem is a bit bigger than that.
<p>
Andy Lutomirski, in looking at Philipp's patch, realized that the code
wasn't just failing to strip out one bit; there are, in fact, no bounds
checks on the system call number at all.  User space can pass in any system
call number it wants, and the kernel will use that number to index into its
bitmask array; the result for a sufficiently large system call number is a
predictable kernel oops.  Andy also <a
href="/Articles/600575/">suggested</a> that this failure could be used to
determine the value of specific bits in kernel space, leading to an
information-disclosure vulnerability.
<p>
Andy submitted <a href="/Articles/600577/">a patch</a> to fix this
particular problem, but he didn't stop there.  He has come to the
conclusion that the audit subsystem is beyond repair, so his patch marks
the whole thing as being broken, making it generally inaccessible.  He
cited a number of problems beyond this security issue: it hurts performance
even when it is not being used, it is not (in his mind) reliable, it has
problems with various architectures, and "<q>its approach to freeing
memory is terrifying</q>".  All told, Andy <a
href="/Articles/600578/">said</a>, we're better off without it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	In summary, the code is a giant mess.  The way it works is nearly
	incomprehensible.  It contains at least one severe bug.  I'd love
	to see it fixed, but for now, distributions seem to think that
	enabling CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL is a reasonable thing to do, and I'd
	argue that it's actually a terrible choice for anyone who doesn't
	actually need syscall audit rules.  And I don't know who needs
	these things.
</div>
<p>
It is unsurprising that Eric Paris, who maintains the audit code, <a
href="/Articles/600594/">disagrees</a> with this assessment.  His point of
view is that this is just another bug in need of fixing; it does not
indicate any systemic problem with the audit code.
<p>
It is telling, though, that this particular vulnerability has existed in
the audit subsystem almost since its inception.
The audit code receives little in the way of review; most kernel developers
simply turn it off for their own kernels and look the other way.  But this
subsystem is just the sort of thing that distributors are almost required
to enable in their kernels; some users will want it, so they have to turn
it on for everybody.  As a result, almost all systems out there have audit
enabled (look for a running <tt>kauditd</tt> thread), even though  few
of them are using it.  These systems take a performance penalty just for
having audit enabled, and they are vulnerable to any issues that may be
found in the audit code.
<p>
If audit were to be implemented today, the developer involved would have to
give some serious thought, at least, to using the tracing mechanism.  It
already has hooks applied in all of the right places, but those hooks have
(almost) zero overhead when they are not enabled.  Tracing has its own
filtering mechanism built in; the addition of <a
href="/Articles/599755/">BPF-based filters</a> will make that feature more
capable and faster as well.  In a sense, the audit subsystem contains yet
another kernel-based virtual machine that makes decisions about which
events to log; using the tracing infrastructure would allow the removal of
that code and a consolidation to a single virtual machine that is more
widely maintained and reviewed.
<p>
The audit system we have, though, predates the tracing subsystem, so it
could not have been based on tracing.  Replacing it without breaking users
would not be a trivial job, even in the absence of snags that have been
glossed over in the above paragraph (and such snags certainly exist).  So
we are likely stuck with the current audit subsystem (which will certainly
not be marked "broken" in the mainline kernel) for the foreseeable future.
Hopefully it will receive some auditing of its own just in case there are
more old surprises lurking therein.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
I'm not an expert on the kaudit subsystem (in fact, I just learned of it), but it looks like kauditd is only spawned in response to a user-space request for it (e.g. from SELinux auditd). See kernel/audit.c:<br>
<p>
static int audit_receive_msg(struct sk_buff *skb, struct nlmsghdr *nlh)<br>
{<br>
[...]<br>
	/* As soon as there's any sign of userspace auditd,<br>
	 * start kauditd to talk to it */<br>
	if (!kauditd_task) {<br>
		kauditd_task = kthread_run(kauditd_thread, NULL, "kauditd");<br>
[...]<br>
}<br>
<p>
So it looks like my Ubuntu system doesn't have any overhead from kauditd; just the overhead of listening (likely low?).<br>
<p>
Now, I don't know what other kinds of overhead CONFIG_AUDIT* might have besides kauditd, but I am at least doubtful of these claims now.<br>

      According to the posting by Andy, the effect of CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALLS is

<font class="QuotedText">
<pre>
It forces all syscalls into the slow path and it can do crazy things
like building audit contexts just in case actual handling of the
syscall triggers an audit condition so that the exit path can log the
syscall.  That's way worse than a single branch.

Try it: benchmark getpid on Fedora and then repeat the experiment with
syscall auditing fully disabled.  The difference is striking.

Right, I wasn't really objecting to the statement that the audit subsystem causes syscall overhead by default (I haven't run enough tests to confirm/deny). I was just objecting to the wording of this article; it points users to the 'kauditd' kernel thread, which AFAICT does not necessarily run by default. This is potentially misleading.<br>

Try running your favorite syscall-heavy workload and seeing if __audit_syscall_xyz shows up.<br>
<p>
To be clear: I don't really object to CONFIG_AUDIT -- it's just CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL.  Once audit has been enabled, you're stuck with syscall auditing overhead until the next reboot.  There's a workaround:<br>
<p>
# auditctl -a task,never<br>

I'm currently lobbying for Fedora to turn off syscall auditing in their default configuration:<br>

Wow.  That's hideous.<br>
<p>
I have no clue what loginuid and sessionid (which appears to be completely unrelated to the POSIX session id) have to do with syscall auditing.  It would be easy to split that out from CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL, since it seems to be almost completely unrelated to syscall auditing, other than the fact that syscall auditing logs the loginuid and sessionid.<br>

Systemd requires it too (or at least gentoo's systemd ebuild checks for it and warns if the thing isn't enabled), probably for exactly the same thing consolekit uses it for, if not more.<br>
<p>
But no sign of kauditd.  I might just try disabling CONFIG_AUDIT or at least CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL next time I do a kernel build and see if systemd can run properly with it disabled.  I've wondered why I actually needed it ever since I first enabled it.  At least that way if I have to actually reenable it, I'll know exactly what I was unbreaking by doing so.<br>

Well, whatever systemd "requires" CONFIG_AUDIT for, doesn't seem to affect me turning it off.  I rebuild without it, rebooted, logged in, started X... launched a terminal window and zgrepped /proc/config.gz for CONFIG_AUDIT to verify I hadn't somehow booted the old kernel...  Loaded up firefox and LWN again to write this update...<br>
<p>
Still don't know what systemd "requires" it for, but it's off now and doesn't seem to hurt me, so... I'm leaving it off.<br>

It's funny because systemd's README explicitly instructs users who want to run systemd inside a container to disable the audit subsystem.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; If audit were to be implemented today, the developer involved would have to give some serious thought, at least, to using the tracing mechanism.</font><br>
<p>
wouldn't it be "kind of straightforward" to rip out the current audit subsystem and replace it with a compatibility layer that translates everything which it exposes to userspace to the tracing subsystem?<br>

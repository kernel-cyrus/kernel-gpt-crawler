           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 13, 2018</br>
           </div>
Hundreds (at least) of kernel bugs are fixed every month.  Given the
kernel's privileged position within the system, a relatively large portion
of those bugs have security implications.  Many bugs are relatively easily
noticed once they are triggered; that leads to them being fixed.  Some
bugs, though, can be hard to detect, a result that can be worsened by the
design of in-kernel APIs.  A proposed change to how user-space accessors
work will, hopefully, help to shine a light on one class of stealthy bugs.
<p>
Many system calls involve addresses passed from user space into the kernel;
the kernel is then expected to read from or write to those addresses.  As
long as the calling process can legitimately access the addressed memory,
all is well.  Should user space pass an address pointing to data it should
not be able to access — a pointer into kernel space, for example — bad
things can happen.
<p>
The kernel protects itself against erroneous (or malicious) addresses from
user space via a two-step mechanism.  The first of these is the
<tt>access_ok()</tt> macro:
<p>
<pre>
    int access_ok(type, address, size);
</pre>
<p>
This function will return a nonzero value if an access 
of the given <tt>type</tt> (<tt>VERIFY_READ</tt> or <tt>VERIFY_WRITE</tt>)
to <tt>size</tt> bytes of memory at <tt>address</tt>  makes sense — is that
region of memory in a part of the address range that user space should be
accessing?  On most architectures, its job is to filter out attempts to
access memory that is in kernel space.  If <tt>access_ok()</tt> returns
zero, no attempt to dereference the given address should be made.
Otherwise, once that test is passed, the second step is to use one of any
of a number of primitives to actually copy memory between user and
kernel space, using normal memory protections to prevent unauthorized
access.

<p>
While most of the interfaces provided inside the kernel for access to
user-space memory combine those steps, there are some that deliberately
separate them, usually as a way to optimize several accesses happening in a
row.  When those interfaces are used, it is possible for the developer to
forget to call <tt>access_ok()</tt> in one or more paths, leading to a
situation where the kernel will access kernel-space memory using an address
controlled by user space — never a good idea.  That results in vulnerabilities
like <a href="/Articles/736348/">CVE-2017-5123</a> or the recent <a
href="/Articles/760345/">bsg problems</a>.
<p>
Many problems that cause the kernel to try to dereference a wild pointer
can be flushed out by fuzzing.  But, when the kernel's user-space access
functions are asked to copy data to or from the wrong place, they simply
return an <tt>EFAULT</tt> status that is silently passed back to the
user-space caller.  Most of the time, that is the right thing to do, since the most
likely explanation is a bug in the user-space program.  It may have asked
to copy data from a portion of its address space that isn't mapped, for
example, or to write to some read-only memory.
<p>
The same thing happens, though, if user space asks the kernel to copy data
to or from a random kernel-space address.  Normally, the
<tt>access_ok()</tt> call will catch the problem and no attempt to copy is
made.  But if <tt>access_ok()</tt> isn't called, the kernel may attempt to
access kernel space on behalf of the user.  In the absence of a focused
attack, a random kernel-space address has a high probability of pointing to
memory with no mapping at all, on a 64-bit system at least.  The resulting
page fault gets turned into an <tt>EFAULT</tt> return that is
indistinguishable from any other error.
<p>
If somebody is running a fuzzing program in user space, this
<tt>EFAULT</tt> return will completely mask the fact that the kernel just
tried to do something bad.  So developers will remain unaware of the
existence of the bug which, consequentially, will not be fixed.  Eventually
somebody else will discover it; that somebody may not have any interest in
seeing the hole closed.
<p>
This outcome is unfortunate because the kernel has all of the information
it needs to know that a potentially severe security bug exists.  With just
a tiny number of exceptions, the user-space access functions will never be
called with a pointer into kernel space.  So if one of those functions
generates a kernel-space page fault, something has gone wrong somewhere.
It would make sense to try to draw attention to the problem so it can be
investigated and fixed.
<p>
That is the conclusion reached by Jann Horn, resulting in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20180807012257.20157-1-jannh@google.com/">this patch
set</a> for the x86 architecture.  The objective is simple: if a user-space
access function faults with a kernel-space address, and the call site has
not been specially marked, a <tt>WARN()</tt> call will result.  That will
create a kernel oops and a traceback in the kernel log.  That should
attract attention in many settings, but it is especially likely to when
fuzzers are being run, since they are on the lookout for just that kind of
result.
<p>
The reaction to the patch set was uniformly positive; there were requests
for various improvements, of course, but everybody seems to want to see
this work proceed.
<p>
Kernel developers tend to be careful not to send too much information to
the system log.  At best, excessive chattiness can make it hard to see the
messages that are actually important; at worst, it can be exploited by the
user to overflow the log or as a general denial-of-service attack.  But the
kernel, as it is now, is masking some important information about severe
bugs that it should be able to detect.  That silence should soon come to an
end; sometimes making a little noise is exactly the right thing to do.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

System calls return error codes upon failure, EFAULT  is the appropriate code in the vast majority of cases where a bad address is passed.<br>
<p>
SIGSEGV is usually produced by synchronous faults (bad memory accesses) within userspace code.<br>

Ah... so sending SIGSEGV would be doing the wrong thing (maybe for the right reason) where oopsing would be a good compromise for the right reason. (And if you're really paranoid, you can panic on oops.)<br>

      Yes, that's the way it is handled up to now.  It still seems to me that a SIGSEGV would be a better behaviour: It is less likely to be ignored by accident, and it allows reporting additional information through the siginfo_t * parameter of the signal handler.  Of course, there is also the requirement not to break existing code, so the kernel cannot switch to reporting bad accesses through SIGSEGV across the board.

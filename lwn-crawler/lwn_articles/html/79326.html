One of the patches in Andrew Morton's "merge candidate" tree is the
lightweight audit framework.  This patch, written by Rik Faith, is intended
to be a way for the kernel to get various types of audit information out to
user space without slowing things down, especially when auditing is not
being used.  The framework is meant to serve as a complement to SELinux; it
is already being shipped as a part of the Fedora Core&nbsp;2 test&nbsp;2
kernel.
<p>
There are two kernel-side components to the audit code.  The first is a
generic mechanism for creating audit records and communicating with user
space.  All of that communication is performed via netlink sockets; there
are no new system calls added as part of the audit framework.  Essentially,
a user-space process creates a <tt>NETLINK_AUDIT</tt> socket, writes
<tt>audit_request</tt> structures it, and reads back <tt>audit_reply</tt>
structures in return.  
<p>
The generic part of the audit mechanism can control whether auditing is
enabled at all, perform rate limiting of messages, and handle a few other
tasks.  On the kernel side, it provides a <tt>printk()</tt>-like mechanism
for sending messages to user space.  This code also implements a
user-specified policy on what happens if memory is not available for
auditing; truly paranoid administrators can request that the kernel panic
in such situations.
<p>
The audit patch includes some SELinux tweaks to make it use the audit
functions rather than <tt>printk()</tt> when it has something to log.  
<p>
The audit logging code expects an audit daemon to be running to accept
messages via the netlink socket.  Code for an example daemon is available
<a href="http://people.redhat.com/faith/audit/">in Rik's Red Hat web
area</a>.  Should there be no daemon running, log messages are simply
passed to <tt>printk()</tt> instead.
<p>
In addition to the generic support code, the audit patch includes a
mechanism for auditing system calls.  One gets the sense that this was the
real purpose for the patch.  System call auditing is off by default, but a
suitably privileged user-space process can turn it on and load a whole set
of rules describing what should be logged.  Rules can test on various
attributes of the calling process, including its process ID, user and group
ID (both "real" and "effective"), etc.  Rules can also be set to fire on
accesses to particular devices or files.  Finally, there are also tests on
specific system call arguments, whether the call succeeds, or for a
specific return value.
<p>
Included with the audit daemon is an <tt>auditctl</tt> utility which can be
used for setting and tweaking rules.
<p>
The audit mechanism will give system administrators a new tool for looking
at what is going on between user space and the kernel.  With the addition
of some user-space utilities, it could become a powerful facility for
tracking down system problems and security issues - or for any number of
big-brotherish applications.  Expect to see it in 2.6.6.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <a href="http://www.intersectalliance.com/">Intersect Alliance</a> has been working on <a href="http://snare.sourceforge.net/">Snare</a> for quite some time, now.  I know the Snare team have been talking recently with Rik Faith about how to rationalize the auditing mechanism in the kernel so that it can be used to support a highly structured audit/logging mechanism like Snare, in addition to the simple tools provided with Fedora Core 2.

      Whats the diff. from this - and the feature systrace supports for doing exactly  this(when recording a profile)? I'm guessing theres a good reason he reinvented the wheel, instead of just using the systrace code for this (he could leave out the allow/disallow parts if he didn't want them) ? <p>Anyways, just curious - systrace seems like a good idea, and just wondering why he didn't just use its code for the audit part. <br>There could be a ton of valid reasons ofcourse - just wanted to &quot;throw in&quot; the question that comes to mind.. hoping the vanilla 2.6 kernel will shape up to be a bit more capable security-wise, than vanilla-2.4 is :)  (thinking of projects such as LIDS, SELinux (already in via the new cool security-modules feature), systrace, vserver etc.). Unfortunately a project like vserver can't be implemented as a security-module only AFAIK, and perhaps the same goes for systrace?<p>Why not just patch the stuff in yourself, you might think? Well the problems I found with this, was that some patches I used, were very much incompatible - and my limited knowledge of kernel-code could not figure out how to merge them together - ie. I had to choose what features I wanted to use, out of the ones I would have liked to have :( <p>I must say the 2.6 is already shaping up very well, as IPv6 and IPSEC is looking good - and as it is now in the kernel (the USAGE version) it won't give me any problems anymore :)<p>Enough rambling.. its late and I'm just thinking aloud - ignore me if you will :)

      I think the major differences are: systrace is a reference monitor, it can<br>return a code telling the kernel to allow, (optionally allowing with a specific set of UID/GID credentials!), or deny the access (optionally with a specific errno).  However, it only acts on system calls (though it provides canonicalized arguments to the reference monitor in user space; on which the daemon can make its decisions).<p>This &quot;auditing framework&quot; is clearly targeted toward logging and is more pervasive, extending beyond system calls to other sorts of resources, and having the rate limiting features.<p>Personally I prefer the systrace approach and would like to see it more widely adopted.  SELinux is far too complex and intrusive.  However, with the implicit primatur of the NSA giving Red Hat Inc. the lust to include it for future appeal to Gov. and Banking institutions I think that the simpler, more elegant, and (dare I say) equally effective systrace approach will languish in obscurity! :(<p>JimD

      You can get a readme and kernel patches from the "wayback machine" at archive.org, though they don't have the user space code (auditd-0.4.tar.gz) cached there.  I would be interested in finding that myself.<br>

Adhering to log auditing standards is important, and it becomes more difficult as more and more nodes of varying OSs have to be added to the system. One free (and open source) solution to this problem is NXLog, a highly scalable high-performance log management software available for Windows, Unix, Linux, BSD, Android and other operating systems. More information is available at the link below:<br>

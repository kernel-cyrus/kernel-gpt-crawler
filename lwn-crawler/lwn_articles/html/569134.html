The <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/renameat.2.html"><tt>renameat()</tt>
system call</a> changes the name of the file given as an 
argument, possibly replacing an existing file in the process.  This
operation is atomic; the view of the filesystem from user space will
reflect the situation before or after the <tt>renameat()</tt> call, but it
will never expose an intermediate state.  Things work well when one file is
involved, but what happens when multiple rename operations need to be run
as a single atomic operation?  That is a big problem, but, thanks to a
patch from Miklos Szeredi, we might have a solution to a smaller subset.
<p>
The problem Miklos is trying to solve is the problem of exchanging two
files â€” both files continue to exist, but their names have been swapped.
To achieve this, he has posted <a href="/Articles/569028/">a patch set</a>
adding a new <tt>renameat2()</tt> system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int renameat2(int olddir, const char *oldname, 
		  int newdir, const char *newname, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
This system call differs from <tt>renameat()</tt> in that it has the new
<tt>flags</tt> argument; if <tt>flags</tt> is zero, <tt>renameat2()</tt>
behaves exactly as <tt>renameat()</tt>.

If, instead, <tt>flags</tt> contains <tt>RENAME_EXCHANGE</tt>, an existing
file at <tt>newname</tt> will not be deleted; instead, it will be renamed
to <tt>oldname</tt>.  Thus, with this flag, <tt>renameat2()</tt> can be
used to atomically exchange two files.  The main use case for
<tt>renameat2()</tt> is to support union filesystems, where it is often
desirable to atomically replace files or directories with "whiteouts"
indicating that they have been deleted.  One could imagine other
possibilities as well; Miklos suggests atomically replacing a directory
with a symbolic link as one of them.

Yes.  The number is just a sequential number indicating a newer system call with a similar name and semantics to the old one.<br>
<p>
This has been going on for a very long time, eg: dup &amp; dup2 (dup2, I am told, first appeared in Unix v7 so that would be 1979).<br>

      Well, <code>dup</code> has one argument, <code>dup2</code> has two and <code>dup3</code> has three thus I've always thought about this number as about number of arguments.

It certainly indicates number of arguments in wait3() and wait4() (note that there is no wait2()).<br>
<p>
i.e., this was a kludge workaround for C not supporting C++ function overloading, not a way for people to not bother to think up good names for their syscalls. (That way like Microsoft's OpenEx2() horrors.)<br>
<p>
(I started writing a comment much like the original one, but it seemed uncharitable because I couldn't think of a better name myself. renameat_with_flags(), bleah, no. frenameat(), no. renameat+(), not a valid C identifier and people would shoot me and they'd be right.)<br>

it all depends on the person who named the function.<br>
<p>
some people use the number to indicate the number of parameters, some people use it as a generation number<br>
<p>
I suspect some of it is just the personality of the people involved, but that some of it may also be how much they expect the new version to completely replace the old version (as opposed to both versions being used for writing new software)<br>

      I think the reason you can't think of a better name for renameat2 is that it does two barely related things.  This would be an abuse of C++ function overloading if that were an option.
<P>
I think the proper naming would be to keep renameat for renaming and add exchangeat for exchanging.

Actually the new call is not just about exchanging :<br>
<p>
0 - same as renameat() behaviour<br>
RENAME_NOREPLACE - avoids overwriting<br>
RENAME_EXCHANGE  - atomic exchange<br>
<p>
So it's a modal renameat(2).<br>

      AFAICS mv(1) does not have any options which can actually be used for this behavior. Perhaps they could be added in the future, but as it is now it just changes the name of file, it can not swap two filenames!

I'd actually rather that mv(1) *not* gain an option for this. It seems something more fitting for a swap(1) (or similar) tool instead. Related, I have a little tool I use locally called 'relocate' which takes a tree and does mv(1) on the contents, but recurses into directories when the target directory already exists (it's main use is merging in new music files into the existing "archive" tree without using rsync to do a smarter cp(1) and wasting time).<br>

It may be useful for saving documents while retaining a back-up copy of the originalâ€”right now, one has to muck about with hard links if atomicity is desired.<br>
<p>
It's almost like the old MacOS function FspExchangeFiles, except that the latter only swapped the data, not the file identities or metadata. Keeping the creation date, permissions and so on is quite useful, but clearly not what renameat2 is about.<br>
<p>
I'm curious to know what happens if two processes try to swap the same files simultaneously. Will they both fail (nothing happens), both succeed (same), or one succeed (accomplishing the task for either, but arbitrarily signalling a failure to one of them)?<br>

As I understand it (I could easily be wrong), filesystem access is sequential, so even if two threads executed the syscall at the same time, one would end up with the lock first, so they'd both succeed at the swap.<br>

      <P>
If they were both doing<TT> swap(a, b) </TT>then yes I'd expect the outcome to be a double-swap, leaving a and b in their original state.  A perhaps more interesting thought experiment is if one process tries to do<TT> swap(a, b) </TT>in a race with another process trying to do<TT> swap(a, c)</TT>.  You get two possible outcomes:
</P>
<PRE>
   // swap(a,b) happens before swap(a,c).  a', b', and c' are the new files
   a' = c
   b' = a
   c' = b
</PRE>
<P> and </P>
<PRE>
   // swap(a,c) happens before swap(a,b).  a', b', and c' are the new files
   a' = b
   b' = c
   c' = a
</PRE>
<P>I can't immediately think of why this might be useful, but it could certainly lead to some head scratching.</P>

Something like this may also be useful for Wine to emulate junctions points, which basically redirect one directory to another on the local filesystem. So you would exchange a directory with a symlink to another directory.<br>
<p>
A complication is that the original directory must be empty, and checking that with a separate call reintroduces a race condition. So renameat2 would need to gain a flag saying that it must fail if oldname is a non-emtpy directory.<br>

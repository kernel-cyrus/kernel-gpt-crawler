<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>June 14, 2020</br>
           </div>
By the time Linus Torvalds <a href="/Articles/823019/">released 5.8-rc1</a>
and closed the merge 
window for this development cycle, 14,206 non-merge changesets had
been pulled into the repository for&nbsp;5.8.  That is more work than
was pulled for the entire 5.7 cycle; clearly development work on the kernel
has not (yet) slowed 
down in response to events in the wider world.  The nearly 6,700 changes
pulled since <a href="/Articles/822077/">the previous summary</a> include
huge numbers of fixes and internal cleanups, but there were a number of
significant features added as well.
<p>

<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The RISC-V architecture has gained support for the KGDB kernel
     debugger.

</ul>


<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem now properly supports multiple private
     instances, each with independent mount options.
<li> The kernel will now refuse loadable modules if any sections in the
     module executable have both the write and execution bits set.  This is
     part of a larger effort to ensure that no kernel memory is both
     writable and executable.
<li> After a couple of years of work, the <a
     href="/Articles/760714/">generalized kernel event-notification
     mechanism</a> has been merged.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6c3297841472">this commit</a> for
     an overview and <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c73be61cede5">this commit</a> for
     documentation on the new subsystem.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The device mapper has a new "emulate block size" target that can
     be used to cause a block device to appear to have a block size smaller
     than what the hardware supports.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d3c7b35c20d6">This commit</a> has
     documentation. 
<li> The "zoned" target for the device mapper has gained the ability to
     pair regular block devices with the zoned variety; the result should
     be an aggregate with higher performance than the zoned device alone.
<li> The F2FS filesystem has added support for LZO-RLE compression.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>Clock</b>:
     Renesas r8a7742 clock pulse generators,
     Qualcomm MSM8939 global clock controllers,
     Intel Lightning Mountain clock controllers,
     Ingenic X1830 clock generators,
     MediaTek MT6765 clocks, and
     Baikal-T1 clock control units.
<li> <b>GPIO and pin control</b>:
     The "GPIO aggregator" driver can collect a set of unrelated GPIO lines
     into a virtual GPIO chip, allowing them to be exposed to user space as
     a unit (and, in particular, allowing permissions in <tt>/dev</tt> to
     be used to
     control access to those lines).  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ce7a2f77f976">this documentation
     commit</a> for details.  Also:
     NXP i.MX8DXL pin controllers,
     Qualcomm SM8250 pin controllers, and
     Intel Jasper Lake pin controllers.

     Analog Devices Generic AXI ADC IP cores,
     Analog Devices AD9467 High Speed analog-to-digital converters,
     Maxim max1241 analog-to-digital converters,
     Analog Devices ADIS16475 inertial measurement units,
     Atlas Scientific EZO sensors, and
     Vishay VCNL3020 proximity sensors.
<li> <b>I2C</b>:
     Qualcomm camera control interfaces,
     Baikal-T1 system controllers, and
     Nuvoton I2C controllers.
<li> <b>LED</b>:
     Dell Wyse 3020 status LED controllers,
     SGMICRO SGM3140 LED controllers, and
     Awinic AW2013 LED controllers.

     Mediatek MT6360 power-management ICs,
     ARM Secure Monitor watchdog timers,
     ARM Integrator Logic Module buses,
     NVIDIA Tegra video input controllers,
     Baikal-T1 AXI and ABP buses,
     Socionext UniPhier PCIe endpoint controllers,
     Allwinner H6 I/O memory-management units,
     Ingenic JZ47xx coprocessors,
     CellWise CW2015 batteries,
     ROHM bd99954 chargers,
     Arasan NAND flash controllers,
     Cypress CY8CTMA140 touchscreens,

     Qualcomm SNPS FEMTO USB HS PHYs,
     Cadence Salvo PHYs, and
     Intel ComboPHY subsystems.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The "RDMA network block device" allows remote access to a block device
     over RDMA using the RTRS protocol; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/aa4d16e44f60">this documentation
     patch</a> for details.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Security-related</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Mappings in <tt>/dev/mem</tt> will now be revoked if a device driver
     claims an overlapping memory range.  This effectively prevents user
     space from mapping memory-addressable devices (persistent memory, for
     example), then playing havoc with the kernel if, for example, a
     filesystem stored in that memory is mounted later on.
<li> Mitigations for the <a href="/Articles/822595/">"special register
     buffer data sampling" hardware vulnerability</a> have been merged; see <a
     href="/Articles/822596/">Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/special-register-buffer-data-sampling.rst</a>
     for more information.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Virtualization and containers</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The new <tt>virtio-mem</tt> device allows memory to be hot-plugged
     into (or unplugged from) a guest instance.  Documentation is scarce
     (nonexistent, actually) but some information can be had from <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5f1f79bbc9e2">this commit</a>.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The kcov code-coverage tool can now collect data from code running
     in software-interrupt mode.
<li> There is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9740ca4e95b4">a new set
     of locking functions</a> to be used by code that obtains
     <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  The use of the lock is unchanged for now, but this
     is intended to be a first step 
     toward improving the scalability of code protected by
     <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.
<li> The oldest version of GCC that can build the kernel is now 4.8.  Torvalds
     has <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4152d146ee21">noted</a> that
     he is tempted to go one step further (to 4.9), so that change could
     happen in the near future.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/816850/">KCSAN</a> data-race detector has been
     merged.  Note that this tool requires the (not yet released)
     Clang&nbsp;11 compiler to work properly; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/b791d1bdf921">this changelog</a>
     for more information.
<li> The x86 kernel now has a section called <tt>.noinstr.text</tt> to hold
     code that should not ever be modified by instrumentation (such as
     kprobes).  Various bits of sensitive code are being moved into that
     section; any calls from within <tt>.noinstr.text</tt> to code outside
     of the section must be specially marked; the <tt>objtool</tt> utility
     can enforce this requirement.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/076f14be7fc9">this changelog</a>
     for a description of this work and its motivation.
</ul>
<p>

The 5.8 kernel has now entered into the stabilization phase, which can be
expected to last until the final 5.8 release in early August.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Hmm, I didn't follow that link.  The noinstr part is minor compared to the rest of the changes in this merge.  The bulk is a massive rework of x86 entry tracing and RCU handling that is enabled, in part, by the noinstr changes.<br>

A rather memorable quote from the commit that's merging this work:<br>
<p>
  The lesson learned from this brain melting exercise to morph the<br>
  evolved code base into something which can be validated and understood<br>
  is that once again the violation of the most important engineering<br>
  principle "correctness first" has caused quite a few people to spend<br>
  valuable time on problems which could have been avoided in the first<br>
  place. The "features first" tinkering mindset really has to stop.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  Quotes of the week should be more prominent! Since I almost never need to click the link to the weekly edition, I didn't know they were still a thing.</font><br>
<p>
I second this opinion.<br>
<p>
Since the redesign of the LWN weekly edition, and "quotes of the week" has been too far hidden from view.<br>

Well, just do as I do and start reading with the second page.<br>
<p>
I like the current layout. The first page is things I already know so I can skip it, the second contains interesting tidbits, and the third has community stuff which I read when I feel like it.<br>
<p>
Yes you could conceivably swap the first two but that'd be another click for me, so -1. ;-)<br>

Same here. When there is a new lwn-weekly, I jump directly to page two, read the quotes of the week, quite often follow the links and learn something new - then it is time to go through the rest of the headings to see if I've overlooked something interesting during the last week.<br>

Right smack in the middle of the weekly edition item on the main feed is a link whose description ends with "Quotes". I knew what that was talking about, but maybe it deserves to be written out in full so that it registers as worthwhile for everyone just glancing at the section?<br>

I always start reading the Weekly Edition by the briefs page, and I am disappointed when I don't get my weekly dose of quotes. I discovered quite a few development blogs this way ! It has been a source of entertainment and knowledge. I don't know if the blog scene is less lively than a few years ago, but the development QOTW section is absent in a growing number of edition, which is sad.<br>

Regarding virtio-mem, besides a KVM Forum talk from 2018, there is <a href="https://virtio-mem.gitlab.io/">https://virtio-mem.gitlab.io/</a> which contains additional information. Planning to add more kernel documentation soon, thanks for the reminder.<br>

What a nice API the generalized kernel event-notification mechanism is. I was dreading clicking on it lest it turn out to be *yet another* pipeline from the kernel to userspace to join relayfs and netlink and God knows what else, but no! A pipe! A good old Unix pipe! It was like angels burst into song (clearly the pipes were organ pipes).<br>
<p>
(The ioctl part is less nice, but probably unavoidable, and at least it's really simple, and much better than, say, adding an extra pipe flag for every kind of entity you want notifications on.)<br>

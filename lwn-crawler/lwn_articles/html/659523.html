Computers tend to spend a lot of time copying files.  Often, the underlying
filesystems have ways to accelerate that task, but, as a general rule,
copying is still done with a user-space loop reading chunks of data from one
file and writing to another.  Over the years, there have been efforts to
provide access to faster file-copy mechanisms (see <a
href="/Kernel/Index/#reflink">the <tt>reflink()</tt> discussion</a>, for
example), but no solution has found its way into the mainline.  Hope
springs eternal, though, so there is a new initiative that might just make
it over the bar.
<p>
This initiative is the <a
href="/Articles/659197/"><tt>copy_file_range()</tt> patch set</a> posted by
Anna Schumaker.  It is built on some earlier work by Zach Brown, with a
number of enhancements added on top.  This patch set adds a new system
call:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t copy_file_range(int fd_in, loff_t *off_in, int fd_out,
    			    loff_t *off_out, size_t len, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
In its basic form, this system call will copy <tt>len</tt> bytes starting
at offset <tt>*off_in</tt> in the file represented by <tt>fd_in</tt> to the
offset <tt>*off_out</tt> in <tt>fd_out</tt>.  If either of the offsets is
NULL, the operation will start at the current file position (the ability to
distinguish NULL from zero is the reason why pointers are used for the
offsets).  The return 
value is the number of bytes copied, which, as usual, may be less than what
was requested.
<p>
In the initial version of <tt>copy_file_range()</tt>, the two files were
required to be on the same mount point (but they could not be the same
file), and <tt>flags</tt> had to be zero.  Anna's work has removed those
limitations and added three mutually exclusive flags:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>COPY_FR_COPY</tt> means to copy the data normally, accelerating
     the work at the filesystem level if possible.
<p>
<li> <tt>COPY_FR_REFLINK</tt> asks for the destination file to refer to the
     existing copy of the data without actually copying it.  Some
     filesystems (Btrfs, for example) are able to share references to file
     blocks in this way.
<p>
<li> <tt>COPY_FR_DEDUP</tt> is like <tt>COPY_FR_REFLINK</tt>, but it only
     succeeds if the destination range already contains the same data as the
     source.  The end result is files that look the same as before, but
     which are now sharing the data on-disk. It is thus a way of removing
     blocks of duplicated data within the filesystem.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>COPY_FR_COPY</tt> operation will, in the absence of
filesystem-level acceleration, copy the data directly through the kernel
page cache; it is essentially a <tt>splice()</tt> operation.  Copying
through the page cache in this way is clearly more efficient than doing the
copy in user space, since it avoids the need to copy the data out of the
kernel and back in again.  If possible, of course, copying with
<tt>COPY_FR_REFLINK</tt> will be the most efficient approach.
<p>
At the system-call level, only one of these flags may be set.  But, within
the kernel, the code looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
    /* Default behavior is to try both. */
    if (flags == 0)
	flags = COPY_FR_COPY | COPY_FR_REFLINK;
</pre>
<p>
So most users are likely to just want to provide zero as the <tt>flags</tt>
value; that will result in a "reflink" copy if possible, and an ordinary
copy otherwise.
<p>
At the filesystem level, the patch adds a new method to the ever-growing
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure:
<p>
<pre>
    ssize_t (*copy_file_range)(struct file *in, loff_t off_in,
    			       struct file *out, loff_t off_out,
			       size_t len, unsigned int flags);
</pre>
<p>
The interface is similar to the system call except that <tt>file</tt>
structures are used and the offsets are passed directly (reading the
offsets from user space is handled at the system-call level).  The
<tt>flags</tt> value describes how the copy should be performed; as noted
above, it might have more than one option set.  This function, if provided,
should attempt to perform the copy using the method(s) requested.  If the
function is absent or returns failure, the kernel will, if the
<tt>COPY_FR_COPY</tt> flag is set, fall back to copying through the page
cache.
<p>
This patch set has been through a number of review cycles at this point,
and the flow of comments has slowed considerably.  There do not seem to be
any concerns that would keep this work out of the 4.4 kernel at this point
— though surprises are always possible in kernel development.  Barring any
such, the long discussion on accelerated copy operations may be just about
at an end.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Is there any provision for progress reporting or cancellation?<br>

I can imagine the most benefit of this call would be for large files aka hours or days zombied in a system call. :/<br>

      Just brake the range up into management segments...

something like this..

<pre>
while (copy_file_range(fd_in, NULL, int fd_out, NULL, 1024*1024*64, 0)) {
   /* check for reason to quit */
}

      The fallback makes sense if what you want is a copy by the fastest means available.  And if you set <tt>flags</tt> to <tt>COPY_FR_REFLINK</tt>, it will <i>only</i> try the reflink copy.  Sorry if that wasn't clear in the article.

<p>
Copy_file_range() with COPY_FR_REFLINK (or COPY_FR_DEDUP) is a new way of creating reflinks, not a new sort of links, so once set up the resulting reflinks will behave just like any other reflinks. The existing definition of a reflink (as opposed to a hardlink) mandates COW if either reference is modified. Ergo, the answer to your question is "Yes".<br>

Doesn't this introduce the same problem as "sendfile": If an error is returned it's unclear if it was while reading from the source or writing to the destination (or internally in the function itself).<br>
<p>
And similarly, if the source has read more bytes than could be written, it will probably report the amount written. But will the fd_in file offset be at "*off_in+bytes written" or will it be at the point what it has actually read (which the caller won't know). The docs can mention: "always use lseek after a short copy range", but I already envision the porgrammer who uses this function and omits the lseek on retry with NULL off_in pararmeter.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  (the ability to distinguish NULL from zero is the reason why pointers are used for the offsets)</font><br>
<p>
1. Why not use "offset" combined with an extra "whence" field, with the same semantics as in the lseek() system call?<br>
<p>
2. In the absence of a "whence" field, how is the equivalent of SEEK_END specified with copy_file_range()?<br>

No, please no. To me such "I agree!" buttons are nothing more than a popularity contest. It's bad that they conflate several ideas into one press of a button (from "I agree with this statement" over "Oh that was funny" to "I highly disagree but it was a well-made argument" and even including stuff like "cool, bro!") and therefore its value is rather meaningless.<br>
<p>
It also has a negative effect on how I read such entries. If I see a negative score (on other sites, not here) then I'm more inclined to disagree with the comment in question, too. It gets even worse with badges like "reader favorite!" in green and "controversial post" in red or even "new poster". I often catch myself simply skipping entries marked as "controversial post", and that's really a shame because at that point I've stopped thinking for myself and started to agree with the popular majority out of conditioning.<br>
<p>
Even if there were an option in the user's preferences to hide the score and such badges I'm sure the fact that such a system exists often skews the way people write their texts, if only slightly.<br>
<p>
I'd really, really rather read a lot of good discussion here with a lot of posts I don't agree with after having read them then turning LWN into yet another place where conformity is rewarded. We often have awesome technical discussions here, and I'd really like to see that preserved.<br>

I think it would be fun to make mkfs.btrfs and genext2fs use copy_file_range to have zero-copy creation of disk images when the source files are on the same filesystem as the target disk image.<br>
<p>
Could be handy for making disk images for virtual machines quickly, for build isolation and the like.<br>
<p>
After you've done the build you'd need some way to get your produced files out.<br>
If the btrfs-restore command had copy_file_range support then you could get the files out again that way,<br>
I don't know of any commands to do that for ext4.<br>
<p>
When combined with the clever work the Clear Containers guys are doing, you could do isolated builds with virtual machines as quickly as you would with containers or chroots. <br>

Given that the semantics and function signature are identical to splice(), why isn't this implementation plumbed in under the existing splice() system call, in the case that neither file descriptor supplied is a pipe? Currently that's an EINVAL.<br>

The 2.5 development series included the addition of the kernel crypto API.
This interface was added to enable in-kernel code to use cryptographic
functions where needed; the IPSec code was one of its first users.  This
API has been extended since its addition, and it now supports a wide
variety of cryptographic algorithms.
<p>

There is just one little problem, however: the current Linux crypto API is
a synchronous interface.  When kernel code requests that a transformation
be applied to a block of data, that work is done immediately, with a status
value returned to the caller.  A synchronous interface works fine when the
cryptographic transformations are implemented in software.  If the CPU has
to do the work anyway, there is usually no time like the present to get it
done. 
<p>

Increasingly, however, computers are being equipped with hardware
cryptographic capabilities.  It would be nice if Linux could make use of
crypto hardware, especially on systems (such as high-bandwidth servers)
which may have to do a lot of transformations.  Hardware crypto complicates
the situation, however; hardware operations take time.  A synchronous
interface does not work well when hardware is involved; the kernel needs to
be able to go off and do other things while the hardware works through the
data.  Scheduling issues come into play as well; if a system has multiple
crypto cards installed, it would be nice to balance the load across them
and keep them all busy.
<p>

The current crypto API does not address hardware-related issues at all.
This shortcoming has been understood from the beginning; the initial crypto
API deliberately did not set out to solve the entire problem.  Hardware
support was one of those "we'll get to that later" items.
<p>

Evgeniy Polyakov, based in Russia, has gotten around to it with his posting
of an <a href="/Articles/109190/">asynchronous crypto layer patch</a>.
This large patch creates a new cryptographic API which addresses the needs
of hardware cryptography.  There is a callback-based asynchronous interface
which enables the queueing of transformation requests and notification of
their completion.  The patch not only includes load balancing; it also has
a pluggable mechanism allowing a choice of which load balancer to use.
There is a priority mechanism built in, and a failover handler which does
the right thing when a cryptographic peripheral fails.  There is even a
request routing feature for complicated transformations (encryption
followed by signing, say) which may have to be performed by a series of
devices.  
<p>

The new code has been welcomed, though the developers have a number of
issues with the specifics of the implementation.  Chances are that those
issues can be overcome, and the new asynchronous API will eventually find
its way into the mainline.  At that point, it will almost certainly
obsolete the existing crypto APIs - for both crypto users and the
implementation of software transforms.  A certain amount of scrambling will
be required to make everything work again, but, when the dust settles,
Linux should have a much more comprehensive and capable cryptographic
subsystem.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The DAMON patch set was first <a href="/Articles/812707/">covered here</a>
in early 2020; this work, now in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210716081449.22187-1-sj38.park@gmail.com/">its
34th revision</a>, enables the efficient collection of information about
memory-usage patterns on Linux systems.  That data can then be used to
influence the kernel's memory-management subsystem; one possible way to do
that is to more aggressively reclaim memory that is not being used.  To
that end, DAMON author SeongJae Park is proposing <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210720131309.22073-1-sj38.park@gmail.com/">a
DAMON-based mechanism</a> to perform user-controllable proactive reclaim.
<p>
The core idea of DAMON is to use a sampling technique to determine which
memory is in active use and which is sitting idle.  A process's virtual
address space is broken down into regions which vary in size depending on
activity; the busiest regions are then subdivided over time for more
fine-grained 
monitoring.  Within each region, a randomly selected page is watched for
activity, with the results being considered representative of the whole
region.  On 
demand, DAMON will produce a report in the form of a histogram informing
the reader of how busy each memory region is.
<p>
<h4>Putting DAMON to work</h4>
<p>
From the beginning, the motivation for this work has been to use DAMON data
to improve system performance by tweaking the operation of the
memory-management subsystem.  The initial example is the <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20201216084404.23183-1-sjpark@amazon.com/">DAMON
operation schemes (DAMOS) patch set</a>, which adds a mechanism that can make
various <a 
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html"><tt>madvise()</tt></a>
calls in response to usage patterns.  Thus, for example, a request could be
made to page out little-used memory, or to use huge pages for large, active
regions.
<p>
The proactive-reclaim patches build on DAMOS to take a more active role in
memory management.  This work adds a new kernel module that will monitor
data out of DAMON, find any regions of memory that have not been accessed
within a given time period, and actively reclaim the pages within those
regions for 
other uses, even if the system is not feeling memory pressure at the
moment.  The results, seemingly, can be impressive, with significant 
improvements to the overall performance of the system in the form of fewer
latency spikes and less time spent in direct reclaim.  Getting there
requires a number of changes, though.
<p>
The first step is to add a "pageout" scheme to DAMOS, allowing the direct
invocation of reclaim operations.  This differs from the previously
implemented <tt>madvise()</tt> mechanism in that it operates on physical
pages, while <tt>madvise()</tt> works within the virtual address space of a
single process.  As suggested by its name, <tt>madvise()</tt> is advisory,
while the new pageout scheme simply makes the reclaim happen.
It thus will be far more effective at actually pushing
pages out of memory.
<p>
<h4>Making proactive reclaim efficient</h4>
<p>
It's worth noting that proactive reclaim is not a new idea; it was <a
href="/Articles/787611/">discussed</a> at the 2019 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, for example.  At that time, the
developers present agreed that there could be value in proactively
reclaiming memory that appears to be unused; that is, after all, what the
memory-management subsystem is meant to be doing in general.  The problem
is the cost; monitoring the system closely enough to figure out which pages
are truly idle requires repeatedly scanning all of memory, which is
expensive.  That expense will, in many (if not most) cases, outweigh the
benefits of accurate proactive reclamation of pages, so this work has not
made its way into the mainline kernel.
<p>
The whole idea behind DAMON is to make this kind of monitoring cheap; 
Park described it in the proactive-reclaim cover letter this way:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Its adaptive monitoring overhead control feature minimizes its
	monitoring overhead.  It also let the upper-bound of the overhead
	be configurable by clients, regardless of the size of the
	monitoring target memory.  While monitoring 70 GB memory of a
	production system every 5 milliseconds, it consumes less than 1%
	single CPU time.
</blockquote>
<p>
The granularity of the monitoring is configurable to get the overhead
within whatever bounds the user finds acceptable; lower overhead, of
course, leads to less accurate results.  The efficiency of DAMON, it is
hoped, can help to overcome the objections to the cost of proactive
reclaim, but that is not a full solution to the problem; the reclaim
operations themselves have a cost, and that cost cannot be allowed to run
out of control.
<p>
To avoid that problem, the proactive-reclaim patch set adds a number of
knobs allowing the configuration of the new mechanism.  One knob simply
controls the amount of memory (expressed in bytes) that can be operated on
in each (configurable) unit of time.  Once that quota has been hit,
proactive reclaim will take a proactive break until the next time period
begins.  To avoid getting stuck in a single memory region, proactive
reclaim will move on to a new region in the next time slot if it runs into
the limit.
<p>
Beyond that, there is a knob setting a time quota, being the amount of CPU
time that proactive reclaim is allowed to use per time period.  Once again,
when that time is exceeded, reclaim will pause until the next time slot
opens up.  Yet another knob allows the entire mechanism to be paused if the
amount of free memory in the system exceeds a given watermark.  There is,
after all, little value to be had in using system resources to free memory
when there is already more of it than is needed.  Interestingly, proactive
reclaim can also be paused if the amount of free memory is too <i>low</i>;
in such situations, the memory-management subsystem will already be
actively reclaiming memory and it is likely better for the proactive
mechanism to just stay out of the way.
<p>
Finally, there is a prioritization mechanism.  Depending on the settings of
the quota parameters, proactive reclaim may well be unable to work through
all of memory in any reasonable time, so it makes sense to focus that work
on the regions where the most benefit will be gained.  Users can tweak yet
another set of knobs to direct reclaim to specific regions based on their
size, age, and access frequencies.
<p>
<h4>Not for everybody</h4>
<p>
All of this work leads to the creation of a new mechanism with a lot of
parameters to tweak and, probably, some real potential for harming the
performance of the system rather than helping it.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20210720131309.22073-16-sj38.park@gmail.com/">This
documentation patch</a> from the series describes the operation of this new
module in detail.  It seems unlikely to be a feature for casual users to
play with.
<p>
For administrators who need to get the best performance out of their
systems and who have the time to tune it, though, proactive reclaim may
offer some significant benefits.  Benchmark results posted with the patch
set show that an unconstrained reclaim module can free up nearly half of
the available memory, but at a cost: nearly 12% of one CPU dedicated to the
reclaim work, and a workload slowdown of just over&nbsp;5% (presumably
resulting from increased paging when reclaimed memory turns out to be
needed after all).  Applying some
quotas can cut that overhead considerably while still gaining most of the
free-memory benefit, which can be used to run other workloads.  It seems
likely, though, that the optimal settings 
will depend heavily on the nature of the workload.
<p>
The proactive-reclaim work is in its third round on the mailing lists, but
DAMON itself has now been posted 34&nbsp;times, with no clear indication of
when (or even if) it will be merged into the mainline.  Park would clearly
like to see some progress on that front; the cover letter begins with a
request for reviews of the DAMON work.  Those reviews — and an indication
of wider interest in this work — will clearly be necessary if DAMON and the
mechanisms built on it are to find their way into the mainline.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

IMHO, these days, any time you have a control knob, that&#x27;s just a learning algorithm screaming to be born. We should be using closed-loop feedback-based control algorithms --- or just machine learning --- to tweak knobs, not slow human meat brains.<br>

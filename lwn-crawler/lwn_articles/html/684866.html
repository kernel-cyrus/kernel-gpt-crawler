A feature found in some systems designed for high availability is memory
mirroring: providing two copies of data stored in main memory so that said
data can be recovered should something happen to one of the copies.  But,
as Taku Izumi noted during the memory-management track of the 2016 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, as memory sizes grow
larger, the cost of providing that mirror grows as well.  So there is
interest in building systems that only mirror part of the physical address
space.  It quickly became clear, though, that the memory-management
developers have strong doubts about the wisdom of such an arrangement.
<p>
This feature, Taku said, is managed by the low-level BIOS; it can be configured
there or by using the <tt>efibootmgr</tt> command.  The amount of memory to be
mirrored can be set there, and read from the EFI memory map by the kernel
at boot time.  Unlike fully mirrored memory, partially mirrored memory
requires support from the kernel.
The idea is to improve fault tolerance by using mirrored
memory for the kernel and its data, while putting user space in single-copy

memory.  Everything that is not mirrored would be placed into the
<tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> zone, so that kernel memory would not be allocated
there.
<p>
By default, in such a system, one would want user-space memory to be kept
out of <tt>ZONE_NORMAL</tt>, since that's where the mirrored memory is.  To
that end, a new <tt>__GFP_NONMIRROR</tt> allocation flag would be added; it
would be part of <tt>GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE</tt>.  But, occasionally, there
might be critical user data that should go into mirrored memory.  That
could be obtained via a new <tt>MADV_MIRROR</tt> flag to the
<tt>madvise()</tt> system call.
<p>
Kirill Shutemov objected that <tt>madvise()</tt> is the wrong interface to
use; placement in mirrored memory would be mandatory, while
<tt>madvise()</tt> is, as its name suggests, an advisory system call.  Rik
van Riel asked why we would want to put user-space memory into the mirrored
range; the answer seems to be to enable the running of a particularly
important virtual machine with mirroring.  The problem is that, once you
try to put a user-space program into that range, everything has to go
there, including shared libraries.  Making all that work properly could get
a little messy.
<p>
On the other hand, it was pointed out that computers exist to run
applications.  If a particular application is so important that it needs a
computer with (expensive) mirrored memory, why not protect that
application, too?  Aneesh 
Kumar said that one has to start somewhere, and that protecting the kernel
is the first step.  Protection can be expanded from there.
<p>
There was some talk about preventing user space from exhausting the
mirrored range; perhaps requesting mirrored memory should be a privileged
operation.  It's also not clear what the kernel should do if mirrored
memory runs out; should it fall back to non-mirrored memory?  The
conclusion seemed to be that falling back would remove the reliability
guarantee that mirrored memory is meant to provide, so it should not be
done.  Instead, if possible, the range of memory that is  mirrored should be
expanded.
<p>
It was Michal Hocko who raised the key objection to this scheme, though: it
threatens to bring back all of the low-memory problems that, the developers
had thought, we had finally left behind.  On 32-bit systems, only a portion
of the physical address space is directly addressable by the kernel; that
portion is called "low memory."  Kernel data structures, as a rule, can
only be placed in the low-memory region.  That has led to many problems
over the years where the system runs out of low memory and finds itself
crippled, even though quite a bit of memory is available in general.
64-bit systems do not have this problem, since they can map the entire
address range.
<p>
By creating a new zone that must contain all kernel memory, partial memory
mirroring recreates the low-memory problem.  It will place hard limits on
the amount of user-space memory that can be allocated, leading, Michal
said, to out-of-memory situations when, in fact, lots of memory is free.
Rik added that experience has shown that the ratio of non-kernel memory to
kernel-addressable memory should not go much above 4:1; after that,
problems start to develop.
<p>
Returning to the user-space side, Rik said that it would be necessary to
place some user-space data in mirrored memory.  If the init process dies
due to memory corruption, for example, the fact that the kernel is
protected will provide little comfort.  Then the C&nbsp;library probably
needs to live there, and probably no end of other things.  In the end,
Michal said, the obvious conclusion is that one should simply mirror the
entire address space.
<p>
Mike Kravetz suggested that mirrored memory could be an opt-out resource
rather than opt-in, but Kirill pointed out that an application that opts
out would likely end up placing important libraries in unmirrored memory.
Those would have to be somehow upgraded later on when another application
needs them.  Mel Gorman said that, in the end, nobody would volunteer to
opt out; as Linus <a href="/Articles/682769/">noted</a> recently, few
developers think that their application is not important. 
<p>
Mel went on to say that partial mirroring is simply the wrong approach; if
a system needs that level of reliability, he said, it should just mirror
all of memory.  Trying to work around that requirement is trading a
potential future problem (memory corruption) for a definite problem now
(kernel-memory issues).  Beyond that, we can't pretend that user space can
make mirroring decisions correctly.  Security issues remain; even if
requesting mirrored 
memory directly is a privileged operation, an unprivileged process will still
be able to force the exhaustion of mirrored memory.  There is no privilege
separation in this scheme; it promises the ability to protect specific
applications, but is unable to deliver on it.  The result will be worse
than a false hope; it will create a system that is fundamentally fragile.
<p>
Andrea Arcangeli pointed out that some of this fragility is already
inherent in the <tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> memory zone.  Mel agreed, saying that
<tt>ZONE_MOVABLE</tt> is a curse that should never have been used the way
it is.  As a result, he said, features like memory hotplug are
fundamentally broken and systems are more fragile than they should be.
But, he said, if you see a car crash, you don't normally drive in to join
it; the same approach should be taken here.
<p>
At this point, time ran out, and it became clear that the conversation was
circling around on itself.  But it was also clear that the
memory-management developers think little of the partial-mirroring idea and
would rather not see code added to the kernel to support it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I'm trying to understand this comment:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; as memory sizes grow larger, the cost of providing that mirror grows as well.</font><br>
<p>
I would have thought that the cost is constant: all memory costs twice what it did before.<br>
Obviously that isn't a constant number of dollars, but that hardly seems relevant.  If you want better quality memory, you pay a premium for all of it....<br>
<p>
Then I started thinking about RAIM ... would it be cheaper if you could configure your memory like RAID4 with a "parity memory stick"?  I wonder how easy it would be to make a memory controller which supported that...  Do they already exist?<br>
<p>
Maybe this should tie in with the "Performance-differentiated memory" issue, though here the "performance" metric includes reliability.  If you request normal memory it will be mirrored, but it might get paged out to swap.  But just for today we have a special offer - take this other memory and it won't get paged out - though maybe it will disappear if there is a hardware error.<br>

ECC memory already does this, and it can correct one-bit errors. People want to have even more reliability, though.<br>

There have been numerous proposals over the years for ways that applications can have less-than-reliable memory for things that they can recreate if needed, but (if nothing else needs the memory) are nice to keep around.<br>
<p>
Things like clean cache content, decoded images for browsers, etc.<br>
<p>
Having things like that also go into non-mirrored memory seems like a logical thing to do.<br>
<p>
If using non-mirrored memory for cached data means that you can have twice the space, I can see apps being willing to start going to the trouble of marking their recreatable data this way and checking it's availability when they try to use it again.<br>

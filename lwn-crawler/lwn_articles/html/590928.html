<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 18, 2014</br>
           </div>
As various container solutions on Linux approach maturity, distribution
developers are thinking more about the infrastructure needed to manage a
system full of containers.  Toward that goal, Vivek Goyal recently posted
<a href="/Articles/590910/">a patch</a> allowing a process to determine
which control group contains a process at the other end of a Unix-domain
socket.  The patch is relatively simple, but it still kicked off a lengthy
discussion making it clear that, among other things, there is still
resistance to using modern Linux kernel facilities to implement new
features.
<p>
The patch in question adds a new command (<tt>SO_PEERCGROUP</tt>) to the
<tt>getsockopt()</tt> system call.  A process can invoke this command on an
open Unix-domain socket and get back the name of the control group
containing the process at the other end.  Or something close to that: what
is returned is the control group the peer process was in when the
connection was established; that process may have moved in the meantime.
The information may thus be a bit outdated, but <tt>SO_PEERCGROUP</tt>
mirrors the existing <tt>SO_PEERCRED</tt> command in this regard.
Connection-time information is deemed to be good enough for the targeted
use case, which is allowing the <a href="/Articles/457415/">system security
services daemon (SSSD)</a> to make policy decisions based on which
container it is talking to.
<p>
The main critic of this patch was Andy Lutomirski, who had a number of
complaints with it.  In the end, though, the key point may have been
described in <a href="/Articles/590933/">this message</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	My a priori opinion is that this is a terrible idea.  cgroups are a
	nasty interface, and letting knowledge of cgroups leak into the
	programs that live in the groups (as opposed to the cgroup manager)
	seems like a huge mistake to me.
</div>
<p>
Part of this complaint was a bit off the mark: the idea is to not require
awareness of control groups for processes running inside containers.  But,
even without that, Andy appears to be against the use of control groups in
general.  He is certainly not alone in that point of view.
<p>
Andy came up with <a href="/Articles/590984/">three alternative
approaches</a> by which a daemon process could identify which container is
connecting to it, but those have run into resistance as well.  The first of
those was to put the containers inside <a href="/Articles/532593/">user
namespaces</a>.  The user-ID mapping performed by user namespaces would
then allow each connecting process to be identified with the existing
<tt>SO_PEERCRED</tt> mechanism or with an <tt>SCM_CREDENTIALS</tt> control
message.  Adding user namespaces to the mix should also make containers
more secure, he said.
<p>
The objection to this approach was best <a href="/Articles/590985/">summed
up</a> by Vivek:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Using user namespaces sounds like the right way to do it (at least
	conceptually). But I think hurdle here is that people are not
	convinced yet that user namespaces are secure and work well. IOW,
	some people don't seem to think that user namespaces are ready yet.
</div>
<p>
Simo Sorce <a href="/Articles/590986/">echoed</a> these concerns and also
added that he is not in a position to make the target container mechanism
(Docker) use user namespaces.  Eric Biederman, the developer of user
namespaces, <a href="/Articles/590987/">asked for specifics</a> of any
problems and observed: "<q>It seems strange to work around a feature
that is 99% of the way to solving their problem with more kernel
patches.</q>"
<p>
Strange or not, there does not appear to be a lot of interest in exploring
the use of user namespaces as a solution to this particular problem.  Like
control groups, user namespaces are a relatively new, Linux-specific
mechanism; getting developers to adopt such features is often a challenge.
In this case, concerns about a lack of maturity can only serve to deprive
user namespaces of testing, prolonging any such immaturity further.
<p>
Andy's second suggestion was to get the container information out of
<tt>/proc</tt>, using the process ID of the connecting process.  Simo
responded that use of process IDs can suffer from race conditions;
processes can come and go quickly on some systems.  The third idea was to
just keep a separate socket open into each container; this idea was
dismissed as being on the messy and inelegant side, but nobody said that it
wouldn't work.
<p>
The end result was a conversation that, by all appearances, convinced
nobody.  In the process, it has highlighted a question that often comes up
in the kernel community: once we add interesting new features, to what
extent can we integrate those features with others or expect developers to
use them?  Expect to see this kind of debate more often as the kernel
continues to develop and acquires more features that were never envisioned
by any of the Unix standards bodies.  A lot of work is going into adding
new capabilities to the kernel; it would seem strange if we were so
unconvinced by our own work that we did not expect others to make use of
it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

What we really need is a way to have race-free process management. Cgroups goes a long way towards it, but it lacks an important piece - process handles.<br>
<p>
Since we already have eventfd, timerfd and signalfd - it's only natural to have pidfd() which would allow to open processes as files, with the usual refcounted semantics.<br>

So true.<br>
<p>
But that doesn't really address the problem above. But it could if one would also have a way to:<br>
- Get a pidfd for a process connected to using a unix socket (like the SO_PEERCGROUP only than a SO_PEERPIDFD or so)<br>
- Have a method to ask the kernel to compare two pidfd and answer if it's the same process (not elegant) or better have the kernel always return the same fd when requesting multiple instances of a pidfd, though that might have some tricky performance consequences when used often<br>
<p>
For this specific problem (you receive a connection, or even better, you receive a message/dgram) you actually want a simple unique proces identifying token that:<br>
- Has no clear meaning (aka: shouldn't be able to distinguish if it's the original "init" proces or if proces A is older/newer than B)<br>
- Is unique as long as somebody could have some reference to it (like having an open pidfd() or somebody having the procdir still open or so)<br>
<p>
In that case the pidfd() logic can be used to track any and all processes it's interested in and as long as it has that information it can safely match tokens that it got via eg. recvmsg() with one of those processes (without needing any additional syscall).<br>

An interesting way to have something like pidfd is to open /proc/&lt;pid&gt; directory and hold the descriptor open. The kernel should also keep track of the open /proc/pids and do not re-use them for other processes.<br>
<p>
That should take care of most of the PID races. It should also take care of establishing the identity of the process in question.<br>

We have PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER, which makes hierarchies work quite sensibly.  When I say "hierarchy", I mean the hierarchy before reparenting kills it.<br>
<p>
The systemd folks seem to be pushing in the direction of forcing cgroups and the process hierarchy to be consistent, which suggests that what they really should be tracking is the process hierarchy, rather than overlying cgroups on top just to track things.<br>

PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER (which is a recent and non-standard option in itself) might work for the PID1 or similar-level programs, but it's far less useful for stuff like Docker's system daemon.<br>
<p>
There are several issues:<br>
<p>
1) It only works for the child processes. A system-level daemon in Docker might not be the parent of the containers. Think about a situation where you might want a system-level PostgreSQL to use cgroups for authorization.<br>
<p>
2) It doesn't solve the problem of enumeration. With cgroups it's easy to get all the processes that are confined in it and it's quite natural to use them get important statistics like RAM usage.<br>

For Docker, etc, at the end of the day, there has to be some coordination between the container manager and whatever is trying to identify processes.  (To further muddy the waters, there's setns.)<br>
<p>
For enumeration, there's /proc/pid/task/tid/children, which is currently hidden behind CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE.<br>
<p>
But things like "you might want a system-level PostgreSQL to use cgroups for authorization" bug me.  *Why* do you want PostgreSQL to use cgroups?  What are you actually trying to achieve?  Why is cgroups the right thing to use?<br>

Suppose that we have a process hierarchy in '/proc/sys/fs/cgroup/container1', perhaps also namespaced.<br>
<p>
I want to give access to these processes connecting through PostgreSQL's Unix socket as a PostgreSQL user named 'Bob'. This way processes from this container can use their databases without password-based authentication.<br>
<p>
It's certainly possible to add something like system-level credentials daemon to authorize such requests and it looks like systemd is moving in this direction. But it also looks far less elegant.<br>
<p>
And regarding /proc/pid/task/tid/children - it looks like an attempt to re-create cgroups. Which is kinda dumb, since cgroups already has a 'freeze' controller to stop process groups. It would have been natural to add support for state serialization to it. <br>
<p>
So yeah, it looks like another cgroups-related clusterk-suck.<br>

Sticking a process hierarchy in '/proc/sys/fs/cgroup/container1', by itself, is simply not valid as a credential.  It does not prevent outside processes from ptracing in.  It does not prevent outside processes from messing with the stuff inside via proc.<br>
<p>
To be fair, process hierarchies are also not useful as a security boundary.  I mentioned them because I assumed that the intended use case of SO_PEERCGROUP was to figure out where syslog messages came.  I don't think that the pid should be used for authentication.<br>
<p>
The right solution IMO is to either use namespaces directly (and to improve the API if needed) or to use multiple sockets.<br>

Of course. But in the cases where we want to do a per-cgroup authentication it's usually the case that each cgroup can't access other cgroups (because of different user IDs or namespaces).<br>
<p>
Using namespaces is a bit problematic. They are not always _necessary_ for the cgroups use-cases. For instance, we use cgroups mostly to contain the resource usage so a malfunctioning program can't OOM processes from other cgroups. There's no need to create a separate namespace - all processes use the same NFS-mounted /home partition, for example.<br>
<p>
A couple of our services use SO_PEERCRED to get the /proc/pid/cgroup information to charge resource usage to a correct task. Isolating malicious processes ptrace()-ing processes of the same user in another cgroup is not an issue for us.<br>

If you're not worried about malicious processes, why not just have the process in question send over its cgroup name?<br>

We're not worried up to a point. A user's task ptrace()-ing another task of the same user is OK. In this case it's user's own problem to find out why resources used were charged to a wrong task.<br>
<p>
However, giving users ability to impersonate other users is a no-no.<br>
<p>
Currently, we use SO_PEERCRED to get the target process ID and read /proc/pid/cgroup file. All of the sensitive information is encoded in the cgroup name so, it's not really a problem for us if there's a PID race. <br>

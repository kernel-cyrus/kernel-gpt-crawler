CPU scheduling seems to be one of those eternally unfinished jobs.
Developers can work on the CPU scheduler for a while and make it work
better, but there will always be workloads which are not served as well as
users would like.  Users of interactive systems, in particular, tend to be
sensitive to scheduler latencies.  In response, the current scheduler has
grown an elaborate array of heuristics which attempt to detect which
processes are truly interactive and give them priority in the CPU.  The
result is complicated code - and people still complain about interactive
response. 
<p>

Enter Con Kolivas, who has been working on improving interactivity for some
time.  His latest proposal is the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/224654/">Rotating Staircase Deadline
Scheduler</a> (RSDL), which attempts to provide good interactive response with a
relatively simple design, complete fairness, and bounded latency.  This
work takes ideas from 
Con's earlier staircase scheduler (<a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/87729/">covered here in June, 2004</a>), but
with a significantly different approach.
<p>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/RSDL1.png" width=300 height=196 alt="[RSDL]"
align="left" border=0 hspace=2>

Like many schedulers, the RSDL maintains a priority array, as is crudely
diagrammed to the left.  At each level there is a list of processes
currently wanting to run at that priority; each process has a quota of time
it is allowed to execute at that priority.  The processes at the highest
priority are given time slices, and the scheduler rotates through them
using a typical round-robin algorithm.
<p>
When a process uses its quota at a given priority level, it is dropped down
to the next priority and given a new quota.  That process can thus continue
to run, but only after the higher-priority processes have had their turn.
As processes move down the staircase, they increasingly must contend with
the lower-priority processes which have been patiently waiting on the lower
levels.  The
end result is that even the lowest-priority processes get at least a little
CPU time eventually.
<p>
An interesting feature of this scheduler is that each priority level has a
quota of its own.  Once the highest priority level has used its quota, all
processes running at that level are pushed down to the next-lower level,
regardless of whether they have consumed their individual CPU time quotas
or not.  As a result of this "minor rotation" mechanism, processes waiting
at lower priority levels need only 
cool their heels for a bounded period of time before all other processes
are running at their level.  The maximum latency for any process waiting to
run is thus bounded, and can be calculated; there is no starvation with
this scheduler.
<p>
As processes use up their time, they are moved to a second array, called the
"expired" array; there they are placed back at their original priority.
Processes in the expired array do not run; they are left out in the cold
until no more processes remain in the currently active array - or until all
processes are pushed off the bottom of the active array as a result of
minor rotations.  At that point, a "major rotation" happens: the active and
expired arrays are switched and the whole series of events restarts from
the beginning.
<p>

The current scheduler tries to locate interactive tasks by tracking how
often each process sleeps; those seen to be interactive are then rewarded
with a priority boost.  The RSDL does away with all that.  Instead,
processes which sleep simply do not use all of their time at the higher
priority levels.  When they run, they are naturally advantaged over their
CPU-hungry competition.  If a process sleeps through a major rotation, its
quota goes back into the run queue's priority-specific quota value.  Thus,
it will be able to run at high priority even if other high-priority
processes, which have been running during this time, have been pushed to
lower priorities through minor rotations.  All of this should add up to
quick response from interactive applications.

<P>
<a href="/Articles/224873/">A few benchmarks</a> posted by Con show
that systems running with RSDL perform slightly better than with the stock
2.6.20 scheduler.  The initial reports from testers have been positive,
with one person <a href="/Articles/224875/">urging that RSDL go into
2.6.21</a>.  That will not happen at this point in the release cycle, but
Linus <a href="/Articles/224877/">is favorable to including RSDL</a> in a
future kernel:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I agree, partly because it's obviously been getting rave reviews so
	far, but mainly because it looks like you can think about behaviour
	a lot better, something that was always very hard with the
	interactivity boosters with process state history.
</div>
<p>
Con has recently been heard to complain about difficulties getting his
interactivity improvements into the mainline.  This time around, however,
he may find the course of events to be rather more gratifying.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Lovely article ;-)<br>
<p>
It's good to see this getting some attention, as RSDL seems to be a good piece of work. Starvation has been a problem in the kernel, giving short stalls now and then. A completely fair yet interactive scheduler like this one would do away with that, at the expense of ppl having to use nice probably a bit more on heavy processes like compiling.<br>
<p>
Maybe apps like dpkg or emerge should start nicing themselves by default...<br>
<p>
Still, RSDL gives a perfectly responsive desktop even when a make -j4 is running aside with aMule, mail etcetera, so its doing better than mainline on my system already.<br>
<p>
And a better throughput is really an unexpected but nice benefit. Maybe worth mentioning RSDL does a bit better than mainline on the MySQL scaling issue:<br>

      Although it's not currently on by default, <tt>emerge</tt> will already renice itself if you set the <tt>PORTAGE_NICENESS</tt> variable in <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>. I do this so that an emerge doesn't kill system performance.

      Apt and dpkg are not, in general, CPU bound, but I/O bound. Nicing I/O bound processes generally causes more problems than it solves, because you end up blowing the file cache.<br>

<p>
Yes, indeed.  But every time I see an article like this, I can't help but think back to that time, some years ago, when interest in the Linux process scheduler really fired up.  It may have been during 2.1.x, but I can't remember for sure.<br>
<p>
I do remember Linus stating on LKML that he didn't think that process scheduling was very interesting.  In his opinion, process scheduling was the sort of thing that you worked on, got right, and then left for a project that was actually challenging.<br>
<p>
I wonder how he might have responded to a proposal called the "Rotating Staircase DeadLine Scheduler" back then? <br>
<p>
At any rate, RSDL is doomed once I finish up and present my Dimensionally Transcendent Lorentzian Transformational Scheduler.  It's almost finished.  But seems to be stuck in a loop at the moment... ;-)<br>

<p>
Huh. A scheduler that's larger on the inside than the outside. You do realize that you'll have to return the book you copied it from to the Panopticon Library on Gallifrey?
<p>
At one point, HP produced a scheduler plugin system. If anyone has a copy of that still, there may be ideas in it worth plundering, err re-using, as no algorithm is going to be good for all cases. What you want is a hypervisor of some sort to analyze the generalized characteristics and swap scheduler if the one currently running is unsuitable for the problem at hand.

      On my system, KDE's 3.5.5 Konqueror uses CPU time in a very strange way. It sleeps for about 60% of time, then does something CPU-intensive for 40%. Its interchanging sleeps/runs are quite short, so its priority is not lowered by the scheduler, and its CPU consumption has its visible impact on Mozilla Seamonkey 1.1.1 running in the nearby X session on the same CPU. Manual renicing of Konqueror to level 19 helps, but should not it be automatic ?<br>
<p>
I wonder if this new scheduler can detect such "isochronous" CPU consumers and deal with them accordingly ?<br>

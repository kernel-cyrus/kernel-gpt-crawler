           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 8, 2017</br>
           </div>
The kernel contains a large number of header files used to declare data
structures and functions needed in more than one source file.  Many are
small and only used in a few places; others are large and frequently
included.  Header files have a tendency to build up over time since they
often do not get as much attention as regular C&nbsp;source files.  But
there can be costs associated with bloated and neglected header files, as a
current project to clean up one of the biggest ones shows.
<p>
The 0.01 kernel release contained a grand total of 31 header files, nine of
which lived in <tt>include/linux</tt>.  One of those,
<a href="/Articles/713897/"><tt>&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</tt></a>,  weighed in
at all of 230 lines — the largest header file in that directory.  Things
have changed just a little bit since then. 
The upcoming 4.10 kernel contains 18,407 header files, just under 10,000 of
which are intended for use outside of a specific subsystem.  The <a
href="/Articles/713896/">4.10 version of <tt>&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</tt></a>
is 3,674 lines, but that understates its true weight: it directly includes
50 other header files, many of which will have further includes of their
own.  This is not the 0.01 <tt>&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</tt> anymore.
<p>

Ingo Molnar has <a href="/Articles/713712/">decided</a> that it is time to
do something about this header file.  A large header has its costs,
especially when it is (by your editor's count) directly included into 2,500
other files in the kernel.  An extra 1,000 lines of bloat expands into
2.5&nbsp;million lines more code that must be compiled in a (full) kernel
build, slowing compilation times significantly.  A large and complex header
file is also difficult to maintain and difficult to change; there are too
many subtle dependencies on it throughout the kernel.
<p>
How did this file get into this condition?  As Molnar put it:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The main reason why it's so large is that since Linux 0.01 it had
	been the Rome of the kernel: all headers lead to it, due to almost
	every kernel subsystem having fields embedded in task_struct.
	sched.h has to know about the various structure definitions of
	various kernel subsystems - even if the scheduler never makes direct
	use of 90% of those fields.
</div>
<p>
Molnar's response is a petite 89-part patch set intended to disentangle the
<tt>sched.h</tt> mess.  It starts by splitting out many of the more
esoteric scheduler interfaces that are not needed by most users of
<tt>&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</tt>.  This header is often included by driver
code, which 
typically needs a small subset of the available interfaces, but which has
no use for CPU frequency management, CPU hotplugging, accounting, or many
other scheduler details.  Code that needs the more specialized interfaces
can find a set 
of smaller header files under <tt>include/linux/sched</tt>, but, Molnar
says, 90% of users have no need for those other files.
<p>
Beyond the split-up, the patch set cleans up the interfaces with a number
of other "<q>entangled</q>", heavily-used header files so that each
can be included separately.  That eliminates the need to include those
headers in <tt>sched.h</tt>.  There was also a certain amount of
historical cruft: header files that may have been needed at one time, but
which were never removed from <tt>sched.h</tt> when that need went away.
<p>
The result is a leaner <tt>sched.h</tt> that, Molnar says, can save 30
seconds on an <tt>allyesconfig</tt> kernel build.  There are some details to
be taken care of, though, beyond fixing source files that need the
interfaces that have been split out to their own files.  Since
<tt>sched.h</tt> included so many other files, code that included it could
get away without including the others, even if it needed them.  Kernel code
is supposed to explicitly include every header it needs and not rely on
secondary inclusions but, if the code compiles anyway, it is easy to
overlook a missing <tt>#include</tt> line.  Taking those inclusions out of
<tt>sched.h</tt> meant fixing up code elsewhere in the kernel that stopped
compiling.
<p>
After this work is done, the resulting patch set touches nearly 1,200
files; it is not a lightweight change, in other words.  Molnar suggested
that the patch set should be applied at the end of the merge window in the
hope of minimizing the effects on other outstanding patches.  He did not
specify <i>which</i> merge window he was targeting; 4.11 might still be
possible and might be as reasonable a choice as any.  Most patch sets are
expected to spend some time in linux-next for wider testing, but this set
almost certainly cannot go there without creating a massive patch-conflict
nightmare.
<p>
There are some changes that will need to be made before this work can be
merged, though.  Linus Torvalds <a href="/Articles/713910/">liked the end
result</a>, but was not pleased with how the patch set is organized.  The
changes are mixed together in a way that makes the patches hard to review
and which, as was seen in a couple of cases, makes it easy for mistakes to
slip in.
<p>
He suggested that, instead, the series should start by splitting out parts of
<tt>sched.h</tt>, but leaving things externally the same by including the
split-out files back into <tt>sched.h</tt>.  These changes could thus be
made without changing code elsewhere in the kernel.  After that, the
back-includes could be removed, one by one, with the necessary fixes being
applied elsewhere.  The patches in this part of the series would consist of
only <tt>#include</tt> changes and would, thus, be quick to review and
verify.  Molnar <a href="/Articles/713911/">agreed</a> to rework the
patches along these lines, though he warned that this work "<q>will
increase the patch count by at least 50%</q>".  Making the patch set
easier to review (and to bisect) will, hopefully, more than make up for the
increased patch count.
<p>
If this work can be completed in a convincing way before the close of the
merge window, it may well make sense to apply it right away, even though
the combination of big, intrusive, and new normally suggests that it may be
better to wait.  Causing this work to sit out for another development cycle
would force much of it to be redone, and the end result may not be any more
"ready" in 4.12 than it would be for 4.11.  Of course, once this patch set
is merged and the final loose ends tied down, the work is not yet done;
there are a number of other large and messy header files in the kernel tree.
The next target for a split-up may be another huge header file present since
the 0.01 release: <tt>&lt;linux/mm.h&gt;</tt>.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

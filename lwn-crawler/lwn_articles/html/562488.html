There has long been a desire for an <tt>flink()</tt> system call in the
kernel.  It would take a file descriptor and a file name as arguments
and cause the name to be a new hard link to the file behind the
descriptor.  There have been concerns about security, though, that have
kept this call out of the kernel; some see it as a way for a process to
make a file name for a file descriptor that came from outside — via
<tt>exec()</tt>, for example.  That process may not
have had a reachable path to the affected file before, so the creation of a
new name could be seen as bypassing an existing security policy.
<p>
The problem with this reasoning, as noted by Andy Lutomirski in <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/bb2314b47996491bbc5add73633905c3120b6268">a
patch</a> merged for 3.11-rc5, is that this functionality is already
available by way of the <tt>linkat()</tt> system call.  All it takes is
having the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem mounted — and a system without
<tt>/proc</tt> is quite rare.  But the incantation needed to make a link in
this way is a bit arduous:
<p>
<pre>
    linkat(AT_FDCWD, "/proc/self/fd/N", destdirfd, newname, AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW);
</pre>
<p>
Where "<tt>N</tt>" is the number of the relevant file descriptor.
It would be a lot nicer, he said, to just allow the use of the
<tt>AT_EMPTY_PATH</tt> option, which causes the link to be made to the file
behind the original file descriptor:
<p>
<pre>
    linkat(fd, "", destdirfd, newname, AT_EMPTY_PATH);
</pre>
<p>
In current kernels, though, that option is restricted to processes with the
<tt>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</tt> capability out of the same security concerns
as described above.  But, as Andy pointed out, the restriction makes no
sense given that the desired functionality is available anyway.  So his
patch removes the check, making the second variant available to all users.  
This functionality is expected to be useful with files opened with the
<tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> option, but other uses can be imagined as well.  It will
be generally available in the 3.11 kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      <p>I see kernel developers adopt NASA attitude: <i>We have also found that certification criteria used in flight readiness reviews often develop a gradually decreasing strictness. The argument that the same risk was flown before without failure is often accepted as an argument for the safety of accepting it again. Because of this, obvious weaknesses are accepted again and again—sometimes without a sufficiently serious attempt to remedy them, sometimes without a flight delay because of their continued presence.</i></p>

<p>We all know what was the end result <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster">in NASA's case</a> and I'm afraid results for kernel will be similar.</p>

<p>If some desired-yet-dangerous functionality is available via some backdoor it's not enough justification to enable straightforward use of it! It may be better to close the backdoor…</p>

<p>I wonder what kind of disaster needs to happen before kernel developers accept that fact.</p>

      Hmmm.  <i>If</i> there was any kind of rational model behind Linux security &mdash; for example a model with a small kernel which could be automatically proved correct &mdash; then this would make sense.

<p>
But Linux security is all over the place.  There are surely many combinations of system calls that allow you to bypass checks and escalate privileges ("backdoors") and this is just one of them.  No one has written the clever program to find the others yet, but it's just a matter of time.

<p>
Rich.

I'm not sure who "upstream" is.  The advisory came to (at least) me and Oleg via Petr Matousek, citing a tweet that had no meaningful information.  (Maybe it was the wrong link?

I presume that 51f7f259cb6a0d5e380dcd2286c64118809d8df19761c1699b60001d55126c0b is the sha256 hash of something.  If so, it will establish that you know something now, but it's not helping me or the other kernel contributors.<br>

In any case, if you can explain what's wrong with my patch and if I fix it, I will certainly attribute it properly.<br>

kernel devs who censor security related information from patches. (e.g., what happened to the CVE that was already assigned by the time the patch got written?)<br>

<p>
not sure who 'we' is, but Petr did that work for you regardless and if you hadn't quoted him selectively you'd have also realized what it meant:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; b836010000bb00000010cd80ebf2 is for(;;)unshare(1&lt;&lt;28);</font><br>
<p>
can't be more concise, can it? one wonders how you were able to pull off that vsyscall change 2 years ago (nice not crediting me there btw) when you seemingly don't even recognize x86 asm.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; If so, it will establish that you know something now, but it's not helping me or the other kernel contributors.</font><br>
<p>
yes, that's kinda the point behind publishing hashes only. as for helping you, we won't disclose such information because it would then be censored (just look at what happened recently with rmk's arm fixes) which is a game we will never play. this is not negotiable.<br>

      By saying "we won't disclose such information because it would then be censored" you're revealing your true face&mdash;helping the community is a minor goal compared to the fame you get by being credited for all the security bugs.

It's interesting that you twisted the quote in such a way as to create the straw man you want to demonize.<br>
<p>
The main point was the complete absence of any mention of security impact in the commit message (what the "censorship" of disclosure) was referring to.  Choosing not to attribute it as well was just the icing on the spite cake.<br>
<p>
Here are the facts:<br>
I reported this directly to Petr on IRC<br>
I had already fixed the vulnerability myself in the one affected grsecurity patch the night before, with an unmistakable commit message<br>
Security impact was known at the time the patch was created<br>
A CVE had already been allocated prior to the patch being created<br>
<p>
No CVE or impact at all was mentioned in the commit<br>
It seems that despite a bug being a bug (according to Linus) the advice from Andrew Morton (<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/6/13/502">https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/6/13/502</a>) continues to be ignored quite often specifically for security vulnerabilities<br>
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=c98ebcb618645d40cfec14b0534ff32126c114ce">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux...</a><br>
Everyone whose name appears on that commit is complicit in the behavior, no matter what they say about how they really feel about the upstream security disclosure policies on private mailing lists or in private mail because they don't want to upset Linus' silent-fix campaign.<br>
<p>
Since when does my sphere of responsibility extend beyond my own users?  Any direct reporting we've done is not under any kind of obligation (of the kind upstream has to the code they distribute), and you should understand it in that context.  We find and fix tons of problems in the upstream kernels, including finding many security fixes that fall through the backporting cracks (due in large part to the active cover-up policy) -- this is but one minor example because I chose to directly report it due to the apparent complete absence of QA regarding the use of unprivileged user namespaces.  As I mentioned in my commit message, it's a trivial, 22 character local DoS (which I think may be the smallest ever reported).  <br>
<p>
Now, try hard to think about this as a smart person would: if some group were consistently finding vulnerabilities in my software, would it not be wise to monitor that code to spot those things, given that they're not being obfuscated at all?  Apparently in 13 years, the Linux kernel devs still have not figured this one out. "That's work they shouldn't have to do!" a hypocrite might say.  Yes, just as I shouldn't have to be scouring upstream commits (across all developers, not just us two, so there's quite some asymmetry of effort here) to find the silent security fixes falling through the cracks.<br>
<p>
I believe in the old adage that actions speak louder than words.  I've "joined the dark side" because I refuse to support and enable a system actively engaged in pulling the wool over your eyes as to the security of their code?  Apparently as the arbitrator of ethics and morality, do you suggest I continue to piss away one-off vulnerabilities so they can be fixed in a one-off fashion with the associated coverup?  Do you not see the long-term ramifications of that in pursuit of some short-term benefit?<br>

Well, the changelog explains that we leak the memory. Doesn't<br>
this obviously mean the bad impact?<br>
<p>
I do not think that the fact it was reported via oss-sec list<br>
does matter, the bug is bug. In fact I didn't even notice this<br>
list in CC.<br>
<p>
But. I am really sorry I didn't add Reported-by tag, seriously.<br>
This is only because I didn't know whom should we thank. I sent<br>
the patch for review and I specially asked about the reporter,<br>
but the patch was merged immediately and I could not update the<br>
changelog.<br>

Does it?  There are no matches for either "leak" or "memory" in the commit message.<br>
<p>
There is only vague mention of unspecified "side effects" that need "taking care of" in response to a function failure.  Failures can be of the unfailable kmalloc+GFP_KERNEL kind, after all.  I wonder how anyone, not already knowing about the CVE and public disclosure from elsewhere, would have any clue what the impact of that fix is.<br>
<p>
Are you really trying to say the commit message was written with clarity and transparency of the impact of the fix in mind, without some Linus-enforced brain filter on what words you're allowed to use to describe the "bug"?<br>

<p>

OK. When I reread it I agree, it could be more clear. Trust me,<br>
this was not intentional. I did not try to "hide" the fact this<br>

      There's a difference between recognizing x86 <em>machine code</em> and recognizing x86 <em>assembler</em>; it's not like it's a PDP-11 where the octal dump is human-readable with only a modicum of skill.

not the least because an assembler (a tool) is a very different animal from assembly (a language) and my use of 'asm' didn't refer to either ;).<br>

There had been some discussion in private I guess but no progress, so Willy contacted me in private (hopefully not as an example of <a href="http://www.storyit.com/Classics/Stories/foxcrow.htm">http://www.storyit.com/Classics/Stories/foxcrow.htm</a>).  The above matches up with what I explained to Willy in private mail that I believe was then passed on to security@kernel.org that the current /proc/pid/fd behavior is a security problem in the context of the old arguments against flink (from 1998!, 2002, 2003, etc) but that Andy's change made it even worse by extending that problem into chroots where /proc typically is not mounted, resulting in an initial patch some very short time later.  See:<br>

Something about those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it...<br>
<p>
FWIW I strongly urged some kind of comprehensive documentation regarding the "interesting corner cases" and how they're affected by Xat(), AT_EMPTY_PATH, chroot, namespaces, etc, since no single person is going to be able to ramble every combination of ramifications off the top of their head, and there's a very small group of people right now deciding how the interfaces work.<br>
<p>
Khim above really nailed the problem of the slippery slope;  I'm at least encouraged that this particular problem doesn't seem to be being fixed in a one-off fashion.<br>

      Hey Brad,
<p>
Concerning "<i>Willy contacted me in private (hopefully not as an example of http://www.storyit.com/Classics/Stories/foxcrow.htm)</i>", I wanted to confirm this was not such an example (it's a bit hurtful), I was sincere and wanted to see progress made after I failed on your challenge for a whole week-end looking in the wrong direction (as you noticed BTW).
<p>
Then I passed my understanding of the problem (no single line of your e-mail as you requested) to the sec list, my understanding was not 100% accurate but that was enough for others to guess it and at the same time you corrected me, then Andy replied with you and LKML in Cc so you had the rest of all the thread.
<p>
And the thread that started next on how to globally solve the issue goes in the direction you hoped for. It was a good exercise for me but I think that if you had explained your concern to the authors from the start we'd have saved one week (but I wouldn't have learned the *at syscalls :-)).
<p>
I still hope to see you one day participate to this list to help fix critical issues faster and/or better.
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Willy

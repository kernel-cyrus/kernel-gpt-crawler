           </div>
<p>
The kernel tree for the ARM architecture is large and fairly complicated.
Because of the large number of ARM system-on-chip (SoC) variants, as well
as different versions of the ARM CPU itself, there is something of a
combinatorial explosion occurring in the architecture tree.  That, in turn,
led to something of an <a href="/Articles/392135/">explosion</a> from Linus
Torvalds 
as he is getting tired of "<q>pointless churn</q>" in the tree.

</p>

<p>
A <a href="/Articles/392138/">pull request</a> from Daniel Walker for some
updates to <tt>arch/arm/mach-msm</tt> was the proximate cause of
Torvalds's unhappiness, but it goes deeper than that.  He responded to
Walker's request, by pointing out a problem he sees with ARM:
<div class="BigQuote">
There's something wrong with ARM development. The amount of pure noise in 
the patches is incredibly annoying. Right now, ARM is already (despite me 
not reacting to some of the flood) 55% of all arch/ changes since 2.6.34, 
and it's all pointless churn in 
<pre>
	arch/arm/configs/
	arch/arm/mach-xyz
	arch/arm/plat-blah
</pre>
and at a certain point in the merge window I simply could not find it in 
me to care about it any more.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He goes on to note that the majority of the diffs are
"<q>mind-deadening</q>" because they aren't sensibly readable by
humans.  He further <a href="/Articles/392145/">analyzes the problem</a> by
comparing the sizes of the x86 and ARM trees, with the latter being some
800K lines of "code"&mdash;roughly
three times the size of x86.  Of that, 200K
lines are default config (i.e. defconfig) files for 170+ different SoCs.
To Torvalds, those 
files are "<q>pure garbage</q>".
</p>

<p><blockquote class="ad">

</blockquote>
<p>
In fact, he is "<q>actually considering just getting rid of all the 'defconfig' 
files entirely</q>".  Each of those files represents the configuration
choices someone made when building a kernel for a specific ARM SoC, but
keeping them around is just a waste, he <a
href="/Articles/392146/">said</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
And I suspect that it really is best to just remove the existing defconfig 
files. People can see them in the history to pick up what the heck they 
did, but no way will any sane model ever look even _remotely_ like them, 
so they really aren't a useful basis for going forward.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Another problem that Torvalds identified is the proliferation of
platform-specific drivers, which could very likely be combined into shared
drivers in the <tt>drivers/</tt> tree or coalesced in other ways.
Basically, "<q>we need somebody who cares, and 
doesn't just mindlessly aggregate all the crud</q>".  Ben Dooks <a
href="/Articles/392158/">agreed</a> that there is a problem, but that "<q>many of the big company players have
yet to really see the necessity</q>" of combining drivers.  He also
noted that at least some of the defconfig files were being used in
automated build testing, but did agree that there are older defconfigs that
should be culled.
</p>

<p>
Dooks also had a longer <a href="/Articles/392160/">description</a> of
the problems that ARM maintainers have in trying to
support so many different SoCs, while also trying to reduce the size and
complexity of the sub-architecture trees.  Essentially, the maintainers are
swamped and "<q>until it
hits these big companies in the pocket it [is] very difficult to get them
to actually pay</q>" for cleaning up the ARM tree and keeping it clean
in the future.
</p>

<p>
Because Torvalds said that he was planning to remove the ARM (and other)
defconfig 
files, ARM maintainer Russell King <a href="/Articles/392164/">posted a
warning</a> to the linux-arm-kernel mailing list:
<div class="BigQuote">
Linus doesn't appear to be listening to reason, so I see now this as
a fait accompli.  It'll [apparently] happen at the next merge window.
<p>
So, don't send anything which contains a defconfig file or updates to
it.  It's pointless.
</div>
</p>

<p>
That set off a separate discussion on that mailing list&mdash;King's and
others' attempts to redirect it back to linux-kernel
notwithstanding&mdash;about ways to reduce the amount of mostly redundant
information carried around in the defconfig files.  Ryan Mallon is in favor
of <a href="/Articles/392167/">proactively eliminating some defconfigs</a>,
while others discussed various ways to only keep the deltas between the
config files for various SoCs.
</p>

<p>
Based on Torvalds's comments on linux-kernel, some kind of delta scheme is
unlikely to fly.  His main complaint is that the defconfig files are neither
readable nor writable by humans, as they are
generated by various tools.  He made some specific suggestions of alternatives
that would still allow the generation of those config files, using
Kconfig files that are usable by humans.
</p>

<p>
Reducing the number of defconfigs, as Mallon suggested, may be helpful, but
King at least is convinced that it doesn't go far enough.  He <a
href="/Articles/392173/">believes</a> that Torvalds has already made up his
mind to remove the defconfigs in the next merge window and that the ARM
community better be ready with something else:
<div class="BigQuote">
I believe the only acceptable solution is to get an [alternative] method
in place - no matter what it is - and remove the all but one of the
defconfig files from the mainline kernel.  _And_, most importantly,
kautobuild needs to be fixed so that we still get build coverage.
<p>
The loss of kautobuild is a major concern here, and I believe it trumps
everything else for the next merge window.  Kautobuild is an extremely
important resource that we simply can not afford to lose.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The discussion ranged from possible solutions to the immediate defconfig
problem to the larger issue of reducing the duplication throughout the ARM
trees.  There is an <a
href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Specs/ARMSingleKernel">effort</a> underway to produce a single kernel that
would support multiple ARM platforms for Ubuntu 10.10, which will
likely help consolidate various sub-architectures.  Given that Canonical is
working closely with the newly formed <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/391189/">Linaro</a>
organization&mdash;founded to simplify ARM Linux&mdash;there is reason to believe that things will get better.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, though, back on linux-kernel, Torvalds started a new thread to
flesh out 
his ideas for a hierarchical collection of Kconfig files that would
essentially take the place of the defconfigs.  After some back and forth,
Torvalds gave an <a href="/Articles/392195/">example</a> of exactly what
he is suggesting:
<div class="BigQuote">
Let's say that I want a x86 configuration that 
has USB enabled. I can basically _ask_ the Kconfig machinery to generate 
that with something like this:
<p>
 - create a "Mykconfig" file:
<pre>
	config MYCONFIG
		bool
		default y
		select USB

	source arch/x86/Kconfig
</pre>
and then I just do
<pre>
	KBUILD_KCONFIG=Mykconfig make allnoconfig
</pre>
and look what appears in the .config file.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He goes on to describe a theoretical <tt>Kconfig.omap3_evm</tt> file that
sets the specific requirements for that platform and then includes
<tt>Kconfig.omap3</tt>.  That file sets up whatever is required for the
OMAP3 platform and includes <tt>Kconfig.arm</tt>.  That would allow
developers or tools like kautobuild to generate the necessary config files
<i>without</i> having to carry them around in the kernel tree.  Those
Kconfig files would also be much more readable and any diffs would be
understandable, which is important to Torvalds.
</p>

<p>
That solves a significant subset of the problem, but there is still a fly
in the ointment: dependencies.  In Torvalds's example, <tt>CONFIG_USB</tt>
requires <tt>CONFIG_USB_SUPPORT</tt>, so that would need to be added to
<tt>Mykconfig</tt>.  Not accounting for dependencies will get you a kernel
that doesn't build or, worse yet, won't run 
correctly. 
There are a number of possible solutions to the dependency problem, though,
ranging 
from Catalin Marinas's <a
href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/9/16/413">patch</a> to track unmet
dependencies of options used in <tt>select</tt> statements to Vegard
Nossum's summer 
of code <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/5/17/164">project</a> to add a
satisfiability solver into the configuration editors (menuconfig, etc.).

<p>
It certainly seems likely that defconfig files will be removed from the kernel
tree in the 2.6.36 merge window.  Whether there is another
solution&mdash;based on Torvalds's ideas or something else&mdash;to replace
them is really up to the architecture teams as Torvalds is <a href="/Articles/392199/">perfectly happy</a>
to move on without them.  ARM, PowerPC, MIPS, and
others all have lots of defconfig files, but unless he changes his
mind, they won't in a few short months.  They can keep maintaining those
files in a separate repository somewhere, or find an acceptable method to
generate them. While it may be painful in the
short term, it will reduce the size of the kernel tree and make Torvalds's
job easier, both of which are worth striving for.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Once again, Linus getting grumpy leads to neat stuff. Picking a defconfig file for a bare ARM chip brings in too much useless stuff (someone else's choices for SLAB allocator, LCD support, etc).  As the article says, it's rare to use one without changes. Heck, how many people use the default x86 kernel config without changing something before compiling?<br>
<p>
In fact, I think "make menuconfig" should save the set of "local overrides". This file could be copied from one kernel version to the next, instead of the entire .config. It will also make it trivial to see what things you've messed with.<br>

I see as most fundamental design flaw, that config files has<br>
not defined negative answer (CONFIG_xxx=n) as valid and stored<br>
option. This would allow to use config fragments which could<br>
override previously selected defaults and values from system<br>
provided config_def files. The Debian system uses some way<br>
how to combine config fragments already.<br>
<p>
Other problem is, that the kconfig should allow export<br>
of options touched by user and config file should hold<br>
classification of value origin<br>
<p>
  kconfig_default automatic_select default_config user<br>
<p>
This would allow fragment export even in future kconfig<br>
based tools run. The internals of kconfig already provide<br>
mechanisms which could be base for such options management.<br>

I wish we had someone like Linus in the GCC community. Someone able to say, "Well, it sucks and we all know it, too! So I am going to remove it and if you care enough, you should come up with a better way!" This is the only way to keep a huge code base maintainable.<br>

Personally I still use miniconfigs.  I submitted them several times, the kernel guys didn't want to merge them (one of those "do this huge new pile of work and then we'll think about it" things, which went on my todo list 5 years ago and is still there), but I still happily use them out of tree...<br>

Not just for the kernel, either:<br>

      Dropping defconfigs causes one new problem:  no longer is it practical
to just take a kernel tree and build for a board; you've got to do a
bunch of homework to find some board-specific config working with that
board.  Consult lots of board docs (if you can even find them!) and
enable all the board-specific hardware.

Workable, yes, but this creates new obstacles for embedded developers.
And they have too many of them already.

Wouldn't it be nice if the board manufactures just gave you a .config file for their board? They put the effort into making the board docs, it doesn't seem like much more effort to match that spec with the kernel .config. Even if the .config they offer for download starts to get stale, you're one "make oldconfig" away from a working .config.<br>

I can dream, can't I? ;)<br>

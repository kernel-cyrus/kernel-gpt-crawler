<h1>The new timerfd() API</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>September 25, 2007</br>
           </div>
The <tt>timerfd()</tt> system call was added in the 2.6.22 kernel.  The
core idea behind <tt>timerfd()</tt> - allowing a process to associate a
file descriptor with timer events - is not controversial, but the
implementation of this idea did, belatedly, <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/245533/">raise a few eyebrows</a>.  In
particular, Michael Kerrisk pointed out that <tt>timerfd()</tt> was
inconsistent with (and less powerful than) the existing timer-related
system calls, and, besides, the 2.6.22 version did not even work as
advertised.  After a 
fair amount of discussion, it became clear that the issues with this system
call would not be worked out in the 2.6.23 time frame.  So the 2.6.23-rc7
prepatch disabled <tt>timerfd()</tt> altogether in an attempt to prevent
application developers from using an API which is going to change.
<p>

Prompted by all of this, Davide Libenzi (the creator of the original
<tt>timerfd()</tt> system call) has posted <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/251227/">a proposal for a revised
<tt>timerfd()</tt> API</a>.  The single system call has turned into three
different calls with a few new features.
<p>

Under the new API, an application wanting to create a file descriptor for
timer events would make a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int timerfd_create(int clockid);
</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>clockid</tt> describes which clock should be used; it will be
either <tt>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</tt> or <tt>CLOCK_REALTIME</tt>.  The return
value will, if all goes well, be the requested file descriptor.
<p>
A timer event can be requested with:
<p>
<pre>
    int timerfd_settime(int fd, int flags, const struct itimerspec *timer,
			struct itimerspec *previous);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>fd</tt> is a file descriptor obtained from
<tt>timerfd_create()</tt>, and <tt>timer</tt> gives the desired expiration
time (and re-arming interval value, if desired).  This time is normally a
relative time, but if the timer sets the 
<tt>TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME</tt> bit in <tt>flags</tt>, it will be interpreted as
an absolute time instead.  If <tt>previous</tt> is not <tt>NULL</tt>, the
pointed-to structure will be filled with the previous value of the timer.
This ability to obtain the previous value is one of the features which was
lacking in the original <tt>timerfd()</tt> implementation.
<p>
That implementation also had no way for an application to simply ask what
the current value of the timer was.  The new API provides a function for
querying a timer non-destructively:
<p>
<pre>
    int timerfd_gettime(int fd, struct itimerspec *timer);
</pre>
<p>
This system call will store the current expiration time (if any) associated
with <tt>fd</tt> into <tt>timer</tt>.
<p>
The <tt>read()</tt> interface is essentially unchanged.  A process which
reads on a timer file descriptor will block if the timer has not yet
expired.  It will then read a 64-bit integer value indicating how many
times the timer has expired since it was last read.  A timer file
descriptor can be passed to <tt>poll()</tt>, allowing timers to be handled
in an applications main event loop.
<p>

Responses to the new API proposal have been muted at best; hopefully this
silence means that developers are happy with the new system calls.  The
alternative is that this iteration of <tt>timerfd()</tt> will not be
reviewed any more extensively than its predecessor was.  As things stand,
the new set of system calls looks likely to be merged for 2.6.24.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Someone recently made a comment that a non trivial program should be written[**] to use the new API before it became set in stone. I certainly think that this would be a good idea. Some API additions are obviously right, but with most of them I expect that this is not so until it has been tested in real usage.<br>
<p>
Perhaps new APIs should be flagged beta until this has been done and the result discussed. The reason that we don't like changing APIs is because it will break code "out there" - ie code that we don't know about. If someone wants to use a beta API then they take it upon themselves to check that the kernel API has not changed.<br>
<p>
Kernel developers should be encouraged to listen to application developers who use beta APIs.<br>
<p>
[**] or something existing adapted to use it.<br>

      I have not followed this, and my quick tracing of articles didn't lead to answers to a few questions that I have.
<p>
<ol>
<li>What error is returned if a non-timer fd is used in a call to timerfd_settime() or timerfd_gettime()?</li>
<li>What error is returned (if any) when a timer fd is passed to close()?</li>
<li>Are the timer fds unique across the entire system?</li>
<li>Are timer fds inherited or duplicated across a fork? Exec?</li>
<li>Are timers destoryed when the process ends?</li>
<li>Can one process set a timer for another?</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the answer to #6 is "Yes", it would introduce a nice IPC mechanism that I could see being useful in GUI, simulation, and automated test software.  Of course, the answer to #6 depends on #s 3 and 4.  Also, certain of these would have security implications as well.
<p>
I suppose I ought to get a recent kernel source distro, apply the proposed patches, then search out the man page, look at the implementation, and see if I can find any flaws in the API that should be addressed.

      The right place to ask these (good) questions is of the developer, on the kernel mailing list.  But, here goes:<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;   1. What error is returned if a non-timer fd is used in a </font><br>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;      call to timerfd_settime() or timerfd_gettime()?</font><br>
<p>
I have not tested this, but it should give EINVAL.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;   2. What error is returned (if any) when a timer fd is passed to close()?</font><br>
<p>
That is not an error.  See the man page:<br>
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/584510">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/584510</a><br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;   3. Are the timer fds unique across the entire system?</font><br>
<p>
No.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;   4. Are timer fds inherited or duplicated across a fork? Exec?</font><br>
<p>
Yes and yes.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;   5. Are timers destroyed when the process ends?</font><br>
<p>
The file descriptor is closed.  If some other process has a file descriptor (because of fork(), for example), then I believe the timer should continue to exist.  This should be tested.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt;   6. Can one process set a timer for another?</font><br>
<p>
See 5.<br>

      Thanks for the response.  I'd not seen the manpage before.  I'm not on the kernel mailing list due <br>
to lack of time right now.<br>
<p>
I did some development on an embedded kernel some years ago that had a feature similar to <br>
these timers.  They could be annonymous (not visible to other tasks) or named.  Named timers <br>
persisted from creation to the end of time (well, until you shut down or reset the box) -- it was <br>
an embedded system, we didn't need to delete them.  A named timer could be created and set, <br>
then closed.  Any task could open the timer and do a blocking read, which would block the task <br>
until it expired, or a non-blocking read which would return the number of days/hours/minutes/<br>
seconds/ticks until the next expiration, additional reads would return the next expiration after <br>
that, and so on.  A blocked task could be awaken from a read by an AST (asynchronous system <br>
trap, this was more RSX than Unix like).  You set the timer by writing to it (it was a binary <br>
structure that contained timer information).  Timers could be set using relative or absolute time, <br>
and could have single or repeating events, and you could have up to 8 events of any type queued <br>
up in a timer.  Each event structure also had a chain of completion and cancellation callbacks <br>
that could, in theory, be arbitrarily long.  Since it was an embedded system, we provided no real <br>
protection on these things, and if you scheduled a callback from your task and then terminated, <br>
the callback would still get called unless you cancelled it before termination.<br>
<p>
It was a very useful and somewhat nifty system for inter-task synchronization in a mostly <br>
asynchronous application (a high end video terminal).<br>
<p>
Anonymous timers were pretty much the same except that they were destroyed when your task <br>
exited and were not visible to other tasks.  We didn't have fork(), nor exec() as Unix/Linux has <br>
them, so nothing ever got inherited.  All the code on the system was always there (we ran out of <br>
ROM), and a task was just a thread of execution that was started with a system call.<br>
<p>
Anyway, thanks again for the response.<br>

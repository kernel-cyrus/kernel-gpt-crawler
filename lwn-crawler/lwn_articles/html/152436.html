<h1>A new approach to kernel timers</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
The kernel internal API includes a flexible mechanism for requesting that
events happen at some point in the future.  This timer subsystem is
relatively easy to work with and efficient, but it has always suffered from
a fundamental limitation: it is tied to the kernel clock interrupt, with
the result that the resolution of timers is limited to the clock interrupt
period.  For a 2.6.13 kernel, on the i386 architecture, using the default
clock interval, timers can be no more precise than 4ms.  For many
applications, that resolution is adequate, but some others (including real
time work and some desktop multimedia applications) require the ability to
sleep reliably for shorter periods.  Thus, a number of developers have
produced high-resolution timer patches over the years, but none of them
have been merged into the mainline.
<p>

Ingo Molnar's recently-released <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/152266/">2.6.13-rt6 tree</a>, which contains
the realtime preemption patch set, brought a surprise in the form of a new
high-resolution timer implementation by Thomas Gleixner.  Ingo has stated
his intention to merge this new code ("ktimers") upstream, so it merits a
look.
<p>

The ktimer implementation starts with the view that there are two
fundamentally different types of timers used in the system.  They are
(using the terms adopted by the patch):
<p>
<ul>

<li> <b>Timeouts</b>.  Timeouts are used primarily by networking and device
     drivers to detect when an event (I/O completion, for example) does not
     occur as expected.  They have low resolution requirements, and they
     are almost always removed before they actually expire.
<p>
<li> <b>Timers</b> are used to sequence ongoing events.  They can have high
     resolution requirements, and usually expire.
</ul>
<p>

The current kernel timer implementation is heavily oriented toward
timeouts.  To see how, consider the following diagram which, with
sufficient imagination, can be construed as a model of the data structure
used inside the kernel to manage timers:
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/Timers.png" width=612 height=496 border=0
alt="[Timer wheel diagram]">
</center>
<p>

At the right side of the diagram is an array (<tt>tv1</tt>) containing a
set of 256 (in most configurations) linked lists of upcoming timer events.
This array is indexed directly by the bottom bits of a
<tt>jiffies</tt> value to find the next set of events to execute.  When the
kernel has, over the course of 256 jiffies, cycled through the entire
<tt>tv1</tt> array, that array must be replenished with the next 256
jiffies worth of events.  That is done by using the next set of jiffies bits (six,
normally) to index into the next array (<tt>tv2</tt>), which points to
those 256 jiffies of timer entries.  Those entries are "cascaded" down to
<tt>tv1</tt> and distributed into the appropriate slots depending on their
expiration times.
When <tt>tv2</tt> is exhausted, it is
replenished from <tt>tv3</tt> in the same way.  This process continues up
to <tt>tv5</tt>.  The final entry in <tt>tv5</tt> is special, in that it
holds all of the far-future events which do not otherwise fit into this
hierarchy. 
<p>

This structure has some distinct advantages.  It can retrieve all of the
events to execute with a simple array lookup.  Insertion of events is
cheap, since their location in the structure is easy to calculate.
Importantly, the removal of events is also cheap; there is no need to
search through a long list of events to find a specific one to take out.
Since most timeouts are removed before they expire, quick removal is a
useful feature.
<p>

On the other hand, this data structure is firmly tied to <tt>jiffies</tt>
values, and cannot easily cope with timers with sub-<tt>jiffies</tt>
resolution.  The cascade process, which moves events from the higher arrays
to the lower ones, can be expensive if there are a lot of events to work
with.  Events which are removed prior to expiration will often not have to
be cascaded at all, while those which survive through to expiration will
have to work their way through the structure.  If the clock interrupt
frequency is raised (to get better timer resolution), these cascades will
happen more often, and the cost of the data structure goes up.

<p>
The ktimers patch makes no changes to the existing API or data structure,
which are deemed to 
be adequate and efficient for use with timeouts.  Instead, it adds an
entirely new API (and internal implementation) aimed at the needs of
high-resolution timers.  So ktimers are described entirely with human time
units - nanoseconds, in particular.  They are kept in a sorted, per-CPU
list, implemented as a red-black tree.  This structure provides for
relatively quick insertion or removal, though it will be slower than the
timeout structure shown above - but there is no need for the cascade
operation. 
<p>

The core structure for ktimers is, unsurprisingly,
<tt>struct&nbsp;ktimer</tt>.  They must be initialized before use with one
of the following functions:
<p>
<pre>
    void init_ktimer_mono(struct ktimer *timer);
    void init_ktimer_real(struct ktimer *timer);
</pre>
<p>
Internally, each ktimer is tied to a "base," being the clock by which it is
run.  The ktimer patch provides two such clocks.  The "monotonic" clock is
similar to <tt>jiffies</tt> in that it is a straightforward,
always-increasing count.  The "realtime" clock, instead, tries to match
time as known outside of the system; that clock can be corrected by the
kernel or by the system administrator.  A ktimer with a 5ms expiration
will, if initialized with <tt>init_ktimer_mono()</tt>, expire 5ms in the
future (with the usual proviso that delays can happen).  That same timer,
if initialized with <tt>init_ktimer_real()</tt>, will expire when the
realtime clock says that 5ms have passed.  But, since the realtime clock
may be adjusted in the meantime, the actual elapsed time could differ.
<p>
There are some caller-accessible fields in <tt>struct ktimer</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
    void (*function)(void *);
    void *data;
    nsec_t expired;
    nsec_t interval;
</pre>
<p>
When the timer expires, <tt>function()</tt> will be called with
<tt>data</tt> as its argument.  The <tt>expired</tt> field will contain the
time at which the timer actually expired, which might be later than
requested.  Interestingly, the high-resolution version of the ktimers patch
does not set this field.  Finally, <tt>interval</tt> is used for
periodic timers.
<p>
A timer is set with a call to:
<p>
<pre>
    int start_ktimer(struct ktimer *timer, nsec_t *time, int mode);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>time</tt> is the expiration time in nanoseconds, and
<tt>mode</tt> describes how 
that time is to be interpreted.  The possible <tt>mode</tt> values are:
<p>
<ul>

<li> <tt>KTIMER_ABS</tt>: the timer will expire at an absolute time.

<li> <tt>KTIMER_REL</tt>: the given <tt>time</tt> value is a relative time, 
     which must be added to the current time to get an absolute expiration
     time.

<li> <tt>KTIMER_INCR</tt>: for timers which have been used before, the
     <tt>time</tt> value is added to the previous expiration time.

<li> <tt>KTIMER_FORWARD</tt>: like <tt>KTIMER_INCR</tt>, except that the 
     <tt>time</tt> value will be added repeatedly, if necessary, to obtain
     an expiration time in the future.

<li> <tt>KTIMER_REARM</tt>: like <tt>KTIMER_FORWARD</tt>, except that the 
     <tt>interval</tt> value stored in the timer is added.

<li> <tt>KTIMER_RESTART</tt>: the expiration time of the timer is not
     changed at all.
</ul>
<p>

For <tt>KTIMER_FORWARD</tt> and <tt>KTIMER_REARM</tt>, the ktimer code also
maintains an integer <tt>overrun</tt> field in the ktimer structure.  If a
timer is started after the next expected expiration time (in other words,
the system fell behind and did not restart the timer soon enough),
<tt>overrun</tt> will be incremented to allow the calling code to
compensate.
<p>
The return value will be zero, unless the timer is already expired, in
which case the timer will <i>not</i> be started and the return value will
be negative.  If, however, the <tt>mode</tt> argument contains  the bit
<tt>KTIMER_NOCHECK</tt>, the timer will be started and executed normally,
regardless of whether it is already expired.
<p>

Most of the other ktimer functions are reasonably self-explanatory for
those who have seen the current timer API:
<p>
<pre>
    int modify_ktimer(struct ktimer *timer, nsec_t *time, int mode);
    int try_to_stop_ktimer(struct ktimer *timer);
    int stop_ktimer(struct ktimer *timer);
</pre>
<p>
There is also a convenience function to make a process sleep on a ktimer:
<p>
<pre>
    nsec_t schedule_ktimer(struct ktimer *timer, nsec_t *time, 
                           int state, int mode);
</pre>
<p>
The additional argument here (<tt>state</tt>) should be
<tt>TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE</tt> or <tt>TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE</tt>, depending on
whether the sleep should be interrupted by signals or not.  The return
value is the number of nanoseconds remaining in the requested sleep time;
it will be zero except when the sleep is ended prematurely.
<p>
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/152435/">standalone ktimers patch</a>
posted by Thomas is the version most likely to be merged.  This patch runs
ktimers from the normal clock interrupt, with the result that it provides
no better resolution than the existing timer API.  All of the structure is
there to do better, however, once the low-level timer code and architecture
specific support is in place.  A separate patch exists which enables
ktimers to provide high-resolution timers on the i386 architecture.
<p>
So far, the largest objection to the ktimer implementation is the use of
nanoseconds for time values.  Nanosecond timekeeping requires 64-bit
variables, which will slow things down a little on 32-bit systems.  The
response from the developers is that the additional overhead is almost zero
and not worth worrying about.  So, unless some other surprise turns up,
ktimers could find their way into the kernel not too long after 2.6.14
comes out.

      If I understand well, the changes described in the article only affect the kernel. I guess the applications don't use the kernel interface directly for timers, they use calls like nanosleep(2), so they can only use this interface if glibc is updated. I wonder how long does this whole process take, from implementing a kernel patch, to integrate it, patch glibc, upgrade the libc packages of the distributions. Maybe a followup article next year would be interesting.

      Actually, <tt>nanosleep()</tt> is a system call.  The ktimer patch includes a nanosleep reimplementation, so everything should be in place.  You'll need the extra, high-resolution bits (arch-specific timer code) to actually get nanosecond-resolution sleeps, of course.

      Same applies to itimers and all posix timer interfaces. Once the additional bits for high resolution timers are in place it will work out of the box with no changes to glibc and application code required.<br>

      Ironically I think there will be a handful of applications which assume the old, broken behaviour of nanosleep and will misbehave with the new nanosleep. Last time I checked nanosleep rounded the requested delay up to the next tick and then added another tick for good measure. Actually sleeping the requested amount will undoubtedly expose some application bugs.<br>

      Well given that the tick has changed from 10ms to 1ms to 4ms, I think that the buggy applications must already have been fixed..<br>

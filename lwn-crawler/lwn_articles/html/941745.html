           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>August 16, 2023</br>

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/941660/">call for topics</a> for the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/linux-kernel-maintainer-summit/">Linux
Kernel
Maintainers Summit</a> went out on August&nbsp;15; one proposed topic has
generated some interesting discussion about security-bug reporting for the
kernel. 
A recent <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4fee0915e649b">patch</a>
to the kernel's documentation about how to report security bugs recommends
avoiding posting to the <a
href="https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">linux-distros
mailing list</a> because its goals and rules do not mesh well with kernel
security practices.  That led Jiri Kosina to <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/nycvar.YFH.7.76.2308150927190.14207@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">suggest
a discussion on security reporting</a>, especially with regard to Linux
distributions. 
</p>

<p>
The linux-distros mailing list is a closed list for reporting security bugs
that affect Linux systems; as might be guessed, the participants are
representatives of various distributions.  It has some fairly stringent
requirements regarding the maximum embargo period&nbsp;(14 days) after a
bug is reported before it must be publicly disclosed; it also places
requirements 
on the reporter to post the full details to the <a
href="https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security">oss-security
mailing list</a> once the embargo has run its course.  These policies have
clashed with kernel bug reporting along the way.  Examples include a&nbsp;<a
href="/Articles/762512/">2018 embargo that went awry</a>, an <a
href="/Articles/874069/">even longer embargo botch</a> in 2021, and
a&nbsp;<a href="/Articles/896829/">2022 discussion of the problems</a>.
</p>

<p>
The core of the documentation patch from Greg Kroah-Hartman changes a
suggestion that some bugs 
might need to be coordinated with linux-distros to a strongly worded
admonition against doing so:
<blockquote class="bq">
The kernel security team strongly recommends that reporters of potential
security issues NEVER contact the "linux-distros" mailing list until
AFTER discussing it with the kernel security team.  Do not Cc: both
lists at once.  You may contact the linux-distros mailing list after a
fix has been agreed on and you fully understand the requirements that
doing so will impose on you and the kernel community.
<p>
The different lists have different goals and the linux-distros rules do
not contribute to actually fixing any potential security problems.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Kosina said that he generally agreed with the change, but wanted to discuss
how to 
report kernel security bugs to the distributions in some other fashion.  In
part, he was looking at the problem from the perspective of a distribution
maintainer for SUSE:
<blockquote class="bq">
With my distro hat on, I really want the kernel security bugs to be 
*eventually* processed through linux-distros@ somehow, for one sole 
reason: it means that our distro security people will be aware of it, 
track it internally, and keep an eye on the fix being ported to all of our 
codestreams. This is exactly how this is done for all other packages.
<p>
I would be curious to hear about this from other distros, but I sort of 
expect that they would agree.
<p>
If this process doesn't happen, many kernel security (with CVE potentially 
eventually assigned retroactively) fixes will go by unnoticed, as distro 
kernel people will never be explicitly made aware of them, and distros 
will be missing many of the patches. Which I don't think is a desired end 
effect.
</blockquote> 
</p>

<p>
Kosina noted that the advice from Kroah-Hartman is
that the distributions should simply follow one of the stable trees, but
that is unworkable for various reasons.  One concrete problem that SUSE has
is tracking whether a given CVE has been fixed in its kernel; even
though he believes that the CVE system is seriously flawed, tracking CVEs and
ensuring the fixes get into SUSE kernels is critical, especially for
certain kinds of customers.  The linux-distros list provided that tracking
in many cases "<q>and that is lost if the  fix goes only through
security@kernel.org</q>".
</p>

<p>
Vegard Nossum <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/658e739b-c164-c360-d6a3-eb4fb15ae02e@oracle.com/">agreed</a>
that the topic needed discussion and pointed to his <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230305220010.20895-1-vegard.nossum@oracle.com/">earlier
efforts to overhaul the security-reporting documentation</a>.  It would
make sense to discuss the issue at the summit in part because the recent
documentation change came about due to complaints from Linus Torvalds on
the closed lists, he said. "<q>I therefore think that Linus himself needs
to be involved in this discussion and that his arguments need to be made
in public instead of just paraphrased by me.</q>"  In part, Torvalds was unhappy
with requirements that proof-of-concept code exploiting a vulnerability has
to be published if the code was posted to linux-distros.
</p>

<h4>distros@kernel.org?</h4>

<p>
Nossum suggested having a closed list for distribution representatives that
was run by the kernel security team.  The list's policies and membership
could be set by the team and the list could be used to post
patches for security fixes once they are ready for the distributions to
incorporate them.  Kroah-Hartman was quick to <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/2023081515-lake-spotty-6a3a@gregkh/">throw cold
water on that idea</a>, however. 
</p> 

<p>
A list that pre-announces security problems will either be
"<q>deemed illegal in some countries</q>" or be required to admit all "major"
Linux users, which would include various government agencies across the
globe, he said.  For that reason, the Linux Foundation is not going to be
willing to 
host such a list and he suspects it would be hard to find an organization
willing 
to do so; "<q>it's amazing that linux-distros has been able to survive
for as long as it has</q>". 
</p>

<p>
Steven Rostedt <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20230815084253.7091083e@gandalf.local.home/">wondered</a>
if there were ways to solve Kosina's problem without running afoul of
concerns over pre-announcements.  He noted that the distribution kernels are
the ones that are in the hands of users, so it would be best to ensure that
the maintainers of those kernels have access to the information about
security flaws.  But Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/2023081540-vindicate-caterer-33c6@gregkh/">sees
the landscape rather differently</a>:
<blockquote class="bq">
The huge majority of Linux use in the world is Android, everything else
is a rounding error. Android does now have projects where security bugs
reported to them are required for the reporter to submit the problem to
security@k.o as well.  We fix the issue, get it pushed out, and the
reporter gets the credit. [...]
<p>
After Android, Debian is by far the largest Linux user, and the Debian
kernel developers do an awesome job of tracking the stable kernel
releases which have been documented to fix 99% of known security issues
_BEFORE_ they are known (data produced by Google security team for 2
years straight).
<p>
After that, the use of Linux tapers off to "roll your own kernel.org
releases" (still a huge number of absolute boxes thanks to many
government instances and corporate clouds) to the various "enterprise"
distros, down to the other community distros (Fedora/openSUSE/Arch/etc.)
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
He lamented the length of time it takes for Android to actually get these
fixes in the hands of its users&nbsp;(4-6 months), but praised the fact
that Android follows the 
stable releases.  He believes that governments are moving toward
regulations that will reduce those delays in any case.  The
distributions that are 
not following the stable kernels are generally those for enterprise Linux:
<blockquote class="bq">
It's that corporate sponsored "middle tier"
(which is still quite small overall) that likes complaining about this
stuff because they don't want to take the stable kernel updates for
various (in my opinion stupid) reasons.
<p>
So who would such a "distros@" list help?  Only that middle-tier, small
group of very well financed companies that want to go their own way with
their kernel releases because they want to.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Kosina <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/nycvar.YFH.7.76.2308160005300.14207@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">called
that an oversimplification</a>, noting that Android is huge in terms of
users, but that the customers for the enterprise distributions "<q>directly 
contribute back to kernel development, by allowing companies like Red Hat, 
SUSE, Canonical, ... to put kernel engineers on their payroll</q>".
Rostedt <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20230815183120.0c92a759@gandalf.local.home/">agreed</a>,
noting that the piecemeal impact of vulnerabilities in Android kernels is rather
different than that of such flaws for enterprise kernels: "<q>All it takes
is to go after one server, and 
you have access to thousands of users and their private data.</q>"
</>

<p>
Kroah-Hartman <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/2023081641-unstitch-kangaroo-a2c1@gregkh/">walked
back</a> his "rounding error" comment to a certain extent, but wanted to
focus on the "<q>false sense of security</q>" that comes from the enterprise
distributions picking and choosing fixes to apply to their kernels.  The
Linux community finds and fixes every bug that it can; it provides those
kernels to the world but they do not reach all users because of the
decisions made by certain companies. Meanwhile: "<q>those 'policy decisions of
companies' are now known by 
governments to be incorrect, and soon will be made illegal in many
countries, so we are on the right side here.</q>"
</p>

<h4>Working with linux-distros?</h4>

<p>
The linux-distros (and oss-security) mailing lists are administered and
moderated by Alexander "Solar Designer" Peslyak, who was alerted to the
discussion by Nossum.  Peslyak <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/20230816152621.GA8252@openwall.com/">posted</a> a
lengthy response, suggesting that interested people could perhaps meet at <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open
Source Summit Europe</a> since he would not be able to be present at the
Maintainers Summit.  He said that email discussion would work, perhaps
better in fact, "<q>but
meeting in person is a gesture that might help establish an atmosphere
of trust and assurance of good intent</q>". 
</p>

<p>
He pointed out that the new wording in the documentation does not
<i>preclude</i> posting to 
linux-distros, but says that it should happen only in consultation with the
kernel security team.  He does not know if that would actually happen, but:
"<q>Maybe some 
friendly dialogue and agreeing on things could affect that.</q>"  There
seem to be two problem areas: the linux-distros disclosure deadline
of&nbsp;14 days even if there is no fix yet and the requirement that any
proof-of-concept posted to the list be made public within seven days of the
vulnerability disclosure.  He agreed that both are problems and suggested
that a discussion on oss-security might lead to "<q>satisfactory
solutions/exceptions</q>". 
</p>

<p>
It seems clear that Kroah-Hartman, at least, does not see a real problem to
be solved.  As he <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/2023081512-worshiper-donor-371f@gregkh/">pointed
out</a>, though, the security team is "<q>run as
a 'collective' by those doing the work there, not by fiat</q>".  So perhaps
others will be inclined to see what can be worked out in order to keep
linux-distros in the loop, though it seems like an uphill battle.
</p>

<p>
As Peslyak noted, another summit topic post about <a
href="/ml/ksummit-discuss/ZNuuvS5BtmjcazIv@sashalap/">quality standards for
embargoed fixes</a> is also worth a look.  It would seem that some
interesting discussion topics are already lining up for the summit; look
for coverage of whichever topics get chosen, in November, shortly after the
event.

(Disclaimer: I work at SUSE)<br>
<p>
It is good that this is discussed, because this has been simmering for a long time. I see the 14 day requirement by distros as the major problem in the way it is currently run. I understand why solar designer insists on this (it is really tricky to keep information private for any extended time), but this then leads to people working around distros and distributing the information up front, only to notify distros when it's basically already solved and widely known. We (briefly) considered running an alternative, but as described in the article it's next to impossible for an international company to do that.<br>
<p>
As for Gregs main argument: While I can understand the frustration with the enterprise frankenkernels, it is exactly how Jiri describes it. These kernels are important to businesses for various reasons. They pay for that and this allows these companies to pay kernel developers. Have a look at the development statistics posted here regularly and sum it up, this is far from trivial.<br>

      <p>It <i>is</i> amazing that such pre-announcement security lists continue to exist.  For example, such inter-vendor secret collusion on product development requires an exemption from competition law, as administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. I've no doubt that the public interest is sufficent for such an exemption to be granted, but the simple fact is that an exemption hasn't been sought, and therefore any participating Australians are in a dodgy legal position. I imagine that many other countries have similar laws regulating participation in international cartel-like behaviour.</p>

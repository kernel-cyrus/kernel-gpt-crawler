<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 23, 2022</br>
           </div>
The kernel project tries hard to avoid duplicating functionality within its
code base; whenever possible, a single subsystem is made to serve all use
cases.  There is one notable exception to this rule, though: there are
three object-level memory allocators ("slab allocators") in the kernel.
The desire to reduce the count has been growing stronger over the years,
and some steps have been taken in 6.2 to eliminate the least-loved
allocator — SLOB — in the relatively near future.
<p>
The job of a slab allocator is to provide the kernel with (usually) small
chunks of memory in an efficient way.  The heavily used <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.1/source/include/linux/slab.h#L485"><tt>kmalloc()</tt></a> 
function is implemented by the slab allocator, but there is also a
lower-level API specialized for the management of numerous objects of the
same size.  It is quite common for a kernel subsystem to need to allocate
instances of a given structure, for example; all of those instances are
normally the same size and can be managed in a slab.
<p>
The kernel's oldest slab allocator is typically just called SLAB (though
the name is not an acronym); it has been there in
one form or another since nearly the beginning.  SLAB is intended to be a
general-purpose allocator suitable for most workloads, and serves
that purpose reasonably well.  Even so, developers have occasionally wished
for a different approach to object allocation; that led to the SLOB
allocator, which was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=10cef602950">added
in 2006</a> for the 2.6.16 kernel release; its purpose is to support the
smallest of systems where SLAB's memory use was seen as being too high:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	SLOB is a traditional K&amp;R/UNIX allocator with a SLAB emulation
    	layer, similar to the original Linux kmalloc allocator that SLAB
    	replaced.  It's significantly smaller code and is more memory
    	efficient.  But like all similar allocators, it scales poorly and
    	suffers from fragmentation more than SLAB, so it's only appropriate
    	for small systems.
</blockquote>
<p>
The third allocator, SLUB, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=81819f0fc82">followed</a>
for 2.6.22 in 2007.  SLUB, which was intended to eventually replace SLAB,
was a reaction to the perceived complexity and scalability problems in
SLAB; it had a strong focus on scalability and performance.  There have been
attempts to add other allocators — <a href="/Articles/311502/">SLQB in
2008</a> and <a href="/Articles/388296/">SLEB</a> in 2010, for example — but the
appetite for more allocators had mostly faded by then; Linus Torvalds <a
href="/Articles/389402/">made it clear</a> in 2010 that he would not accept any
more of them.  So, in 2022, the set of
mainline slab allocators remains SLAB, SLOB, and SLUB.
<p>
Since then, there has been occasional talk of removing at least one of the
existing slab allocators, but no real movement in that direction — until
Vlastimil Babka took up the issue this year.  In November, he <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/b35c3f82-f67b-2103-7d82-7a7ba7521439@suse.cz/">proposed</a>
deprecating SLOB as a step toward its eventual removal:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The unsurprising reasons include code maintenance burden, other
	features compatible with only a subset of allocators (or more
	effort spent on the features), blocking API improvements (more on
	that below), and my inability to pronounce SLAB and SLUB in a
	properly distinguishable way, without resorting to spelling out the
	letters.
</blockquote>
<p>
The API improvement mentioned there is adding the ability to use
<a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.1/source/mm/slab_common.c#L978"><tt>kfree()</tt></a>
on objects obtained from the lower-level slab functions 
(specifically <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.1/source/mm/slab.c#L3449"><tt>kmem_cache_alloc()</tt></a>);
the SLOB allocator's version of 
<tt>kfree()</tt> can only handle objects allocated with <tt>kmalloc()</tt>,
which complicates code elsewhere in the kernel.  This cost is maybe
justified if it brings other benefits, but Babka suggested that, in
fact, nobody is actually using SLOB.  The small devices it was aimed at (<a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20051101210617.GS4367@waste.org/">less
than 32MB of RAM</a>) don't exist in large numbers anymore, and even
distributions for small devices (such as OpenWrt) are not using it.
<p>
In the ensuing discussion, Paul Cercueil <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/K5M3LR.3O50LSSSY5L3@crapouillou.net/">described his
attempts</a> to use SLOB, concluding that it simply does not work properly.
Torvalds also <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjBqwJk9RgfoBuM00T49M7uQiLnOvLST7L6v5rhS7fkDA@mail.gmail.com/">recalled</a>
hearing about SLOB problems in recent times; Aaro Koskinen <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221109234832.GE307514@darkstar.musicnaut.iki.fi/">responded</a>,
though, that SLOB might just be exposing driver bugs that are hidden by the
other allocators.  In the end, though, SLOB had no real defenders; nobody
is advocating for keeping it in the kernel.
<p>
Still, one cannot just remove an allocator from the kernel without trying
to meet the needs of any existing users.  So Babka posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221121171202.22080-1-vbabka@suse.cz/">a 
patch set</a> that tried to minimize the impact on any SLOB users that may
remain.  It introduces a new <tt>SLUB_TINY</tt> configuration option that
removes many of the scalability and debugging features in an attempt to
make SLUB as small as possible.  SLUB will never be as small as SLOB but,
hopefully, it can be made small enough for what passes as a "small system"
in the 2020s.  The <tt>SLOB</tt> configuration option was then <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20221121171202.22080-13-vbabka@suse.cz/">renamed</a>
to <tt>SLOB_DEPRECATED</tt>, and it gained a warning that SLOB would be
removed "<q>in a few cycles</q>".  This patch series was merged for 6.2.
<p>
Unless a compelling case for the retention of SLOB comes up over the course
of the next year, the removal of that allocator seems nearly certain.  Then
Linux will be down to just two allocators, both of which claim to handle
the general case.
<p>
Babka has made it clear that he sees two as still being too many; the
removal of SLAB is sure to come up once the SLOB removal is complete.
Getting rid of SLAB will not be quite so easy, though, since SLAB still has
active users.  Notably, Google is said to be using SLAB internally.  It
seems that SLUB is still worse for some use cases; as long as that
situation persists, removing SLAB will be hard.  This problem is
complicated by a lack of general understanding of just where and why SLUB
falls down.
<p>
Getting a handle on that situation may take some time, so the kernel is
likely to continue to have two slab allocators for some time yet.  But even
the removal of SLOB will make life easier in a number of ways. It can seem
like code added to the kernel is there forever, but it is,
sometimes, possible to get rid of old subsystems with enough patience and
effort.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

The slab allocator, as the article says, has been there almost since the beginning.  In those days 32 megabytes of RAM was a lot.  Linux commonly ran on PCs with eight megs or less.  What has changed to make the slab allocator no longer suitable for these small systems?  And can it be partially undone by adding new tuning knobs to the allocator?<br>

The last time I checked a stock distribution kernel required around 50 MBytes of RAM to boot. For today's standards where we measure the amount of RAM of mobile phones in GBytes this is tiny.<br>
<p>
I think that this "high" memory requirement is mostly due to speed optimizations in the kernel (and allocator). So the mentioned SLUB_TINY option might just do the trick in removing/reducing most of these default allocations.<br>
<p>
I remember vaguely that someone gave a talk not too long ago presenting a modified Linux kernel that required less than a MByte to boot.<br>

Last I heard, the minimum requirement for the *stock* kernel to boot (admittedly, config options pared down to a minimum) was 6MB.<br>
<p>
And it was pointed out that your typical distro installer needed more than that ...<br>
<p>
It's all the stuff on top of the kernel that is responsible for demanding all that ram.<br>

For reference, OpenWRT, the most common linux distribution for constrained devices, has all but dropped support for 32/4 (MB of Flash/RAM) devices: <a href="https://openwrt.org/supported_devices/432_warning">https://openwrt.org/supported_devices/432_warning</a>, with 64/8 being declared passable and 128/16 useful. So that appears to be the practical limit.<br>
<p>
There's still devices that fall below this range of course, but I personally think that even if it could be done, it doesn't makes much sense to support them in linux today in the first place. There's a real cost to every order of magnitude of memory you support, and they usually run some custom RTOS out of the box anyway, which they are probably much better served by.<br>

It's not the same allocator anymore. As the article notes:<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; SLOB is a traditional K&amp;R/UNIX allocator with a SLAB emulation layer, similar to the original Linux kmalloc allocator that SLAB replaced.</span><br>

Yes it was, SLAB replaced the original kmalloc() around 2.1.something (and the original slab per Bonwick94 replaced the original, more traditional SunOS malloc).<br>

      <p>Linux 2.2 was released in 1999. Windows 2000 system requirements of 32MB were considered crazy heavy and that's why Windows 98 survived for quite some time after that</p>

<p>It's possible that Linux 2.2 wasn't supporting 4MB well, but it definitely worked on that amount of RAM. And 16MB was usable with GUI (even if slow).</p>

<p>64MB is something called “recommended minimum” while 32MB if “the minimum supported”. And yes, it was possible to use it with 32MB… but that was too much, that's why PC makers forced Microsoft to release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Me">Windows ME</a> which also, officially, needed 32MB, but it was actually possible to use it with 32MB.</p>

You are comparing two lines of Windows system. Win2000 was a continuation of NT4, while 95, 98, ME were consumer line of Windows. They were separate, concurrent lines, which eventually converged into Windows XP.<br>

      <p>True, but irrelevant. We are discussing system requirements here. Formally Windows 2000 and Windows ME had the same 32MB minimum memory requirement, but in practice Windows 2000 with 32MB was barely usable while Windows ME was adequate.</p>

Indeed, I messed up. If one boots the installer CD with insufficient RAM, it will clearly display an error screen, with 32 MB as the stated requirement.<br>

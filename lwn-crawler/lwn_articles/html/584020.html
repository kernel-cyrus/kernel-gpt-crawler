<p>
So far, the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/">x32 ABI</a>—a
32-bit ABI for running on x86 processors in 64-bit mode—is
not widely used.  Only a few distributions have enabled support for it in
their kernels (notably Ubuntu), which reduces the impact of a recently
discovered local privilege
escalation somewhat, but the bug has been in the kernel since 2012.  It's a nasty
hole, that required a <a href="/Articles/583659/">quick fix</a> for Ubuntu
13.10 (and two hardware enablement kernels for 12.04 LTS: <a
href="/Alerts/583662/">linux-lts-raring</a> and <a href="/Alerts/583663/">linux-lts-saucy</a>).
</p>

<p>
It is the x32 version of <tt>recvmmsg()</tt> that has the bug.  In the
<tt>compat_sys_recvmmsg()</tt> function that is part of the compatibility
shim for handling multiple ABIs in the kernel, a user-space pointer for the
<tt>timeout</tt> value is treated as a kernel pointer (rather than copied
using <tt>copy_from_user()</tt>) for the x32 ABI. The value of the
<tt>timeout</tt> 
pointer is 
controlled by the user, but it gets passed as a kernel pointer that
<tt>__sys_recvmmsg()</tt> (which implements the system call) will use.  The
kernel will dereference the pointer 
for both reading and writing, which allows a local, unprivileged user to
get root privileges.
</p>

<p>
The problem was reported to the closed security@kernel.org and <a
href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">linux-distros</a>
mailing lists on January 28 by Kees Cook, after "PaX Team" reported it to the
Chrome OS bug tracker (in a still-restricted entry).  It was embargoed for
two days to give distributions time to get fixes out.  After that, "Solar
Designer" <a href="/Articles/584169/">reported</a> it publicly since Cook was traveling.  It is
a serious bug, but is somewhat mitigated by the fact that <a href="/Articles/548838/">few distributions</a>
have actually enabled the ABI.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/Articles/456731/">x32 ABI</a> came about largely to combat
the amount of memory wasted on x86_64 processors for 64-bit pointers (and
long integers) in
programs that did not require the extra 32 bits for each value.  It
allows programs to use the extra registers and other advantages that come
with x86_64 without 
paying the penalty of extra memory usage.  In theory, that should lead to
less memory usage and faster programs due to a smaller cache footprint.  So
far, though, those benefits  are somewhat speculative—and controversial.
</p>

<p>
X32 does exist in the kernel, however, and can be enabled with the
<tt>CONFIG_X86_X32</tt> flag.  If it is enabled, any user can
build an x32 program using GCC with the <tt>-mx32</tt> flag.  The kernel
will recognize such a binary and handle it appropriately.
</p>

<p>
The bug was introduced in a February 2012 <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/compat.c?id=ee4fa23c4bfcc635d077a9633d405610de45bc70">commit</a>
that was adding support for 64-bit <tt>time_t</tt> values to x32.  The
problematic code is as follows (from <tt>compat_sys_recvmmsg()</tt>):
<pre>
    if (COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME)
            return __sys_recvmmsg(fd, (struct mmsghdr __user *)mmsg, vlen,
                                  flags | MSG_CMSG_COMPAT,
                                  (struct timespec *) timeout);
</pre>
The <tt>timeout</tt> value is passed to that function as:
<pre>
    struct compat_timespec __user *timeout
</pre>
It is clearly annotated as a user-space pointer, but just gets
passed to <tt>__sys_recvmmsg()</tt>.  The <a
href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/compat.c?id=2def2ef2ae5f3990aabdbe8a755911902707d268">fix</a>
is to use <tt>compat_get_timespec()</tt> to copy the data from user space
before the call to <tt>__sys_recvmmsg()</tt> and
<tt>compat_put_timespec()</tt> to copy any changes back to user space
afterward. 
</p>

<p>
Exploits have started to appear (for example, <a
href="http://pastebin.com/DH3Lbg54">one by rebel</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/saelo/cve-2014-0038">another by saelo</a>).  The
basic idea is to use the fact that <tt>recvmmsg()</tt> will write the
amount of time left in the timeout to the location specified by the
<tt>timeout</tt> pointer. 
Since the value of that pointer is controlled by the user, it can be arranged to write known
values (another exploit-controlled address, say) to somewhere
"interesting", for example to a function pointer that gets called when the
<tt>/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn</tt> file is opened (as rebel's exploit does).
The program will already have arranged to have "interesting" code (to gain
root privileges) located at that address.  When the function is called by
the kernel via that pointer, the exploit's code is run.
</p>

<p>
Users of Ubuntu 13.04 should note that it reached its <a
href="/Articles/583236/">end of life</a> two days before the bug was found,
so no update for that kernel has been issued.  One possible solution for
those who have not yet upgraded to 13.10 (or are running some other
distribution kernel and do not want to patch and build their kernel) is a
<a href="/Articles/584198/">module</a> that disables the x32 version of the
<tt>recvmmsg()</tt> system call.

<p>
As PaX Team noted in the report (quoted by Solar Designer), the presence of
this bug certainly calls into question how much testing (fuzz testing in
particular) has been done on the x32 ABI.  For a bug of that nature to
exist in the kernel for two years would also seem to indicate that it isn't
just testing that has fallen by the wayside—heavy use would also seem to be
precluded.  In any case, the problem was found, reported, and fixed, now it
is up to users (and any distributions beyond Ubuntu since we have received no
other security advisories beyond those mentioned above) to update their kernels.

The very last line in that text splatch is the security vulnerability.  It is frustrating because it's hard to see when there are so many other bogus warnings.  Some of the warnings seem tricky to fix but others are just a matter of adding the correct Sparse annotations.<br>
<p>
Fengguang Wu created his automated build notification system in June 2012 but this patch was applied the previous February.  These days the patch would have generated an automated response.  I can't promise that it would have been fixed but hopefully.<br>

      and this is what it looks like from my checker plugin (after fixing up some usage of __user on non-ptr types, etc that make it incompatible with the address space concept):
<pre>
linux-3.13.1/net/compat.c: In function 'compat_sys_recvmmsg':
linux-3.13.1/net/compat.c:786:35: warning: cast to generic address space pointer from disjoint __user address space pointer [enabled by default]

my advice: right tool for the right job ;)

      i don't know all the address space rules off the top of my head but my best guess is that gcc is being generous here by providing at least a warning despite the explicit type cast (that converts the pointer to an incompatible address space), without a cast it gives the expected error:
<pre>
linux-3.13.1/net/compat.c:786:35: error: passing argument 5 of '__sys_recvmmsg' from pointer to non-enclosed address space
                                   timeout);
                                   ^

frankly, given the hack i needed to get this to work at all (IIRC, address space support is in C99 while the kernel's compiled in gnu89 mode) i'm glad it works as well as it does ;). the only reason i can't enable it unconditionally is because the kernel isn't thoroughly annotated unfortunately.

Re-compiled my "perf_fuzzer" tool for x32 and ran it and it's turning up all kinds of bugs :(  And my fuzzer is just exercising a handful of syscalls.  Time to send some messages to lkml.  My poor fuzzing machine never catches a break.<br>

Do you have pointers on how to run your fuzzer? These kinds of bugs are down my alley of things I like to fix in projects I use.<br>

On further testing on x32 I get one WARN message that looks scary, a reboot-without logging anything issue, and then I run into the 2 or 3 crash-the-machine-with-useless-messages bugs you also find on regular x86 systems.<br>
<p>
Sadly none of the bugs are deterministic.  So while the fuzzer quickly hits them within minutes, it is really hard to get kernel devs to look an them without at easy reproducer or a good kernel backtrace log.<br>
<p>
If you want to try out the fuzzer, you can download the perf_event_test<br>
suite from here: <a href="https://github.com/deater/perf_event_tests">https://github.com/deater/perf_event_tests</a><br>
enter the fuzzer dir, run "make" then "./perf_fuzzer" and away you go.<br>
To get x32 support you have to hack the makefiles to add -mx32 and link statically (for some reason the dynamic x32 libraries provided by debian don't work for me).<br>
<p>
My fuzzer mostly concentrates on fuzzing the perf_event interface though.  If you want to do more generic kernel fuzzing you should try out trinity (and in fact my fuzzer shares some code with trinity).<br>

Minor point: while I haven't tested it myself, I doubt that GCC's compilers need to be run on an x32-enabled kernel in order to support the -mx32 architecture option and produce x32-compatible binaries. The sentence that talks about -mx32 shouldn't link those two actions together, as they are independent.<br>

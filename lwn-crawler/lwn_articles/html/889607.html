<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 18, 2022</br>
           </div>
The ftrace and perf subsystems provide visibility into the workings of the
kernel; by activating existing tracepoints, interested developers can see
what is happening at specific points in the code.  As much as kernel
developers may resist the notion, though, not all events of interest on a
system happen within the kernel. Administrators will often want to look
inside user-space processes as well; they would be even happier with a
mechanism that allows the simultaneous tracing of events in both the kernel
and user space.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220118204326.2169-1-beaub@linux.microsoft.com/">user-events
subsystem</a>, developed by Beau Belgrave and added
during the 5.18 merge window, 
promises that capability, but users will almost certainly have to wait
another cycle to gain access to it.
<p>
Kernel tracepoints are hooks at specific locations in the code.  They are
designed to add as little overhead as possible when they are not active,
which is the case most of the time.  When a tracepoint is activated, it
produces a stream of structured data specific to the event being monitored;
user space can read that data via a number of different interfaces.  By
turning on just the tracepoints of interest, user space can collect the
data needed to analyze a specific situation without slowing down the kernel
overall.
<p>
<h4>The user-events ABI</h4>
<p>
Belgrave's user-space equivalent to kernel-space tracepoints, merged for 5.18,
requires a bit more work to
support, though libraries provided in the future may ease some of that
burden.  The first step is to open a new file added to the tracefs kernel
filesystem:
<p>
<pre>
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/user_events_data
</pre>
<p>
A program then needs to register each event that it wishes to make
available to the system.  That is done by filling out this structure:
<p>
<pre>
    struct user_reg {
        u32 size;
        u64 name_args;
        u32 status_index;
        u32 write_index;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The first two members are input parameters, while the last two are set by
the kernel.  The <tt>size</tt> parameter should just be the size of the
<tt>user_reg</tt> structure itself; this helps to ensure compatibility if
the structure grows in future kernel releases.  The event itself is
described by <tt>name_args</tt>, which is a pointer to a string; it uses a
special format added with this patch set.  The first
token is the name of the event; the rest of the line describes the data
reported for that event.  So an event that reports an integer named
<tt>level</tt> and a 20-character string named <tt>badness</tt> could be
described as: 
<p>
<pre>
   my-event u32 level; char[20] badness
</pre>
<p>
This structure is then registered with an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>
operation on the previously opened <tt>user_events_data</tt> file,
using the <tt>DIAG_IOCSREG</tt> command.  On successful registration, the
kernel will store two index values in <tt>status_index</tt> and
<tt>write_index</tt>, the use of which will be described below.
<p>
Once the event is registered, it will show up in tracefs under the
<tt>user_events</tt> subsystem.  That means it can be activated, and its
data collected, using any of the usual user-space tools.  But to get there,
the application must still provide that data when the time comes.
<p>
To do that, the program should open the other new tracefs file as well:
<p>
<pre>
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/user_events_status
</pre>
<p>
That file should then be mapped into the program's address space with an <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><tt>mmap()</tt></a>
call.
<p>
Like its kernel counterpart, the user-events mechanism has been designed to
minimize its overhead when nobody is interested in the events.  So the
program implementing the events will only want to provide the data if it
has been requested.  The <tt>user_events_status</tt> file that was just mapped
above will contain a byte of data indicating whether the event is active or
not; its index will be the value stored in the <tt>status_index</tt> field
during registration.  If that byte is zero, the event is not active and the
program should not output any data; that is expected to be the case most of
the time.
<p>
When somebody attaches to the event, the associated byte will no longer
read as zero.  It is, in fact, a bitmap giving information about how the
event has been attached; one bit corresponds to ftrace, while another is
for perf.  When the program sees that non-zero byte, it should write the
data associated with the event to the <tt>user_events_data</tt> file opened
at the beginning.  The first four bytes of the written data should be the
value the kernel stored in <tt>write_index</tt> at registration time; the
rest will be the data as described.  Typically, a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readv.2.html"><tt>writev()</tt></a>
call will be needed to assemble the requisite bits.
<p>
That describes the bulk of the API.  More information can be found in <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/864ea0e10cc9">this documentation
commit</a> and <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c57eb4781509">this
sample program</a>.  There is also, inevitably, a way to attach BPF
programs to user events, but that feature is not described in detail in the
documents. 
<p>
<h4>Concerns</h4>
<p>
After this code was merged, <a href="https://lttng.org">Linux Trace
Toolkit</a> (LTTng) developer Mathieu Desnoyers posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/2059213643.196683.1648499088753.JavaMail.zimbra@efficios.com/">some
criticisms</a> of the new interface.  The byte-based status mechanism
struck him as inefficient; providing a single bit for each event would
allow for a more compact representation and, thus, better cache
utilization.  The multiple bits of information indicating how the events
had been attached to have no real value to the application being traced,
which should produce the same data regardless.
<p>
He had some other concerns as well.  If the page(s) containing the data to
be written for an event are forced out of memory, the resulting page fault
will cause <tt>writev()</tt> to fail and, absent active countermeasures, the
event data will be lost.  The mechanism as a whole is built around access
to tracing data
via the kernel; it will only add overhead when purely user-space
tracers (such as LTTng) are in use.  There were a number of implementation
concerns as well.
<p>
Desnoyers also brought the facility to the attention of BPF maintainer
Alexei Starovoitov, who had been unaware of it.  He <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAADnVQK=GCuhTHz=iwv0r7Y37gYvt_UBzkfFJmNT+uR0z+7Myw@mail.gmail.com/">was
not happy</a> with what he saw; he called for the BPF mechanism to be
removed immediately: "<q>It's a hard Nack to add a bpf interface to
user_events</q>".  He has reiterated that position in subsequent
discussions. 
<p>
Belgrave quickly <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220329173051.10087-1-beaub@linux.microsoft.com/">posted
a patch</a> removing the BPF feature, as requested.  But it looks like that
will not be enough for this feature to be enabled in 5.18.  Tracing
maintainer Steven Rostedt <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220329154532.4833d16d@gandalf.local.home/">stated
his agreement</a> with Desnoyers, saying that he is considering <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220329222514.51af6c07@gandalf.local.home/">marking
the whole mechanism as "broken"</a> so that the issues can be resolved.  It is
conceivable that Belgrave could address all of the concerns in this
development cycle, but it is unlikely; that sort of work is not meant to go
into the mainline after the merge window closes.  So, chances are, users
will have to wait until 5.19 for access to the new user-events tracing
mechanism.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      It seems to me that the proposed mechanism is expensive when an event is actually monitored: one writev() system call per event.  This will limit the uptake even if it gets accepted.

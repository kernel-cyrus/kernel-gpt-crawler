The <tt>net/</tt> directory tree in the Linux kernel source is an
intimidating place.  We all use the kernel's networking features, but even
experienced kernel hackers often hesitate to wander into the code which
implements those features.  To many, the networking stack is a black box,
maintained by a distinct set of developers who keep many of their secrets to
themselves.  There is little documentation on how Linux networking is
implemented, adding to the challenge of understanding how it all works.
<p>

<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/ulni_cover.jpg" width=92 height=120 alt="[Cover]"
align="right" hspace=2>

Your editor had been told that O'Reilly had a book on the networking stack
- a sort of companion to <i>Understanding The Linux Kernel</i> - in the
works.  But it was still a nice surprise to see the end result - a book by Christian Benvenuti
entitled <i>Understanding Linux Network Internals</i> - show up on the
doorstep.  A couple of weeks later, after having read much of the book,
your editor is ready to share some comments.  The short version would be: this
book is a welcome addition to the (short) list of books about the kernel.
It is not as good a book as it could have been, however, and leaves some
significant gaps.
<p>

Let's get one pet peeve out of the way immediately: any kernel book
should disclose, on the cover, which version of the kernel is
covered.  As LWN readers know well, things change quickly in the kernel.  A
book which covers one version will likely be obsolete in many places a few
versions later.  If a kernel book does not include version information,
there is no way to know which reality it matches or whether it will be even
remotely relevant to current kernels.
<p>

In the case of this book, there is no word anywhere regarding which version
is covered.  It is clearly a 2.6 book, but that is all we know.  Your
editor has come to the conclusion from his reading that the book was a long
time in the writing (not surprising: the subject matter is complex, and the
book is over 1,000 pages long), and that, if an effort was made to make it
consistently current for a specific kernel version, that effort was
incomplete.  The section on interrupts, for example, presents the old
prototype for interrupt handlers last seen in the 2.5.68 kernel.  Other
parts are much more current.  The book is a bit of a patchwork in that
regard.
<p>

And in other regards as well.  Some parts of the book seem to want to be a
programming manual - to the point that the slab cache functions
(<tt>kmem_cache_create()</tt> and friends) are presented on page&nbsp;4.
Page&nbsp;13 talks about the <tt>likely()</tt> and <tt>unlikely()</tt>
constructs.  Yet, in other areas, detail is much more scarce, and there is
no complete discussion of how to write code for the kernel.  And (another
pet peeve of your editor's) the issues of concurrency and race conditions
are passed over almost completely.
<p>

Similarly, the section on network device drivers offers a great deal of information on
device registration, queueing discipline bits, notifiers, power management,
ethtool, dealing with the PCI bus, module initialization, and more.  There
is even a section on how bottom halves worked in the 2.2 kernel.  But there
is almost no information on how to write transmit and receive functions.
At one point the author writes "This chapter does not strive to be a
guide on how to write NIC device drivers."  No problem, there are
(ahem) other books which cover that ground.  But then why bother with
things like PCI device registration?

<p>

This book does contain a great deal of information.  It may pass over
driver transmit and receive functions, but it does cover packet
transmission and reception in the higher levels of the networking stack in
some detail - and that is just what one would want.  There is a long
section on IPv4 and ICMP, and quite a bit of information on the complicated
"neighbor" code (the ARP protocol and such).  The last major section is on
routing.  Stuffed into the middle is a 110-page section on the bridging
subsystem.
<p>

Networking is a large area, and a large part of the kernel, so it is hard
to cover everything even in a 1000-page book.  So some important things
were left out of <i>Understanding Linux Network Internals</i>.  These
include TCP, IPv6, IPsec, netfilter, traffic control, and several other
topics.  And that leads to your editor's last, and perhaps biggest
complaint.  The inconsistent focus and somewhat irregular choice of topics
seen at the lower levels is also present in the large scale.  Your editor
would have happily traded the four chapters on bridging for a solid
overview of how the TCP protocol works in Linux, and your editor suspects
that he is not alone.  Netfilter and traffic control, perhaps, merit a book
of their own, but maybe some of the other chapters could have been
tightened up enough to make room for an introduction to IPv6 or IPsec.  
<p>

So it is hard to recommend this book in an unreserved fashion.  That said,
there is a great deal of useful information to be found in <i>Understanding
Linux Network Internals</i>, and your editor is glad to have it on his
bookshelf.  It has already come in useful a couple of times while trying to
figure out how parts of networking-related patches work.  So this book is a
welcome addition to the body of kernel-related documentation, even if it is
not everything one might wish it would be.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      Thanks for the review. Mentioning the author's name (Christian Benvenuti) and a link to the book's page @oreilly (<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/understandlni/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/understandlni/</a>) wouldn't hurt, IMHO...<br>

      Leaving out the author's name was a silly mistake, not quite sure how I managed that.  Fixed now...

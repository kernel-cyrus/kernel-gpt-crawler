Race conditions can be some of the trickiest bugs to find.  The resulting
problems can be subtle, and reproducing the problem in order to track it
down can be difficult or impossible; often code inserted to narrow down a
race condition will cause it to stop manifesting entirely.  A tool that can
find race conditions automatically would thus be a valuable thing for the
kernel community to have.  In late September, Marco Elver <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CANpmjNPJ_bHjfLZCAPV23AXFfiPiyXXqqu72n6TgWzb2Gnu1eA@mail.gmail.com/">announced
a tool called KCSAN</a> (the Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer) that does
exactly that — and which has already found a number of real problems.
<p>
A common cause of race conditions is unserialized access to shared data
leading to inconsistent views of the state of the world.  Such problems can
be hard to identify with code inspection, since they involve the
interaction of multiple sites within the code itself and generally require
a rare type of bad timing.  But an automated
tool might be able to note when this kind of access happens and flag a
problem even if the system manages not to misbehave as a result.  KCSAN
finds potential problems by monitoring access to memory locations and
identifying patterns where:
<p>
<ul>
<li> multiple threads of execution access the location,
<li> those accesses are unordered — not protected by a lock, for example,
     and,
<li> at least one of those accesses is a write.
</ul>
<p>
Needless to say, watching every memory location that the kernel accesses
would be a massive task, so KCSAN takes a statistical approach in the hope
of stumbling across problems eventually.
<p>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>
The first step is to compile the kernel with the <tt>-fsanitize=thread</tt>
option, which is supported by both GCC and Clang.  This will cause the
compiled code to be instrumented to allow the monitoring of its memory
accesses.  Specifically, each memory access will be augmented by a
function call; if the program reads a four-byte quantity at <tt>addr</tt>,
for example,
the generated code will first make a call to <tt>__tsan_read4(addr)</tt>.
The monitoring code provides these <tt>__tsan_readN()</tt> and
<tt>__tsan_writeN()</tt> functions, which can then do something useful with
the access pattern it sees.
<p>
In the case of KCSAN, these function calls are simply ignored 1,999 out of
2,000 times; to do otherwise would slow the kernel to a point of complete
unusability.  On the 2,000th time, though, KCSAN keeps an eye on the
address for a period of time, looking for other accesses.  While running in
 the context of the thread where the access was performed, KCSAN will set
a "watchpoint", which is done by recording the address, the size of the
data access, and whether the access was a write in a small table.  This
thread will then simply delay for (by default) 10µs.
<p>
The above picture is simplified somewhat; there are a couple of exceptions
to keep in mind.  The first of those is that, before deciding whether to
ignore an access, KCSAN looks to see if there is already a watchpoint
established for the address in question.  If so, and if either the current
access or the access that created the watchpoint is a write, then a race
condition has been detected and a report will be sent to the system log.
<p>
In the
absence of a watch point, the code will check whether the current access is
being performed in an atomic context (using KCSAN's definition, which is a
bit different than what the rest of the kernel uses) before deciding
whether to ignore the access or not.  An atomic access, thus, will not
result in the creation of a watch point, but if one already exists then the
code is accessing the data location in question in both atomic and
non-atomic ways, which rarely leads to good things.
<p>
Meanwhile, the original thread is delaying after having set the
watchpoint.  At the end of the delay period, the watchpoint will be
deleted and monitoring of that address stops.  But before execution
continues, the value at the accessed address 
will be checked; if it has changed since the watchpoint was set, a race
condition is once again deemed to have occurred.
<p>
Naturally, the above story leaves out some details, but that is the core of
the algorithm used.  One would expect it to miss a lot of races, since it
is only looking at a fraction of the kernel's memory accesses and only
watches any given location for a short period of time.  But, if run for
long enough, KCSAN does indeed appear to be able to find race conditions
that have escaped the developers of the code in question.
<p>
<h4>KCSAN in action</h4>
<p>
The syzbot system has started adding KCSAN to its fuzzing runs, resulting
in some immediate bug reports.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/0000000000009b403005942237bf@google.com/">first of
those</a> was in the kernel's "taskstats" subsystem; that resulted in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191009114809.8643-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/">a
fix</a> from Christian Brauner that has not yet made it into the mainline.
After five revisions, though, chances are that it should be close
to being ready.
<p>
Few parts of the kernel have been more closely scrutinized for concurrency
issues than the read-copy-update (RCU) subsystem, which is itself a
concurrency-management mechanism.  On October&nbsp;7, KCSAN <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/000000000000604e8905944f211f@google.com/">found a
data race in RCU</a>; various patches have been circulated to fix it but,
once again, nothing has found its way to the mainline yet.
<p>
As might be expected, KCSAN also produces warnings in situations that are
not actual race conditions.  Silencing those warnings requires annotating
the code, often by marking the accesses in question with
<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> or <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>.  Some developers have
already raised concerns that KCSAN reports will lead to a flurry of "fixes"
from developers who may not fully understand the code they are working
with.  Even false positives can have their value, though; while <a
href="/ml/netdev/20191011031746.16220-1-edumazet@google.com/">addressing
some reports in the TCP code</a>, Eric Dumazet discovered and fixed a real
race that 
was added with the <a href="/Articles/508865/">TCP fast open</a> mechanism
in 2012.
<p>
KCSAN is a new tool that still has some rough edges to it.  Some time will
be required to smooth those down and for the development community as a
whole to figure out how to integrate its reports into the development
process.  There is clear value, though, in a tool that can find this kind
of obscure problem; it should lead to more reliable kernels in the future.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

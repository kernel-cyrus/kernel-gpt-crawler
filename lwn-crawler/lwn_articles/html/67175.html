<h1>Shrinking the kernel with gcc</h1>
<div class="Byline">[Posted January 21, 2004 by corbet]
               <p>

<div class="ArticleText">
It will come as no surprise to most Linux users that the kernel has grown
over time.  In general, the expansion in the kernel has been more than
offset by the increasing power of the systems that it runs on, but there is
still a price to be paid for kernel bloat.  Extra memory has to be paid
for, and other overhead - such as cache misses - can hurt the overall
performance of the system.
<p>
Andi Kleen has been putting some effort into making the kernel smaller
through the use of some relatively new and obscure gcc options.  He starts
with <tt>-Os</tt>, as do most kernel shrinkers; this one simply tells the
compiler to optimize for size rather than strictly for performance.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that <tt>-Os</tt> not only produces a smaller
kernel, but the resulting code also often runs faster as well.  
<p>
The next step was to <a href="/Articles/67176/">use
<tt>-funit-at-a-time</tt></a>.  This option is new; it will be part of the
upcoming gcc&nbsp;3.4 release.  It causes the compiler to load the entire
source file into memory before it begins generating code; the result is
better inlining and dropping of unused functions.  The result was a little
over 3% reduction in kernel text size.  The reasons for this shrinkage require
further investigation; it may be that there is a significant amount of dead
code in the kernel.
<p>
Finally, Andi has also <a href="/Articles/66965/">enabled
<tt>-mregparm=3</tt></a>, which instructs the compiler to pass up to three
function arguments in registers, rather than on the stack.  This option
helps even more than <tt>-funit-at-a-time</tt>.  Using all three options,
Andi is able to reduce the text size by over 700KB.
<p>
There is one potential problem with <tt>-mregparm=3</tt>, however: it
changes the calling conventions within the kernel, and thus breaks binary
modules.  As one might imagine, some kernel developers are more worried
about this than others.  Red Hat kernel packager Arjan van de Ven has <a
href="/Articles/67179/">stated</a> that he is using this option, and
intends to build production kernels that way as well.  As always, sympathy
for the difficulties encountered by distributors of binary-only modules is
low.  If the kernel hackers decide that this option is worth using, they'll
not let some broken binary modules stop them.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I am not a kernel developer, so feel free to write me off as a blowhard and ignore what I say.<p>I think that it might be a good *goal* to break binary-only drivers, never mind a side effect.  We're in an alarming state right now where Linux has become big enough that companies like nVidia can ship binary-only drivers and claim that they support Linux.  (Which, I suppose they do, but they're not supporting open standards or open-source software.)  If people figured out that their hardware wasn't going to work with updated kernels every six months or so, there might be real pressure on hardware manufacturers to at least allow people to write open-source drivers.  As it is right now, using the binary drivers is &quot;too easy&quot;, and many opt to just do that rather than support those companies who allow programming information out.  The result is that there is no incentive for manufacturers to play nice; they quiet most of the complaints by shipping a binary-only driver.<p>-Rob

      Hey there!<p>I'm by no means a kernel developer either, but I do believe the effects of such a fundamental change to the kernel is very important. I am a developer by day and by night, I also spend a hell of a lot of time supporting very cutting-edge uses of Linux in IT.<p>This is the sort of crap that gives Linux a bad name.<p>Why do we need this change? I mean, really. I can see uses for it in the embedded sector, but in the real world (read: the world where the average server comes equipped with 2gb RAM) this has very little benefit.<p>I am fully aware of the potential correlation between size and performance, but I remain unconvinced that any more than 0.001% of the real world users of Linux would find this change enabling, or even useful. I think it will find the most popular acceptance among nerds who spend day and night trying to squeeze just that last 1kb of free memory.<p>This change is the sort of thing geeks masterbate over at night, but has very little real-world gain. Nice idea guys [Redhat], but why the hell break binary modules? 2004 is meant to be the year of the Linux desktop, yeah right.<p>If Redhat go ahead and release broken-without-a-cause kernels on the world, we can be sure that there is a higher probability that the average Linux beginner will throw his hands up in horror when he discovers he has to build and replace a core operating system component just in order to get OpenGL to work.<p>&quot;Linux compatible&quot; peripherals will become splintered yet more. Now not only must you match up your kernel major version (yes, there are still 2.2-only devices), but now you have to match up procedure calling strategies too. Do you think the average desktop user cares about this?<p>The reactions to the proposed patch sickens me slightly too, I see that some people still have trouble accepting that Linux is indeed used commercially and in environments where diehard open source fundamentalism does not go down well.<p>If it weren't for the fact that I'm earning money from Linux, I'd have probably found an alternative with a more realistic community. Maybe even a commercial operating system.<p>As ever, my opinions are my own, of limited scope, and potentially (probably) naive.<p><br>David.<br>Life? Don't talk to me about life.

      In earlier decades when code was small and fast it was pretty common to pass arguments in registers instead of stack.  Besides saving memory, it should be also faster, that can make people more interested about it.<p>The register passing was the thing making stuff binary incompatible, other changes should be usable without problems.<br>

      <p><i>The reactions to the proposed patch sickens me slightly too, I see that some people still have trouble accepting that Linux is indeed used commercially and in environments where diehard open source fundamentalism does not go down well.</i></p>

<p>You say that as if there was something wrong with it.</p>

<p>As the person you seem to deride as a diehard open source fundamentalist, let me put it this way.  I have absolutely nothing against Linux being used commercially and being used easily.  However, I was be MUCH happier if Linux could remain free while so doing.  If it gets to the point that us Linux geeks can't use Linux any more without resorting to binary-only drivers, well, then, in a sense Linux will have been "taken away" by the commercial interests who don't give a rats ass about free software.</p> 

<p>And, I think that a commercial interest that says "we just want it to work, we don't care about free vs. binary-only drivers" is very short sighted. Corporate America is waking up to the many advantages of free software right now-- among them, avoiding vendor lock-in.  But if in their adpotion they overmuch water down the philosophy that keeps free software free, many of those advantages may go away.</p>

<p>It is no accident that the first operating system that has created credible competition for Microsoft is free.  The fact that it is free is probably Linux's greatest strength, more so than its technical strengths.  If that goes away, although it may take time for everybody to realize it much of the advantage and attractiveness of Linux will go away.</p>

<p>So go on feeling all grouchy that you're in a community of hippie commies and wishing that you weren't stuck making money from Linux so that you could find a closed-source community more to your tastes.  In the mean time, those of us who really want to keep open source free will by and large recognize that it is for <i>practical</i> reasons that we want to do so.</p>

<p>-Rob</p>

      &gt; Now not only must you match up your kernel major version, <br>&gt; but now you have to match up procedure calling strategies too. <br>&gt; Do you think the average desktop user cares about this? <br> <br>The practical effect on the NVidias of the world will be small, in any case.  I <br>recently changed out an NVidia card for an ATI, because the libre ATI driver <br>does multiple video-outs per card, while the libre NVidia (NV) driver does not, <br>and I was tired of the hassle of having to recompile their driver every time I <br>recompiled the kernel, and of warnings about using an incompatible GCC, when <br>I compiled both with the SAME GCC, because of their stupid binary only stuff, <br>compiled with some GCC lagging the bleeding edge I'm accustomed to running.  <br>I've vowed never to go back to hardware requiring binary only driver solutions. <br> <br>Anyway, due to running NVidia's proprietary-ware solution for some time, I <br>know they release binary editions for each of the release versions of the major <br>distributions, often several for each, one for each kernel of each release.  This <br>wouldn't change.  They'd still end up having to make a different binary kernel <br>driver available for each kernel of each release, or force users to do their own <br>compiling.  Nothing different there.  The only difference would be one more <br>thing they'd have to check when doing their own compiling, behind the publicly <br>available drivers, and many of the kernel developers appear to be with me in not <br>caring about that.  They are making their own boat, let them have to deal with <br>their own sea-worthiness! <br> <br>I like the stricter controls on calls available to GPLed vs. non-GPLed modules in <br>the 2.6 kernel, as well, and am looking forward to 2.7 and beyond making <br>proprietary-ware driver suppliers lives even harder.  By the time 2.7 goes stable <br>as 2.8 or 3.0, ideally, Linux will be used by a large enough percentage of the <br>computing world that hardware manufacturers will begin to have to think twice <br>about passing up the Linux segment, and open source will be driving the bargain <br>according to open source terms.  That day is coming.  Hardware suppliers have <br>been used to marching to the tune of MS.  I can't believe they'll find it any <br>MORE difficult marching to the libre tune! <br> <br>Duncan  <br> <br>(Not a kernel hacker either, just a user that does his own kernel compiling, and <br>got tired of having to do a separate compile for all the hardware that wants to <br>force me to.. there's other hardware out there, and that's what I'll buy with <br>**MY** few $$!) <br>

      <p>This is the thing that geeks masturbate overnight, but is there anything     
wrong with that?</p>     
<p>As I see it, it works like this: <br />     
1) some geek decides to, just for fun, see how much horsepower he can     
still manage to squeeze out from the kernel. Note that this has nothing to     
do with Red Hat, the commercial IT world or anything like that, just     
curiosity<br />     
2) Someone at Red Hat reads a web-page/discussion, where he learns     
that by turning on three switches in gcc, he will have produced a kernel that     
performs 3% faster (or whatever, I realize that 3% is not speed in this    
article). He also     
learns, that there will be a side effect wrt binary-only modules. So it's a     
simple yes/no decision for him, including no masturbation at all!</p>     
<p>Let's continue: Since we know that Red Hat is not interested in the     
desktop anyway (they recommend using windows for that), it really looks     
to me, like he should go ahead with it. And let's face it, he might have     
some personal and political preferences too weighing in.</p>     
     
<p>As a more general question, I think we all agree, that wether or not     
nVidia agrees or not, from an idealistic and purely engineering point of     
view, the optimum situation would be that all source code is open. And     
mind you, <em>this is not a political statement</em>! It's a (technical) fact     
that this guy has just proven, that if you have access to all source code,     
you are able to do things that will make the kernel better, whereas if you     
don't have acces to all source, the same tricks will only break things.</p>     
<p>The question then facing us is: <em>should we strive for the     
technically optimum solution, or strive to maximize compatibility</em> in a     
world, where everyone is not (for whatever reason) willing to open up their     
sources. Not surprisingly, most kernel developers are more interested in     
going for the technically optimum solution rather than settling for a policy     
that has other benefits, but might never get you there. There are at least the     
following considerations supporting that:<br />     
- for people like Linus, that is what he's interested in in the first place. (He     
never wanted to make a kernel that nVidia could do something with, he just     
wanted to do a kernel.)  <br />   
- Some people might think, that Linux and FOSS currently has more     
power/momentum/whatever than nVidia and all other binary people     
combined, wherefore there is really no reason to compromise. Just stick to     
their strategy, and  the others will have to surrender. It might hurt at first, but     
in the end it will lead to the optimum solution you are striving for.  <br />   
- For Red Hat (et al) it could also be a wise strategy to avoid being too     
dependant on some specific hardware manufacturer. If people get too     
comfortable with nVidias binary-only dirvers, we could one day live in a     
world where we are not locked into MS software, and not into RH software     
(because its Open Source) but locked into nVidias drivers and their     
release schedules etc. RH probably don't want to be in a situation, where     
they have to ask nVidia (and a dozen others) for permission before doing     
a simple technical decision.

      Are you &quot;making money&quot; using a kernel that runs closed-source drivers?  If so, then why???  Just go buy a video card that has open-source drivers and sleep better at night.  Problem solved.<p>Back when Linux had fairly poor hardware support (1996), I was very much in favor of closed source drivers.  I remember wanting Linus to freeze an ABI so drivers wouldn't break with every kernel upgrade.  I was perfectly happy running random code.<p>Times have changed.  Hardware support in Linux is _excellent_.  And just imagine how bloated and incompetent the kernel would be if a driver ABI had been established.  RCU, elevator, preemt, etc. -- all these changes would have been effectively impossible (not without _massive_ amounts of cruft anyway).<p>Watching Linux over the past few years has convinced me: binary-only drivers seriously impede development.  They're also a security risk (heck, I might even consider them a downright threat).  New hardware is cheap.  There's just no need to put up with them anymore.<br>

      The problem with this is in two areas: 3d video cards and wireless cards.  In both cases, it's getting hard to buy a new card that has open-source support.  ATI used to be the company of choice, since you could get open source DRI drivers for its cards.  However, the last one (I believe) that had open-source 3d support is the Radeon 9200.<p>The binary-only drivers that many companies put out for these cards do work well enough for most users.  This means that the companies are seen as &quot;supporting Linux&quot;, and even many Linux users don't think there is a point in pushing them to allow open-source drivers.<p>(Plus, the legal environment has changed.  It's more dangerous now to reverse engineer than it used to be, *and* Linux is high-profile enough that you're probably more likely to get sued for doing it, and that suit is more likely to suceed.)<p>-Rob<br>

      Hmm. To me it looks like <b>more</b> reasons to make usage of closed-source drivers difficult, not less.

      &gt; Why do we need this change?<p>Didn't you read the article?<p>Smaller code means faster code and thus lower latencies, this is something that everybody wants.<p>There is no reason not to do this if it's technically sound, those few idiotic hardware developers who insist that paying all maintainance on their buggy binary-only driver is better than simply playing by the rules and letting people help them selves can bloody well stew.<p>I have a nVidia card and since starting to use it their driver has caused more crashes than I have ever had before, furtunatly it only crashes when X is shutting down and that means that I havn't lost any data, but you can bet I will not be buying any more binary-only crap when it's time to upgrade.<p>In any case, not taking a step forward because someone might need to update their driver is a silly idea, the kernel developers should do whatever it takes to make the kernel better, even if some things need to change as a result.

      Trying this now..   On a dual Opteron system, thus amd64/x86_64 arch, SMP <br>kernel, from the Mdk 2.4.22, release 27 package (which includes backporting <br>of some of the recent security patches, in case anyone is wondering), with <br>pretty much everything left as modules, except reiserfs, which I build-in since <br>that's what I run, to avoid having an initrd. <br> <br>With -Os and -funit-at-a-time, fully bzip2ed size went from 1.16 (base 10) <br>Megabytes, to 1.05, thus shrinking &gt;100 kb (base 10).  Unfortunately, I didn't <br>think to get the full-size size of the normal -O2 version from /usr/src/linux b4 I <br>recompiled with the new parameters. <br> <br>There is, however, an additional complication with -mregparm=3, not <br>mentioned in the article.  Acccording to the GCC manpage, not only must all <br>modules be built with it (as covered by the article), but so must the main <br>system libraries, which I take to include glibc, etc. if anything is built with it.  <br>At this point, I'm not going to rebuild them, just to see how much better I can <br>get it.  However, I AM trying the kernel rebuild (as I write), to check size, and <br>will of course try rebooting to it if the rebuild completes without issue.  Maybe <br>I'm interpreting the library reference incorrectly, and that doesn't apply to the <br>kernel, only to userspace builds. <br> <br>We'll see.. <br> <br>Duncan <br>

      &quot;Here&quot; being as mentioned in the upline post.. amd64, Mandrake's 2.4.22-27   <br>kernel, SMP, reiserfs built-in to avoid initrd, but basically everything else   <br>possible as modules.   <br> <br>Not sure how this will turn out with proportional fonts, and what it does to my <br>tabs, but.. <br> <br>kernel build switches			bzImage sz.	uncomp. sz.   <br>-O2 (standard)					1167599		6141545   <br>-Os -funit-at-a-time				1056342		5892105   <br>-Os -funit-at-a-time -mregparm=3	 995372		5366728   <br>   <br>As expected, due to the problem noted in the previous post, however, meaning   <br>system libs need compiled with the same switch, something I didn't do, the   <br>-mregparm=3 kernel wouldn't boot.  The -Os -funit-at-a-time kernel DID,   <br>however, boot, and is what I'm running now while writing this (in Konqueror,   <br>so it's stable enough to run X and KDE, and complete this note in Konqueror,   <br>at least).   <br>   <br>Haven't noticed any performance differences in the few minutes I've been  <br>running it, but then, with a dual Opteron and a gig of memory running a  <br>desktop, pretty much ANYTHING is relatively fast.  &lt;g&gt;   <br>   <br>Duncan   <br>

<p>Remember that the manual you're reading isn't specifically for compiling a Linux kernel.  It's for compiling any program.  Then clearly when it says libraries must be compiled with -mregparm, it means those libraries to which your program links.  The typical program is a user space program that links to "system libraries."  But the Linux kernel is not typical and does NOT link to glibc (unless it's user mode Linux!).  So you're OK there.

<p>You don't link the kernel to glibc (unless it's User Mode Linux), so don't worry about that one.

      Modules are already supposed to be used on the same kernel they are compiled for (same version, same config, same compiler options, basically the identical vmlinuz).  Sure, there are hacks that allow some modules to be loaded on other kernels (with similar versions), but no Linux vendors or hardware vendors shipping binary-only modules are asking their users to do so --- if your kernel version isn't supported, they either tell you to do some compilation (like what NVidia does) or just use some popular vendor kernel.<p>In this situation, how can changing the module ABI now break anything?  Just recompile all your modules, including NVidia-style ones.  If [insert the most popular kernel vendor  here] ships their next kernel using this patch, binary-module vendors that ship only .ko files will make a version for it... a new version will be needed even for a new kernel without this patch.

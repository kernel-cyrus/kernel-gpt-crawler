<p>
Non-maskable interrupts (or NMIs) are a hardware feature that is typically
used to signal hardware errors or other unrecoverable faults.  They
differ from regular interrupts in that they can occur when interrupts are
otherwise blocked (i.e. they are not maskable).  NMIs can be
caused by user-space programs, though, so their handling in the kernel
needs to be bulletproof or it can lead to security holes.  Since the
beginning of 2014, it would
seem that NMI 
handling has been subject to races that allow
user-space programs to 
elevate their privilegesâ€”a bug that is known as <a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3290">CVE-2015-3290</a>. 
</p>

<p>
NMIs are used by profiling and debugging tools, such as perf,
to determine where in the code the CPU is currently executing.  NMIs also <a 
href="/Articles/484932/">get nested</a>, effectively, when an NMI handler
causes an exception like a breakpoint or a page fault.  Handling that
nesting is complicated, which is what went astray and led to the bug.
</p>

<p>
The first notification about the problem came in a July&nbsp;22 <a
href="/Articles/655430/">post</a> to the oss-security mailing list from
Andy Lutomirski about
a number of NMI-handling security bugs.  All are security-related, but one
was embargoed to allow distributions to fix it before releasing any
details. 
So he mentioned CVE-2015-3290 without
giving any details, though he did include something of a warning: "<q>*Patch
your systems*</q>". 
</p>

<p>
The details came in a post-embargo <a href="/Articles/655436/">advisory</a> from
Lutomirski on August&nbsp;4.  In some detail, he described the problem, but
also provided a proof-of-concept program to tickle the bug.  It requires
that user space be able to do two things: arrange for nested NMIs to occur
and for those NMIs return to a 16-bit stack, which is normally done for
running 16-bit binaries using programs like <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosemu/">DOSEMU</a>.  A 16-bit stack
can be arranged via the <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/modify_ldt.2.html"><tt>modify_ldt()</tt></a>
system call. One way to generate the
NMIs required is to be run
with a 
heavy perf load, as the proof-of-concept exploit suggests.
</p>

<p>
The Linux nested-NMI handling relies on a small section of code that needs
to be run atomically.  That works fine on x86_64 when using <tt>iret</tt>
to return to a 64-bit stack (which effectively does the needed steps in an
atomic manner), but when the NMI is returning to a segment
with a 16-bit stack, <tt>iret</tt> does not restore the register state
correctly.  So the kernel has a workaround (called "espfix64") that tries
to handle that situation by doing a complicated stack-switching dance.
</p>

<p>
That stack switching is where the problem lies.  There are
approximately  19
instructions where a second (i.e. nested) NMI will cause the "atomic"
section to not be atomic.  Furthermore, an attacker who can arrange (or luck
into) landing in a two-instruction window in those instructions will be
able to reliably elevate 
their privileges to that of root.  During that window, the attacker
controls the address where the return from interrupt will go.  Outside of
the window, a nested NMI will cause various failures and crashes, which
Lutomirski's exploit will fix up while it waits for one to hit the window:
<div class="BigQuote">
A careful exploit (attached) can recover from all the crashy failures and
can regenerate a valid *privileged* state if a nested NMI occurs during the
two-instruction window.  This exploit appears to work reasonably quickly
across a fairly wide range of Linux versions.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The espfix64 code was added in Linux 3.13, which was released over a year
and a half ago in January&nbsp;2014.  Given that Lutomirski's proof of
concept works quickly, that means there are (or, hopefully, <i>were</i>) a
lot of systems that could be easily affected by this flaw.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=810bc075f78ff2c221536eb3008eac6a492dba2d">fix</a>
uses a "<q>sneaky trick</q>", according to Lutomirski.  Instead of
checking the value of the 64-bit stack pointer register (i.e. <tt>RSP</tt>) to
see if it points at the NMI stack to determine if there is a nested NMI, a
different test is used.  As he pointed out, malicious user-space code could
point <tt>RSP</tt> there, issue a system call, then cause an NMI to happen,
which would fool the kernel into believing it was processing a nested NMI
when it wasn't.

<p>
Lutomirski uses the fact that the "direction flag"
(DF) bit in the <tt>FLAGS</tt> register is atomically reset by the <tt>iret</tt>
instruction, so he sets that bit to indicate that the kernel is processing
an NMI.  His fix also changes the system-call entry point so that a
user-space program cannot set DF while it still controls the value of RSP.
</p>

<p>
CVE-2015-3290 and the rest of the NMI-handling problems that
Lutomirski has found seem a little concerning, overall.  NMIs are complex
beasties and their handling even more so.  It would be surprising if
there are not other problems lurking there.  But, for now, taking Lutomirski's
advice should be high on everyone's list.

The advice of "patch your systems" is nice and all, but your article fails to mention that to date (over a month later) that's still not possible for users of the 3.14 or 3.18 "stable" kernel series, which include none of the required fixes.<br>

I read that as saying that the flaw was introduced in 2014. Given the 3 months between releases, I would assume that 3.14 or 3.18 are not affected. If I am reading that right?<br>

According to the CVE it doesn't affect any of the RHEL kernels for RHEL 5, 6 and 7. RHEL 7 uses 3.10 so the espfix64 code was atleast added after v3.10.<br>
<p>
"This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 since they did not backport the nested NMI handler and espfix64 functionalities.<br>
This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 since they did not backport the espfix64 functionality and also did not backport upstream commit e00b12e64be9a3 that allowed an unprivileged local user to re-enable NMIs from the NMI handler."<br>

      Slight correction: the DF hack fixes a different, and far less severe, bug.  The <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/arch/x86/entry?id=9b6e6a8334d56354853f9c255d1395c2ba570e0a">actual fix</a> switches off the NMI IST stack entirely for NMIs that interrupt user code.

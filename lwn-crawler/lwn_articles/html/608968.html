<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2014/">Kernel Summit 2014</a>
</div>
Like almost every other free software project out there, the kernel has a
fundamental problem: not enough reviewers.  Some areas of development need
more review than others; at the top of the list must be the creation of
binary interfaces for user space, since those interfaces must be maintained
for a very long time.  But the problem goes beyond ABI definition.  Two
sessions at the 2014 Kernel Summit looked at the issue of review and how it
can be improved.
<p>
<h4>ABI changes</h4>
The first session, led by Michael Kerrisk and Andy Lutomirski, was
concerned with the ABI issue in particular.  Michael started by saying
that, whenever he gets around to testing a new system call, he finds a bug
50% of the time.  Christoph Hellwig remarked that the 50% number meant he
wasn't looking hard enough.  The point being made was that there is clearly
not enough review and testing of code that is going out the door in a
stable release.  Indeed, sometimes there has been no testing at all.  The
<tt>recvmmsg()</tt> system call, Michael said, was implemented with a
timeout value that cannot possibly have done anything sensible in the
initial release.
<p>
Sometimes we change ABIs as well, often without meaning to.  For example,
with the inotify interface, the
<tt>IN_ONESHOT</tt> option in early kernels did not trigger the
<tt>IN_IGNORED</tt> option; in later kernels that behavior has changed. 
<p>
There is, he said, no specification for new ABIs, a fact which makes them
hard to review and test.  The lack of a specification also leads to subtle
implementation problems.  Again citing inotify as an example, Michael
talked about the difficulties involved in tracking files that move between

<a href="/Articles/608970/"><img

vspace=3 align="right"></a> 

directories; see <a href="/Articles/605128/">this article</a> for details.
There are no man pages for most new system calls and not enough reviewers,
with the result that questionable designs get through.  The
<tt>O_TMPFILE</tt> option serves as a good example, Michael said; beyond
<a href="/Articles/562294/">its other problems</a>, there should also have
been consideration given to 
implementing that functionality as a separate system call.  
<p>
Andy added that a specification is good, but a unit test for a new ABI is
also a good thing to have.  At this point, Peter Zijlstra asked if maybe
the <a href="https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp">Linux Test
Project</a> would be a better place than the kernel tree for unit tests.
But LTP is concerned with testing more than just system calls, and many
kernel developers see the LTP system as a big extra thing that they would
have to install.
<p>
Ted Ts'o observed that developers must have tests for the new
features they have.  Otherwise they would not be exercising the expected
level of diligence in their work.  Dave Airlie added that it would be good
to have those tests in 
the kernel tree.  He also suggested that, perhaps, the community should
insist on the existence of a man page for any new system call before it
could be added to the mainline.  Michael responded that this has been tried
before, without much success.  But, it was pointed out, all four new system
calls added in 3.17 came with manual pages.
<p>
Ben Herrenschmidt pointed out that system calls are just the tip of the
iceberg.  The kernel's ABI includes other aspects, such as <tt>ioctl()</tt>
calls, sysfs, netlink, and more.
<p>
A topic that came up repeatedly is that any patch changing the kernel ABI
should be copied to the linux-api mailing list.  Perhaps, it was suggested,
it should be the subsystem maintainers' duty to ensure that this copying
happens when needed.  Josh Triplett suggested that the
<tt>get_maintainer</tt> script could be modified to make that happen, but
that idea was not received all that warmly.  That script tends to add lots
of unrelated recipients to patch mailings and is not universally popular
among kernel developers.
<p>
Peter Anvin made the claim that the linux-api list simply is not working.
Perhaps it would be better, he said, to just merge the man pages into the
kernel tree so that the code and documentation could be patched together.
Michael responded that this idea <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/todo.html#migrate_to_kernel_source">has
come up before</a>.  There are advantages 
and disadvantages to it.  On the down side, there is a lot of material in
the man pages that does not describe the kernel interface.  The man pages
are documentation for application developers, not for kernel developers, so
they cover a lot of glibc interfaces, wrappers around system calls, and
more.  
<p>
The discussion wound down with some repeated suggestions that 
maintainers should insist on man pages before accepting new system calls
into the kernel.  The plea to copy the linux-api list for changes affecting
the kernel ABI was also repeated.  For a while, at least, kernel developers
may try to do better, but no true solution to the problem was found at this
session. 
<p>
<h4>Getting more reviewers</h4>
<p>
James Bottomley stepped up to run a more general discussion on the problem
of patch review.  How, he asked, can we increase the amount of review that
code going into the mainline gets?  Are there any new ideas out there on
how the kernel's review process can be improved?  No answers resulted, but
the session did cover some of the mechanics of how review is performed.
<p>
Peter Zijlstra said that he has been getting patches with bogus
<tt>Reviewed-by</tt> tags.  "Bogus," in this case, means that no in-depth
review of the code has actually happened.  Often, these tags come from

<a href="/Articles/608972/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2014/ks/JamesBottomley-sm.jpg" width=150 height=188
alt="[James Bottomley]" title="James Bottomley" hspace=3 vspace=3
align="left"></a> 


other developers working for the same company as the patch author, but not
always.  James said that he ignores <tt>Reviewed-by</tt> tags unless they
are offered in an email that has substantive comments in it.
<p>
Darren Hart said, though, that these tags can be the result of internal
review that happens before patches are posted on a public list.  In some
companies, at least, this review process is serious and rigorous; it makes
sense to document those reviews in the patch.  Dave asked why the process
has to be done internally; why not expose the whole process on the public
lists?  Darren answered that, with almost any project, it is natural to go
for "small-group consensus" before facing the wider world.
<p>
James added that he is often suspicious of same-vendor reviews, but they
are not necessarily invalid.  It is really a matter of how much one trusts
the specific reviewers involved.
<p>
He went on to ask a general process question: how much can a patch change
before a <tt>Reviewed-by</tt> tag needs to be reviewed?  A white-space
change probably should not bring about a need for a new review, but
substantial changes to how the patch works should.  There were some
differences of opinion in the room about just where the line should be
drawn; in the end it seems to come down to common sense and the subsystem
maintainer's opinion on the matter.
<p>
The session ended with Linus jumping in and saying that, in the end, the
<tt>Reviewed-by</tt>, <tt>Acked-by</tt>, and <tt>Cc</tt> tags all mean the
same thing: the person named in the tag will be copied on the report if the
patch turns out to be buggy.  Some developers use one tag, while others use
a different one, but there is no real difference between them.  The session
closed with some general disagreement over the meanings of the different
tags — and no new ideas on how to get more review of kernel code.

Developers write code to "scratch an itch".  So reviewers find themselves scratching someone else's itch, which is no where near as satisfying.<br>
<p>
We clearly need to introduce an irritant so that more people get itchy about more things.  It works for oysters and pearls!<br>

I am often left wondering what articles such as this mean by "ABI", and whether there is any meaningful distinction intended by the author from the concept commonly known as "API".<br>
<p>
Jonathan: I'd be interested to hear you expand a bit on what you intend to convey by the term, but I'll also note what I (used to) understand by it.<br>
<p>
I was brought up with the following distinction, which I found a useful one.  Consider a program which consists of source code, and is built into an executable image for a platform using some build tools.  The program's source consumes whatever APIs it consumes.  The build tools consume the ABI of the platform for which the program is built.<br>
<p>
A couple of useful results stem from this.  One is that if you need to run the program on a different platform, you do not need to alter the program's source code, you just need to change the target platform for which it is built.  If you have access to the source, a simple rebuild adapts it to a different ABI.<br>
<p>
What I see in articles such as this is the term "ABI" being used in a way indistinguishable from "API".  The meaning of the IN_ONESHOT option, or ioctl() calls, sysfs, netlink, etc, are all relevant to the program's source code, not the way it's compiled / built.  The semantics of these interface elements are consumed in the program's source, not by the build tools.  If the definition of one of these interface elements "changes", it is the program's source which will need to be modified; the program image can not simply be rebuilt from the same source to fix the issue.<br>
<p>
I don't really want to quibble if people want to use the term "ABI" in this way, since I am not one to argue definitions, but I am concerned we are losing a useful distinction.  So does anyone have a suggestion for a term to unambiguously refer to the useful concept described earlier: that set of interface elements consumed in the process of building a program's source code into an executable program image for a particular platform (so calling conventions, image layout, etc, but not anything visible from within the program's own source)?<br>

      I'm probably overly sloppy on this score, but I try to be consistent.  An ABI is the interface used by a binary program (not the build tools).  If you want compatibility, that ABI must be held steady so that binary programs do not break; that encompasses both calling conventions and semantics.  That is the kind of "ABI stability" that the kernel tries for.
<p>
An API is a source-level concept.  Again, it covers both calling conventions and semantics; consider the POSIX API as an example.  If you get the same results on a new system after rebuilding, the API is compatible.  So, in my mind, the <a rel="nofollow" href="/Articles/605607/"><tt>setjmp()</tt> change in glibc</a> that broke things on s390 systems was an ABI break, but not an API break.
<p>
Perhaps others disagree, but that's always been how I've seen it...

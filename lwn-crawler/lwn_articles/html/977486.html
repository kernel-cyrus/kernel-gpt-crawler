           <hr>
<a href="/Articles/lsfmmbpf2024/">LSFMM+BPF</a>
</div>
<p>
VFS maintainer Christian Brauner led a discussion about the possibility of
selectively dropping the contents of the page cache for a filesystem in a
session at the
2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  As he described in his
<a href="/ml/all/20240116-tagelang-zugnummer-349edd1b5792%40brauner/">topic
proposal</a>, the use case that started him down this path comes from
GNOME, which wants to be able to safely suspend access to an encrypted home
directory.  While it is known to kernel
developers, it is surprising to others that reads from encrypted
filesystems that have been suspended will succeed if the data to be read
still exists in the 
page cache.
</p>

<h4>Secrets exposed</h4>

<p>
Brauner began the session by quickly describing the test case that
reproduces the problem, which he included in his proposal (and in his <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y42HhE_dHeeOhBUJRN5Lxe1w7XHEFePLmhgzj0zJ-SE/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>).
It creates an image file, uses the <a
href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup">LUKS cryptsetup tool</a> to
turn it into an encrypted volume, makes an XFS filesystem on it, and
mounts it.  The next step is to write the string "secrets" to a file on the
filesystem and use the <a
href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/cryptsetup-luksSuspend.8.en">luksSuspend</a>
operation to suspend the encrypted block deviceâ€”a simple <tt>cat</tt>
on the file will still show the secret data.
</p>

<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/977819/">

align="right" alt="[Christian Brauner]" title="Christian Brauner" width=206 height=280>
</a>

<p>
He asked if there was some way to add an API that would drop the
contents of the page
cache so that reading the file would give an error.  He went through a list 
of the objections (and other ideas) that had been posted in the
topic-proposal thread, which he had
collected onto a slide.
</p>

<p>
On the mailing list, 
Jan Kara had <a
href="/ml/all/20240116114519.jcktectmk2thgagw@quack3">raised the problem of
referenced folios in the page cache</a>, which could come from a <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/vmsplice.2.html"><tt>vmsplice()</tt></a>
call; those pages cannot be dropped.  Kara also asked about the
interaction of a page-cache-drop operation with <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html"><tt>mlock()</tt></a>
and <a href="/ml/all/20240117143528.idmyeadhf4yzs5ck@quack3">noted</a> that
pages mapping executable code "<q>are
practically unevictable</q>". 
Beyond that, if the intent is to defend against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">cold boot
attacks</a>, there will be a <a
href="/ml/all/20240215135709.4zmfb7qlerztbq6b@quack3">need to zero-out the
memory</a>, since dropping the page-cache entries does not change the
memory contents, Kara added.
</p>

<p>
Matthew Wilcox had <a
href="/ml/all/ZafpsO3XakIekWXx@casper.infradead.org">suggested</a> using
the <tt>security_file_permission()</tt> hook for Linux security modules
(LSMs) to inhibit reading the data.  So a new BPF LSM program, say, could
be attached when the suspend operation is done to return an error for any
reads, Brauner said.  He thinks there is value in considering some kind of
API for page-cache dropping for other use cases, beyond just cold-boot
protection. For example, David Howells has told him that he would use an
API of that sort for AFS; systemd may also have a use case for it, so it is
at least something to consider adding.
</p>

<p>
Amir Goldstein said that there are some tests that are part of the <a
href="https://github.com/linux-test-project">Linux Test Project</a> (LTP)
that currently do "some gymnastics" to try to drop the page cache for a
filesystem; it is not reliable, however, so an API would also be useful for
testing. Jeff Layton pointed out that Trond Myklebust has posted patches
for NFS that
will drop the page cache for individual inodes, which might provide part
of the solution.  Brauner said that Kent
Overstreet
<a
href="/ml/all/h5wq7dsi6r7cjjmkpo2dvn5x662eseluzd2kmzbkzegntzlptd@ncjzyaurmiwb">mentioned
a similar feature</a> for subvolume deletion in bcachefs.  Dave Chinner
pointed out that <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/posix_fadvise.2.html">posix_<tt>fadvise()</tt></a>
can drop the page cache for a particular inode already.
</p>

<h4>Dumb idea?</h4>

<p>
"You can say it's a dumb idea", Brauner said with a grin.  Layton
disagreed, saying that it is useful.  Wilcox agreed with that: "I can see
the use case, it makes sense, it is a reasonable thing to want, it is just
a hard thing to implement".  There are ways to deal with
<tt>vmsplice()</tt> and <tt>mlock()</tt>, he said, by marking those pages
as "not up to date" and zeroing them.  But it is "really tricky" for things
like pages that have been handed off to an RDMA driver, which is
maintaining the state of those pages.
</p>

<p>
"Is it okay to just fail?", Brauner asked; maybe the operation can just
return an error if it cannot be done fully.  Wilcox said that probably 99%
of the pages could be dropped without encountering one of the corner cases. 
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that perhaps part of the problem was that the feature had
been introduced as a security feature, which causes developers to
immediately focus on the corner cases.  <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/filesystems/fscrypt.html">Fscrypt</a>
has a "best effort" mechanism that tries to remove all of the directory
entries and flush all of the inodes whenever the key gets removed from the
keyring. There was no effort to deal with the possibility that encrypted
files were still open, because the feature originally targeted ChromeOS,
where it only happened after the user session ended.  It was not a complete
solution and was not advertised as a feature, nor documented.
</p>

<p>
That is a possible path forward for this feature, he said, but if there is
a need to try to handle all of the corner cases, it is going to be
difficult to do.  Wilcox said that if you need to ensure that your
LibreOffice documents on the filesystem are no longer accessible, that
would be fairly straightforward, but if you want to guarantee that for
every single file on the filesystem, it is much harder.
</p>

<p>
Overstreet said that it was "yet another <tt>revoke()</tt> discussion",
which really needs to be resolved at some point.  The <a
href="/Kernel/Index/#revoke"><tt>revoke()</tt> system call</a> has been a
topic in filesystem circles for more than a decade (at least); it is meant
to close all open file descriptors for a given file, but has run
aground on a myriad of corner cases.  There are multiple places where
<tt>revoke()</tt> is needed (<tt>fsck</tt> in corner cases, debugfs),
Overstreet said, so someone should tackle the problem.  Kara said that he
would be reluctant to give guarantees for dropping the page cache, because it greatly depends on the
context of how the filesystem is being used, but in many cases it should
work fine.
</p>

<h4>Systemd use</h4>

<p>
Lennart Poettering said that systemd would like to use this feature,
similar to the way that fscrypt does.  A best-effort solution would be fine,
though he wants to get some kind of error indication when it fails; the
filesystem should try to drop as many pages as it can from the cache and,  perhaps,
report the number that could not be dropped.  Systemd will use the
control-groups interface to freeze the user session before invoking the
operation, which should make for fewer corner-case problems.  The systemd use case should not be conflated with the cold-boot-protection case, where the encrypted device needs to be suspended and the
pages need to be zeroed out, which is more than what systemd (and others)
need, he said.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that fscrypt reports the number of inodes it was not able to
evict.  It puts out a log message with that number along with a single
inode number as a sample; the information is mostly for ChromeOS
developers to use for debugging.  It is "half-assed, but that's what we did". 
</p>

<p>
There is a question of what to do with dirty pages that are in need of
writeback when this page-cache removal is done, Chinner said.  Are they
thrown away, or does the operation wait for the writeback to be done?  And
where would writeback errors be reported?
Brauner said that the belief is that the device has been suspended, so
there will be no dirty pages.  Ts'o said that when the key gets removed,
fscrypt writes all of its dirty inodes, because it will not be able to once
the key is gone. If user space has been suspended, as in the systemd use
case, there is no one to report any errors to anyway, so a console message
is all that can be done.
</p>

<p>
Chinner said that it is important to make it clear to users of any new API
that they are responsible for ensuring that the filesystem is frozen before
dropping its page cache.  Dropping the page cache for filesystems that have executable files
mapped into memory will not work well, for example.  But those are not the
types of files people are looking to protect with a feature of this sort,
Wilcox said; it is things like document files and web-browser history that
people are concerned about.  Brauner said that the feature would be
targeted at system-level software that is assumed to know what it is doing;
Wilcox said that a 99% solution will increase the security for everyone,
but it is important not to claim that it is a 100% solution.
</p>

<p>
Goldstein wondered about the inode cache; is file data the only concern or
should there be protections for metadata as well?  Chinner said that trying
to purge the inode cache while the filesystem is frozen will deadlock.
Wilcox said that the directory-entry cache should also be purged, but did
not think that purging the inode cache was needed; Chinner said that could still
deadlock, however.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o noted that the order used by fscrypt was to get rid of all
of the directory entries, shrink the inode cache, do any writeback needed,
and, only then, freeze the filesystem and purge the page cache; that is the
right order to do those things, but it is all
done on a best-effort basis.  He suggested that perhaps the luksSuspend
operation could add some of these extra steps, since suspending an
encrypted device would generally benefit from removing this extra data from
memory. 
</p>

<h4>Shrinkers</h4>

<p>
The current mechanisms available for clearing out the directory-entry and inode
caches are the <a href="/Kernel/Index/#Memory_management-Shrinkers">shrinkers</a>, Chinner said, but there is no way to confine them
to a single 
superblock; in addition, those caches are partitioned by memory control
groups, so any clearing operation will need to take those into account, as
well. Wilcox said that an unmount operation would obviously clear all of
this information, so perhaps that could be used. But Chinner said that is
not workable for this use case because the
users are suspending the system to RAM, and have user-space applications
running; an unmount would disrupt all of that.
</p>

<p>
Overstreet said that the feature could mesh well with the idea of live
filesystem migration.  Bcachefs developers are getting ready to release
synchronous 
send and receive for the filesystem, so combining that with a page-cache
flush/drop operation would provide the ability to live-migrate a container
and its filesystems to another host.  Overstreet clarified that he was talking
about the same idea as the <a href="/Articles/581558/">Btrfs send and
receive</a>. 
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of use cases for cleaning up caches on a
per-superblock basis, though it is seen as a difficult problem by some.
Chinner said that the shrinker interface could be used, with per-superblock
functionality added; it would not be hugely difficult, since much of the
mechanism for the cleanup is already done there.  He has been looking at
using shrinkers as a way to implement dropping the caches because the
existing ways to do so (using <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html#drop-caches"><tt>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</tt></a>)
take a long time.  That runs as a single thread, so it
can take up to 15 minutes to run for large caches ("with a few hundred
million cached inodes"), he said, which is
problematic for benchmarking and other uses.
</p>

<p>
Kara wondered whether the shrinker was the right interface or whether
something based on what is done at unmount time might be better.  There is
an inherent problem that shrinkers are focused on memory reclaim, rather
than on the task needed for this feature.  He thought there might be value
in a new interface that was somewhat "saner".  Chinner acknowledged that
there was more to do beyond what the shrinkers do, but thought that they might
be part of the solution.
</p>

<p>
Luis Chamberlain asked why this new mechanism would not be used whenever a
filesystem is frozen.  Chinner said that filesystems are often frozen for
backup purposes, so the page-cache entries are still important. There was
some discussion of the API and whether it should be an <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><tt>ioctl()</tt></a>
command or something else. Chinner thinks
that some new API, probably via a system call, that is not
tied to filesystem freezing or anything else, is likely to be the right way
forward; that gives the most flexibility if the internals need to change
along the way.

I can imagine 1 or 2 scenarios from the top of my head - no idea whether those are the ones Gnome has in mind. If you want to lock you laptop/whatever device (screen lock), or do suspend-to-ram (S2, S3), you might want to add a bit more safety and freeze encrypted file systems until someone enters a valid authentication again to signal the owner is back. In that intermitted time frame it's probably unfeasible to actually unmount the FS as it might be in use by something.<br>
<p>
Again, I don't know whether that's the scenario aimed at here.<br>

      <p>Unmounting requires the mounted filesystem to be entirely unused, or to be willing to kill any processes holding references to it.  For protecting user data, you'd want a way to make filesystem data and metadata inaccessible cheaply and frequently, maybe whenever a screen (desktop, phoneâ€¦) is locked, so it can't disrupt running processes and the filesystem must appear in the same state after unlock.
</p>
<p>Thinking along those lines, dropping caches does have a visible impact in terms of performance, so it would be nice to have the page cache encrypted instead. But decrypting on every access would be a much more intrusive change.

<p>
It's not compatible with _keeping_ all the data encrypted, but perhaps the GP meant the en-/decryption of the pagecache contents as a one-off operation (same semantics as suspending/resuming the LUKS volume).<br>
<p>
I don't see an immediate reason why that wouldn't work â€” just mark all the PTEs as not present, similar to them being swapped out.<br>

What's annoying about this whole proposal is how under specified it is.<br>
<p>
It starts out with "we want the page cache to be inaccessible". Then it turns out to be OK if 99% of pages are inaccessible, but 1% are still accessible. But a purely programmatic prohibition is unacceptable because evilmaid attacks. But we don't care enough about evilmaid attacks to zero pages which are being evicted from the pagecache.<br>

It all feels like "we want to feel secure but we don't want to pay very much for it".<br>

I disagree.  I believe it's a matter of "we should take feasible steps towards maximizing security."<br>
<p>
Treating anything less than exactly 100% secure as being the same as 0% secure is the sort of thing the cryptography/security people frequently do, which tends to set Linus off (and I agree with him.)<br>
<p>
The troublesome feature in question seems to be "cryptsetup-suspend", which (according to the documentation) flushes all pending writes to disk and then purges the encryption (more relevantly here, *decryption*) keys from memory.   After this point, up until cryptsetup-luksresume is executed to reload the key (presumably the result of the user reauthenticating themselves), any attempt to read from the encrypted block device will fail.<br>
<p>
However, not all attempts to read from the *filesystem* will result in reads from the *block device*.  Sometimes everything needed to read a file on that filesystem is still in the page cache, in which case that file -- one that is nominally stored on an encrypted filesystem for which the system does not have the decryption keys available -- is still readable.<br>
<p>
The request is simple: provide some sort of method to tell the kernel to evict as much information as possible from its own caches.  The article points out that there are many cases where a page cannot be evicted:<br>
<p>
1. It's part of an active vmsplice call<br>
2. It's part of a DMA operation (especially an RDMA operation)<br>
3. It's mapped as executable code (e.g. a running binary)<br>
<p>
I would expect (and based on the article, the kernel devs agree with me) that the overwhelming majority of the files one would be interested in keeping secret don't fall into any of these categories.  I'm not likely to be vmsplicing or RDMAing my SSH private key anywhere.  <br>
<p>
It *is* quite reasonable for me to be executing code from an encrypted block device -- as a software developer, a *lot* of the executables that I run are from my home directory, because I just compiled them.  But I'm not super concerned about someone gaining access to such an executable via the page cache.  And if I *am*, well, then it's on me to make sure I kill that process before I close the lid on my laptop.<br>

I guess I could envision useful scenarios from a security perspective, but generally this seems like a bad idea. Turning off the page cache entirely for the filesystem would imply all read / write operations have to go directly through disk, which is orders of magnitude slower (generally) than DRAM. A quick bit of searching shows the O_DIRECT flag attempts to minimize the involvement of the page cache (though not completely avoiding it).<br>
<p>
Out of curiosity, what use cases would you find this useful for?<br>

A lot of databases or data-intensive applications just need to be able to write the data to disk, and they might not care about reading them at all. Or the other way around, they might read data only once, send it through the network, and then they might never need that particular piece of data again.<br>

Or the filesystem might actually implement its own caching scheme, which might be better for some scenarios than what the kernel provides; if I were implementing a RDMA-based distributed FS, I'd want as much control over the memory I could possibly get. Pagecache is useful, but there is a huge potential for data duplication in memory between pagecache and the implementation's own details - even without RDMA, if the FS implementer has better ideas for cache management for a given use-case, duplication is currently unavoidable.<br>

Itâ€™s trivial if you want to write your own - nothing about the kernel and VFS forces you to use the page cache.  Just donâ€™t call those hooks.<br>
<p>
Itâ€™s just an enormous pain to write your own and youâ€™d better hope youâ€™re better and can stay better because you get no benefit from general improvements from the community.<br>
<p>
I *work* on an RDMA enabled distributed FS that uses the Linux page cache - Lustre, itâ€™s the most popular one - and we donâ€™t get any duplication from that.  Nothing about the page cache gives us any trouble there - theyâ€™re just pages.  You can do RDMA with them.<br>
<p>
Youâ€™re also able to be selective about when you use the Linux page cache, as long as youâ€™re willing to handle alignment issues yourself and cover conflicts (generally with flushing like DIO does),<br>

I'd love to be able to provide my own memory that backs the mmaped file's data, speaking from the filesystem's perspective.<br>
<p>
RDMA over IP is coming and that's not all - I believe CXL is going to eventually enable PCIe-link-layer based inter-CPU linking between different systems within a rack with even better latencies than what current RDMA world can do - and over time, possibly, I can imagine scaling out via fiber - which is now financially out of reach for most due to requiring on-chip transceivers, but that situation is also not static.<br>
<p>
Currently, when I'm thinking about a FS that does in-kernel RDMA over some PCIe device - or even better, PCIe directly + let's say we add non-transparent bridging of different systems into the mix - truly taking things into own hands as far as I understand it, requires, that the really interesting memory with hot data is all in the PCIe controller window. As I currently understand it, where of course I might be wrong, my feeling is that implementing this with current NTBs seems hard because either they're lacking in DMA capabilities + pagecache in the loop, or they lack publicly available documentation. Going forward I think it should be manageable even with pagecache in the loop, but it still would be nice to not have to worry about it at all.<br>

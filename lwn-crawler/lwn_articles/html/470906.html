Inserting loadable modules into a running kernel is clearly a convenient
feature.  It allows distributions to have relatively small kernels while
still supporting a wide variety of hardware and use-cases, but it can also
allow unwanted modules to be loaded in a way that may not be all that easy
to detect.  Those modules could simply be
binary-only drivers that the distribution or service provider doesn't want
to support&mdash;or they could be some kind of malware.  A recently posted
patch set will help to avoid those problems by giving the option of
building a kernel that will only allow modules that have
been cryptographically signed to be loaded, or to simply detect the
presence of
unsigned modules.
</p>

<p>
David Howells posted the <a href="/Articles/470435/">patches</a>, which are
based on code that has been running in Fedora and RHEL kernels for years.
Therefore, it should have been "<q>thoroughly tested</q>" Howells
said in the final <a href="/Articles/471013/">patch</a> in the series
(which also contains the module-signing.txt kernel Documentation file). The
patch allows for signing modules using the RSA signature algorithm with any
of the SHA family of hash algorithms.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea is that public keys can be built into the kernel and, if
<tt>CONFIG_MODULE_SIG</tt> is enabled, used to
check the validity of modules before they are loaded.  If
<tt>CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE</tt> is enabled at compile time (or
<tt>enforcemodulesig=1</tt> is passed on the kernel command line), only
those modules that can be verified with one of the public keys built into
the kernel will be loaded. If the "force" option is not used, unsigned
modules will still be loaded.  In either case, modules with corrupt or
incorrect signatures, 
or those that are signed with a key that is not on the keyring, will be
rejected. 
</p>

<p>
In order to make that work, there needs to be a way to build signed
modules.  That is done by creating public and private keys in the top-level
kernel directory (in <tt>kernel.pub</tt> and <tt>kernel.sec</tt> by
default).  The public key will be processed with the kernel's
<tt>bin2c</tt> utility and written as <tt>crypto/signature/key.h</tt>.  The
public and secret key will then be used with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) to sign the
modules automatically as they are built.  There are several options that
can be passed on the make command line to govern the location of the key
files as well as options to pass to <tt>gpg</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, the modules can be stripped for inclusion into initial ramdisk
images and debuginfo can be included in a separate ELF section that is not
included in the signature calculation.  That means that all of the variants
of a particular module can share a single signature that is stored in 
the module itself (in the <tt>.module_sig</tt> ELF section).  In addition,
the output of <tt>/proc/modules</tt> has been changed to add a "U" to
unsigned modules so that they can be detected.
</p>

<p>
The patch also modifies the kernel's crypto subsystem to allow for the new
key type and to add an RSA signature verification algorithm.  That requires
using the multi-precision integer (MPI) library from GPG, which was
reworked from the Red Hat version for kernel inclusion by Dmitry Kasatkin.
That code is already in 
the security tree in order to support the Extended Verification Module
(EVM) digital signature extension.  It also requires a minimal parser for
the OpenPGP format (which is the kind of keys and signatures that GPG
generates).  
</p>

<p>
There is also something of a chicken-and-egg problem. Many distributions
have crypto and hash algorithms built as modules, but the RSA algorithm and
whichever hash is being used to generate the signatures needs to be present
or an enforcing kernel won't be able to load any modules at all.  For that
reason, 
the patches ensure that if module signatures are selected at compile time,
the RSA and chosen hash algorithms are not built as modules themselves.
Modules are then loaded in the usual way, with <tt>insmod</tt>, but the
signature will be checked by suitably configured kernels.
</p>

<p>
There has been relatively little discussion or complaints about the patches
in the three revisions that have been posted since Howells began the
process in late November.  H. Peter Anvin is <a
href="/Articles/471023/">concerned</a> about adding a OpenPGP parser to the
kernel, and Howells was quick to <a href="/Articles/471024/">point out</a>
that the parser is just the minimal amount needed to pull keys and
signatures out of OpenPGP-formatted data.  Both Anvin and James Morris were
unconvinced about the need for supporting the (now deprecated) DSA
signature algorithm and Howells has pulled that code out in the most recent
revision.

<p>
This is not the first time Howells has proposed these
(or similar) changes as those <a href="/Articles/92617/">efforts</a>
stretch back to (at least) 2004.  He has now <a
href="/Articles/471006/">requested</a> that the code be included into the
Morris's security tree.  If that happens, and no major complaints arise, we
could potentially see signed module support in Linux 3.3.
</p>

<p>
While it is a useful feature, particularly for those trying to support
Linux kernels <i>without</i> random drivers from who-knows-where, it only
places another set of hurdles in front of malware authors.  Since root
privileges are required to load modules in the first place, a malware
author will only need to find a way to insert code into the running kernel
without using the module loading facility.  Once upon a time,
<tt>/dev/kmem</tt> could be used for that, but many distribution kernels
don't support it any more. Prior to the advent of
<tt>CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM</tt>, <tt>/dev/mem</tt> would have provided
another way, but distributions are generally enabling that option as well.
 Exploiting some kind of kernel bug is the most
probable route for these root-privileged attackers, but is certainly a more
fragile approach than simply inserting a module. 

<p>
Another potential use (or abuse depending on perspective) of the feature
is for device makers or distributions to lock down their kernels.  That
would leave users who wish to add functionality (or remove anti-features)
in the same place as the malware author: looking for a kernel bug to
exploit.  Of course, some users may just find a way to replace the kernel
entirely in that scenario.

What if one just wanted to embed into a kernel binary a fixed list of modules that could be loaded? Hypothetically, one could build a kernel with some modules, embed all those modules' SHA-256 hashes in the kernel, and use no public-key cryptography.  Has anyone contemplated this as a use-case? (I can see pros and cons of my naive thought, but I'm sure a kernel/crypto expert can see better!)<br>

That approach would work equally well, insofar as root can replace the set of hashes as easily as the set of public keys.  It doesn't work well if the vendor wants to supply out-of-tree modules since the kernel won't have the hashes of those modules, compared to just signing those modules with the appropriate vendor key.  But for the most part it would work fine, and remove a pile of more complex crypto code from the kernel.<br>

Or else the modules could be built into the kernel image, perhaps as a static read-only ramdisk.  Then the kernel will only load modules from this ramdisk and nowhere else.  Then there is no need for hash functions either.<br>

The gplv2 and Linux definitely doesn't require that as Linux is used in locked down devices all the time. The gplv3 doesn't specifically require sharing of keys, afaik, but it does require there be a method to replace the shipping software with a modified version. That can be done by any method such as replaceable keys, disabling of signature checking, etc. <br>

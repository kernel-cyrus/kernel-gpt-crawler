Linux containers are something of an amorphous beast, at least with
respect to the kernel.  There are lots of facilities that the kernel
provides (namespaces, control groups, seccomp, and so on) that can be
composed by user-space tools into containers of various shapes and
colors; the kernel is blissfully unaware of how user space views that
composition. But there is interest in having the kernel be more aware of
containers and for it to be able to distinguish what user space considers
to be a single container.  One particular use case for the kernel managing
container identifiers is the <a href="https://github.com/linux-audit">audit
subsystem</a>, which needs unforgeable IDs for containers that can be
associated with 
audit trails.
</p>

<p>
Back in early October, Richard Guy Briggs <a
href="/Articles/740730/">posted</a> the second version of his RFC for
kernel container IDs that can be used by the audit subsystem.  The first
version was <a href="/Articles/740732/">posted</a> in mid-September, but is
not the only proposal out there.  David Howells <a
href="/Articles/723561/">proposed</a> turning containers into full-fledged
kernel objects back in May, but seemingly ran aground on objections that
the proposal "<q>muddies the waters and makes things more
brittle</q>", in the <a href="/Articles/723565/">words</a> of namespaces
maintainer Eric W. Biederman. 
</p>

<p>
Briggs's proposal is focused on the needs of the audit subsystem, rather
than trying to solve any larger problem, however.   He <a
href="/Articles/699819/">described</a> some of the problems for the audit
subsystem in a 2016 Linux Security Summit talk.  In addition, he laid out
some of the requirements for container tracking
in <a href="/Articles/740734/">response</a> to a <a
href="/Articles/740735/">query</a> from Carlos O'Donell about the first RFC:
<div class="BigQuote">
<ul class="spacylist">
<li>ability to filter unwanted, irrelevant or unimportant messages before
  they fill queue so important messages don't get lost.  This is a
  certification requirement.

<li>ability to make security claims about containers, require tracking of
  actions within those containers to ensure compliance with established
  security policies.

<li>ability to route messages from events to relevant audit daemon
  instance or host audit daemon instance or both, as required or
  determined by user-initiated rules
</ul>
</div>

<p>
As proposed, audit container IDs would be handled as follows.
A container
orchestration system would register the ID of a container (a 16-byte UUID)
by writing to a special file in the  <tt>/proc</tt> directory for the
container's initial process.  Briggs proposes a
new capability (<tt>CAP_CONTAINER_ADMIN</tt>) that would be required for a
process to be able to register a container ID, but no process
 would be able to change its own container ID even with
the capability. 
</p>

<p>
Registering the container ID would associate the process ID (PID) of the
first process (in 
the initial PID namespace) and all of that process's namespaces (using the
<a href="http://blog.man7.org/2016/12/introspecting-namespace-relationships.html">namespace filesystem device and inode numbers</a>) with the ID
in an <tt>AUDIT_CONTAINER</tt> record that gets logged.  The container IDs
would then be used in various audit log messages to associate auditable
events with the container that performed them.  Any child processes would
inherit the container ID of their parent so that all of the processes and
threads in a container would be associated with its ID.  If the first
process has already forked or created threads, the registration would
either fail or all of the child processes/threads would be associated with
the ID; the right course will be determined as part of the RFC and
implementation process.
</p>

<p>
Audit events would be generated for all namespace creation and destruction
operations; creation events would be associated with the container ID of the
process performing the action, destruction events occur when there are no
more references to a namespace, so just the device and inode of the
namespace destroyed would be logged.  Changes to a process's namespaces
would also generate an audit event that records the new and old namespace
information. 
</p>

<p>
The new capability for container IDs was one of the first things questioned
about the proposal.  Casey Schaufler <a href="/Articles/740743/">asked</a>
how there could be a kernel container capability when the RFC clearly
states that the kernel knows nothing about containers.  Briggs <a
href="/Articles/740744/">likened</a> container IDs to login user IDs
and session IDs "<q>that the kernel tracks for the convenience of
userspace</q>".  He suggested that if the <tt>CAP_CONTAINER_ADMIN</tt>
name was the problem, he would be fine with something like
<tt>CAP_AUDIT_CONTAINERID</tt>, but that was not the core of Schaufler's <a
href="/Articles/740747/">complaint</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Sorry, but what aspect of the kernel security policy is this
capability supposed to protect? That's what capabilities are
for, not the undefined support of undefined user-space behavior.
<p>
If it's audit behavior, you want CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL. If it's
more than audit behavior you have to define what system security
policy you're dealing with in order to pick the right capability.
<p>
We get this request pretty regularly. "I need my own capability
because I have a niche thing that isn't part of the system security
policy but that is important!" Fit the containerID into the
system security policy, and if that results in using CAP_SYS_ADMIN,
oh well.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There already are two capabilities for the audit subsystem
(<tt>CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL</tt> and <tt>CAP_AUDIT_WRITE</tt>) but, as Paul
Moore <a href="/Articles/740748/">explained</a>, neither is quite right to
govern the ability to register container IDs:
<div class="BigQuote">
CAP_AUDIT_WRITE exists to control which applications can submit
userspace generated audit records to the kernel, CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL
exists to control which applications can manage the in-kernel audit
configuration (e.g. filter rules) and the current task's loginuid
value.  Reusing CAP_AUDIT_WRITE here would allow any application that
can submit userspace audit records the ability to change the audit
container ID; this would be bad, we don't allow CAP_AUDIT_WRITE to
change the loginuid, it would be even worse to allow it to change the
audit container ID.  Reusing CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL is less worse than than
CAP_AUDIT_WRITE, but it gets sticky once we get to the part where we
want to auditd instances in containers, complete with their own
queues, filtering rules, etc..  Perhaps we could use CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL
to guard the audit container ID value, but we would always want to do
that check in the init userns in order to prevent container bound
processes from manipulating their own audit container ID.
</div>
</p>

<p>
James Bottomley <a href="/Articles/740750/">suggested</a> sidestepping the
capability question by making the container ID a write-once attribute; once
set, nothing could change it.  The idea of nested containers came up
several times, though, which would require some way to change these
container IDs. 
Bottomley suggested simply to allow appending to the container ID, so that
the hierarchy is inherent in the chain of IDs. Moore <a
href="/Articles/740762/">agreed</a> that write-once would work for the
non-nested case:
<div class="BigQuote">
Richard [Briggs] and I have talked about a write once approach, but the
thinking was that you may want to allow a nested container
orchestrator (Why? I don't know, but people always want to do the
craziest things.) and a write-once policy makes that impossible.  If
we punt on the nested orchestrator, I believe we can seriously think
about a write-once policy to simplify things.
</div>
</p>

<p>
But  Aleksa Sarai <a href="/Articles/740763/">pointed out</a> that nested
containers are a fairly common use case, for LXC system containers in
particular (which will often have other container runtimes running inside
them).  Biederman <a href="/Articles/740764/">noted</a> that there is not,
as yet, a solution for running the audit daemon in containers, so it may be
premature to worry about nested container IDs at this point.
</p>

<p>
Schaufler is <a href="/Articles/740765/">concerned</a> that adding an ID
for auditing containers is heading 
down the wrong path.  He suggested the <a href="/Articles/702639/">ptags
Linux Security Module</a> as a way forward; it would 
allow arbitrary tags 
with values to be set for a process.
<div class="BigQuote">
Then you want Jose Bollo's PTAGS. It's insane to add yet another
arbitrary ID to the task for a special purpose. Add a general tagging
mechanism instead. We could add a gazillion new id's, each with [its]
own capability if we head down this road.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Moore <a href="/Articles/740766/">stressed</a> that the effort was not
aimed at a more general mechanism, but simply to address the needs of the
audit subsystem at this point.  He said that the ID is meant to be an
"<q>audit container ID</q>" and not a more general "<q>container
ID</q>".  Using the audit ID for other purposes risks opening up
problems in other areas (such as container migration), so he and Briggs are
attempting to restrict the use cases.
<div class="BigQuote">
 We would love to have a generic kernel facility that the
audit subsystem could use to identify containers, but we don't, and
previous attempts have failed, so we have to create our own.  We are
intentionally trying to limit its scope in an attempt to limit
problems.  If a more general solution appears in the future I think we
would make every effect to migrate to that; keeping this initial
effort small should make that easier.
</div>
</p>

<p>
At this point, there is no code on the table, it is purely a discussion on
where things should go.  Adding a new capability for registering these IDs
seems to be a non-starter; the write-once scheme governed by one of the
existing audit capabilities seems like it might plausibly pass muster.
Though, as Moore said, there seems to be a bigger need here, but more general
solutions have so far been hard to come by.  Adding IDs willy-nilly may
be suboptimal but, until something more general comes along, might just be
the right way forward.

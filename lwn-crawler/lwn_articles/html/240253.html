Len Brown can only be a glutton for punishment; he is, after all, the
maintainer of the Linux ACPI subsystem.  That is a difficult position to be in:
ACPI involves getting into the BIOS layer, an area of system software which
is not always known for careful, high-quality work.  Supporting ACPI is a
complex task which, among other things, requires the embedding of a
specialized interpreter within the kernel, a hard sell at best.  Even with

<a href="/Articles/240335/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/ols2007/LenBrown-sm.jpg"
width=150 height=166 alt="[Len Brown]" align="right" border=0></a>

that background in mind, one must wonder just how much masochism is
required to lead one to deliver three separate talks at the 2007 Ottawa
Linux Symposium.  That is just what Len did, however; the end result was a
good view into several aspects of the power management problem.
<p>
<h3>Getting more from tickless</h3>
<p>
The first talk (on the tickless kernel) was supposed to be given by Suresh
Siddha, who was unable to attend the event.  The <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/223185/">dynamic tick patches</a> have been
covered here before.  Suresh/Len's talk was not really about how these
patches work, but, instead, about the work which remains to be done to take
full advantage of the tickless design.  It seems that the work which has
been done so far is just the beginning.
<p>

The problem is that, on a system used by Suresh and company, the average
processor sleep time was still less than 1ms even after the dynamic tick
code was enabled.  Given that one of the driving reasons for dynamic tick
was to let the processor sleep for long periods of time - thus saving power
- this is a disappointing result.  It turns out that there is a lot which
can be done to improve the situation, though.
<p>

Step number one is to address a kernel-space problem: there are a lot of
active kernel timers which tend to spread out over time.  As a result,
the kernel wakes up much more often than it would if the timers were
sufficiently well 
coordinated to expire at the same time whenever possible.  As it
happens, many kernel timers do not need great precision; a timer which
fires some number of milliseconds later than scheduled is not a problem.
So, if the kernel could defer some timers to fire at the same time as
others, it can reduce the number of wakeups.  The <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/228143/">deferrable timers</a> patch does
exactly that; the <tt>round_jiffies()</tt> function added in 2.6.19 can
also help the kernel line up events.  Adding this code brought the average
sleep time up to 20ms, with the system handling 90 interrupts per second.
<p>

Next is the problem of hardware timers.  On the i386 architecture, the
preferred timer is the local APIC (LAPIC) timer, which is built into the
processor and very fast to program.  Unfortunately, putting the processor
into a deep sleep also puts the LAPIC timer to sleep, a situation Len
compared to unplugging one's alarm clock before going to bed.  In either
case, oversleeping can be the unwanted result.  The programmable interval
timer (PIT) remains awake and is easily used, but it has a maximum event
time of 27ms.  If one wants the processor to sleep for longer than that,
another solution must be found.  That solution is the high-precision event
timer (HPET), which has a maximum interval of at least three seconds.
Getting access to the HPET can be hard, though; good BIOS support is spotty
at best and the HPET is often disabled.  If it can be forced on, however,
the system can go to an average sleep period of about 56ms, handling 32
interrupts per second.
<p>

Even better is to get the HPET out of the "legacy mode" currently used by
Linux.  This mode is simple to use, but it requires the rebroadcasting of
timer interrupts on multiprocessor systems.  But the HPET can work with
per-CPU channels, eliminating this problem.  The result: average sleep time
grows to 74ms.
<p>

At this point, the problem moves to user space.  Since the release of <a
href="http://www.linuxpowertop.org/">powertop</a>, there has been a lot of
progress in this area; user-space applications which cause frequent wakeups
unnecessarily stand out immediately and can be fixed.  But, as Len noted,
"user space still sucks."  
<p>

<h3>ACPI myths</h3>
<p>

One gets  the sense that Len is a little tired  of people complaining
about ACPI in Linux.  His response was a talk on "ten ACPI myths" - though
the list had grown to twelve by then.
<p>
<b>#1: There is no benefit to enabling ACPI</b>.  Len's answer to this had
two parts, the first of which being that, increasingly, there is no
alternative.  The older APM interface is deprecated, and, in particular,
Microsoft's Vista has removed APM support altogether.  So, soon, there will
be no hardware support for APM at all; it is a dead standard.  The MPS
standard (used for discovering processors) is also old and dying.  Like it
or not, ACPI is needed to be able to make use of one's hardware.
<p>
On the positive side, using ACPI gives better access to hardware features
like software-enabled power, sleep, and lid buttons.  Smart battery status
information becomes available, as well as the potential for reduced power
consumption and better battery life.  True hotplug and (especially) docking
support also become possible with ACPI.
<p>

<b>#2: Suspend-to-disk problems are ACPI's fault</b>.  In fact, ACPI is a
very small part of the suspend-to-disk process - everything else is in
other parts of the kernel code.  If you have suspend-to-disk problems,
suggests Len, "complain to Pavel [Machek], not me."
<p>

<b>#3: If the extra buttons don't work, it's ACPI's fault</b>.  The issue
here is that support for "hotkeys" is not actually a part of the ACPI
specification.  All of those extra buttons found on laptops are
vendor-specific added features.  The reverse-engineered drivers currently
found in the kernel are a "heroic effort," but they should not be
necessary.  Vendors should be supplying drivers for their hardware.
<p>

<b>#4: Boot problems with ACPI enabled are ACPI's fault</b>.  Len allows
that this one might just be true some of the time.  But disabling ACPI at
boot-time also disables other hardware features - the IO-APIC in
particular.  So any problems associated with those other parts of the
system will be masked by turning off ACPI.  It looks like ACPI was the
actual problem, but the truth is more complicated.
<p>

<b>#5: ACPI issues are due to sub-standard platform BIOS</b>.  It turns out
that there are three general sources of ACPI incompatibilities.  Just one
of them is the BIOS violating the ACPI specification; incompatibilities
which don't break Windows will often slip through the testing process.  The
<a href="http://www.linuxfirmwarekit.org/">firmware developer kit</a>
produced by Intel can help in this regard.  Another source of problems is
differing interpretations of the specification, which is a long and complex
document.  The Linux ACPI developers have been working to help clarify the
specification when this sort of problem arises.  Finally, there can also
simply be bugs in the Linux-specific code.
<p>

<b>#6: The Linux community cannot help to improve the ACPI
specification</b>.  In fact, the ACPI team has been submitting
improvements, mostly in the form of "specification clarifications."  Many
of those have been incorporated and shipped with specification updates.
<p>

<b>#7: The ACPI code changes a lot but is not getting better</b>.  Intel
has put together a test suite with over 2000 tests; ACPI changes must now
pass that suite before being merged.  The number of new bug reports has
been dropping - though, perhaps, more slowly than one might like.
<p>

<b>#8: ACPI is slow and bad for high-performance CPU governors</b>.  The
ACPI interpreter is not used in performance-critical paths, and, thus,
cannot be slowing things down.  ACPI's role is in the setup and
configuration process.
<p>

<b>#9: The speedstep-centrino governor is faster than acpi-cpufreq</b>.
The acpi-cpufreq governor has seen considerable improvements, and is now able
to access MSRs in a fast and (more importantly) supportable way. So its
performance is where it should be, and the speedstep-centrino governor is
scheduled for removal.
<p>

<b>#10: More CPU idle power states is better</b>.  This may be true for any
given processor, but you cannot compare processors on the basis of how many
idle states they provide.  All that really matters is how much power you
save when you use those states.
<p>

<b>#11: Processor throttling will save energy</b>.  The problem here is a
confusion of "power" and "energy."  A throttled processor may draw less
power, but it has to run longer to accomplish the same work.  So throttling
the processor (while maintaining the same voltage) may have the effect of
increasing energy use rather than reducing it.  The better approach is
almost always to run at the fastest clock frequency afforded by the current
voltage level and get the work done quickly; Len characterized this as the
"race to idle."  
<p>
There are second-order effects to consider; in particular, batteries will
last longer if they are discharged over longer periods of time.  A
throttled processor may also run cooler, allowing fans to be turned off.
Throttling may be necessary for temperature regulation.  But, from an
energy-savings perspective, these are truly second-order effects.

<p>
<b>#12: I can't contribute to improving ACPI in Linux</b>.  Like any other
project, Linux ACPI would love to have more developers.  And, failing that,
one can always test kernels and report bugs.  There is, in reality, plenty
of opportunity for improving the ACPI code.
<p>

<h3>Cool-hand Linux</h3>
<p>

Len's final talk moved away from power consumption toward its effects - the
generation of heat, in particular.  The creation of excess heat is not a
welcome behavior in any device, but it becomes especially undesirable in
handheld devices.  Devices which make the user's hand sweat are less fun to
use; those which get too hot to hold comfortably can be entirely unusable.
So temperature management is important.  But the nature of these devices
can make thermal regulation tricky: there's no room for fans in a
Linux-powered cellular phone, and  the dissipation of heat can be hard
in general.  
<p>

The ACPI 3.0 specification includes a complicated thermal model.  The
device is divided up into zones, and each component has its thermal
contribution to each zone characterized.  Implementing this specification
is a complex and difficult task - enough so that the Linux ACPI developers
have no intention of doing it.  They will, instead, focus on something
simpler.
<p>

That something is the ACPI 2.0 thermal model.  It includes thermal zones,
each of which comes with temperature sensors and a set of trip points.
The "critical shutdown" trip point is set somewhere just short of where the
device begins to melt; should things get that warm, the device just needs
to turn itself off as quickly as possible.  Various other trip points
will be encountered first; they should bring about increasingly strong
measures for controlling temperature.  These can include turning on fans
(if they exist), throttling devices, or suspending the system to disk.
ACPI 2.0 includes an embedded controller which monitors the system's
temperature sensors and sends events to the CPU when something interesting
happens. 
<p>

The in-progress thermal regulation code just uses the existing critical
shutdown mechanism built into ACPI.  There is also support for some of the
passive trip points which bring about CPU throttling.  For the
non-processor thermal zones, though, the best thing to do is to let user
space figure out how to respond, so that's what the ACPI code will do.
There will be a netlink interface through which temperature events can be
sent, and a set of sysfs directories for reading sensor values.  The sysfs
tree will also include control files which can be used by a user-space
daemon to throttle specific devices in response to temperature events.  
<p>

In the end, the kernel is really just a conduit, conducting events and
control settings between the components of the device and user space.
There were some questions on whether there will be a standardized set of
sysfs knobs for every device; the answer appears to be "no."  Each device
is different, with its own control parameters; it is hard to create any
sort of standard which can describe them all.  Beyond that, the target
environment is embedded devices, each of which is unique.  It is expected
that each device will have its own special-purpose management daemon
designed especially for it, so there is no real benefit in trying to make
things generic.

<p>

The impression one gets from all these talks is that quite a bit is
happening in the power management area - a part of Linux which, for some
time, has been seen as falling short of what it really needs to be.  The
increasing use of Linux in embedded systems can only help in this regard;
there are a number of vendors who have a strong interest in improved
support for intelligent use of power.  Given time and continued work, power
management may soon be one of those past problems which is no longer an
issue.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The biggest culprit for me in powertop is still the wifi bits in the kernel.  Unless I turn off the wifi from the hardware switch, my laptop never gets down to C3 at all.  I don't have another laptop handy, but I'm curious: Is this a usual side effect of wifi, or is this a bug that should be reported?<br>

      I you look at this powertop page[1] you will see it says <blockquote><b>Xorg shows up high on the hall-of-shame list</b><br />
Xorg generally does work on behalf of other programs, so if Xorg shows up high on the list, there are other programs that make it do work on your system. In our experiments with an "ultra idle" Linux graphical desktop, Xorg is indeed not showing any activity.</blockquote>
So it is not X that is the problem - it is a proggy that is causing X to wake up that needs a slapping.<br /><br/>

      Strange, my new Fujutsu Siemens Amilo Si 1520 spends 98% of its time in C3 with the CPU throttled down to 1GHz (with the system idle).<br>
<p>
Powertop reports that the cpu gets around 300 wakeups pr. second, which I thought was quite bad, so I tried the tickless kernel and that went down to around 100wakeups/s.<br>
<p>
I can't complain though, even with a full kernel compile on battery (that tickless kernel) I still got slightly more than 4.5 hours of runtime.<br>

      Len Brown is my personal hero.  As "Mr. ACPI", he gets a ration of crap <br>
from lots of kernel developers yet manages to take it all in stride.  <br>
Plus, he has a dry wit that is second to none -- his talks are highly <br>
recommended for their entertainment value alone.<br>
<p>
Len's talks (both this year and previously) have greatly heightened my <br>
understanding of the how and why of power (and now thermal) management.  <br>
With the increased prevalence of Linux in mobile devices, I hope Len and <br>
others continue to get this message out to those (like me) that need to <br>
take an interest.  Even if ACPI is not your bag, these issues are <br>
increasingly important in devices of all types and architectures.<br>

      Len has an affect-free delivery that let you get halfway into the next sentence before noticing that something very funny or, occasionally, very biting has been said. His talks would be worthwhile, anyway, for their technical depth and insight, but the humor definitely is a plus.<br>
<p>
Also, thanks to Len for hosting a Power-Management Summit preceding OLS, fostering some interesting and useful discussion of needs and directions.<br>

      "So, soon, there will be no hardware support for APM at all; it is a dead standard."<br>
<p>
Nitpick/correction: soon, there will be no *new* hardware support for APM anymore. Old APM hardware will still exist, and people will still want to run Linux on it. Not everyone's using the latest and greatest all the time.<br>

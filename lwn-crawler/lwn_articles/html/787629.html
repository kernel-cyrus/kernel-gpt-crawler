The <tt>mmap_sem</tt> lock used in the memory-management subsystem has been
a known scalability problem for years, but it has proved difficult to
remove.  No less than three sessions were held during the memory-management
track of the 2019 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit to talk about
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> and how it might be eliminated.  Many ideas were
discussed, but the shape of the solution remains vague at best.

<p>
<h4>Maple trees</h4>
<p>
The first session, run by Laurent Dufour and
Matthew Wilcox, discussed a possible solution: replacing the red-black tree
currently used to track virtual memory areas (VMAs) with a new data
structure called a "maple tree".
<p>
VMAs represent the regions of memory that make up a process's address
space.  They are kept in an <a href="/Articles/388118/">augmented red-black
tree</a> that exists to answer two kinds of queries: quickly finding the
VMA associated with a given address, or finding a gap in the address space

<a href="/Articles/787632/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/WillyLaurent-sm.jpg" alt="[Matthew Wilcox]"
title="Matthew Wilcox" class="lthumb"></a>

that is large enough to hold a new VMA.  There is also a separate linked
list that contains the VMAs in an address space, making it possible to walk
through the entire space.  Either way, protection of those data structures
is done with <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  Wilcox noted that doubly linked lists have
come under a lot of criticism in recent years; they are "the devil's
structure" with poor performance characteristics.  The current structure
for VMAs, he said, is a "quintuply linked list" with even worse
performance.
<p>
Naturally (since he is the creator of the XArray structure), Wilcox wanted
to replace everything with an XArray.  It is, he said, "absolutely superb"
for the page cache, with all the properties one might want for looking
up pages with a 2<sup>n</sup>-byte alignment.  But the XArray lacks good range
support, which is what is needed here; there is no way to search for gaps
in the address space.  It is, thus, not a good structure for this task.
<p>
So, instead, he suggests using maple trees, a data structure he has been
working on with Liam Howlett.  It is a form of B-tree that has been
optimized for storing ranges that lack significant gaps, which is just what
the VMA list is.  VMAs are mostly adjacent, he said, with a relatively
small number of gaps between them.  Hugh Dickins predicted that somebody
was sure to post a patch in the near future that spread out VMAs as a
hardening measure; Wilcox responded that the structure could be tweaked
accordingly if that ever happens.
<p>
One of the key features of the new structure is lockless access to VMAs, a
claim that brought an immediate protest from Mel Gorman, who worried that it
could never be safe.  One of the core aspects of the VMA, he said, is that
it is actually two data structures in disguise.  One of them is the VMA
itself; the other is the <tt>address_space</tt> structure describing what
that range of memory actually maps to.  The two structures have their own
life cycles and locking schemes, and lockless access will be hazardous at
best.  It might be necessary to add some sort of reference counter to the
address space to keep it from going away while the VMA is being worked on.
<p>
That, Wilcox said, is why this discussion was happening; it would allow the
developers to get a sense for what the end state would look like.
Meanwhile, while the maple tree conversion is happening, code will continue

<a href="/Articles/787632/"><img
src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2019/lsfmm/WillyLaurent-sm2.jpg" alt="[Laurent Dufour]"
title="Laurent Dufour" class="rthumb"></a>



to use <tt>mmap_sem</tt> to access the data structure.  There are two
phases to this work: replacing the data structure with something more
efficient, and separating out the locking.
<p>
Andrea Arcangeli said that it might be better to do things in the opposite
order, and find ways to fix the locking first.  For example, he said there
should be no need to use <tt>mmap_sem</tt> with <tt>VM_GROWSDOWN</tt> VMAs
(those representing stack areas, normally).  It can also be avoided for
calls to <tt>get_user_pages_fast()</tt>.  The complexity of the code may be
increased by removing the locking first, but he said that it was pointless
to try to change the two things together.  It is better to change the
locking first; otherwise you can't really even benchmark the results of the
other changes.
<p>
Michal Hocko was unsure about changing the locking first, but he liked the
idea of getting rid of the doubly linked list and doing lockless searches.
This work could also help, he said, with range locking, which is a commonly
suggested way of reducing contention on <tt>mmap_sem</tt>.  Rather than
using <tt>mmap_sem</tt> to lock the entire range, taking a range lock
on just the part of the address space being worked on would allow more to
happen in parallel.  He asked: how much work is needed to make this happen?
<p>
Wilcox replied that the patch, so far, is about 2,000 lines of code, but
it's addressing more than just the VMA problem.  There are three users of
radix trees for ranges; all are horrible, he said, and should be replaced.
There are other places using red-black trees that could be improved as
well.  In the end, this work will give him the opportunity to delete a lot
of code.  The maple tree structure will be there anyway,
regardless of whether it is used for VMAs.  Hocko said that was a good
argument for using it with VMAs too.
<p>
At the end of the session, the next steps were laid out.  Some sort of
per-VMA locking will be set up, probably based on a range lock.
Hocko suggested that the range locking should happen first, since adding
range locks is a huge step.  There are many places where <tt>mmap_sem</tt>
is abused to protect other data structures; it will take a long time just
to figure out where they all are.  Gorman suggested that all
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> users should be changed to acquire a lock on the entire
address-space range; after that, each use can be evaluated to see if it can
be narrowed.  That will allow some sort of incremental progress.  This task
is, he said, "the big kernel lock all over again".

<p>
<h4>Range locks</h4>
<p>
Wilcox led a session on the following day dedicated to range locks in
particular.  Range locking is, he said, "a very seductive idea".  There is
a highly contended lock getting in the way, so it is natural to want to
split it up.  After all, the kernel doesn't use one big lock for access to
inodes; instead, each inode has its own lock.  Something similar has
obvious appeal for the memory-management subsystem.
<p>
Davidlohr Bueso has done <a href="/Articles/724502/">a range-lock
implementation</a> for the kernel that stores ranges in a <a
href="/Articles/184495/">red-black tree</a>.  But, Wilcox said, he is not a
big fan of red-black trees; he has a replacement to propose (presumably the
maple tree) that should perform better, but it is not working yet.  That
said, he is also not a fan of range locks, which he finds inelegant.  They
use one complicated data structure to protect another; in this case, one
red-black tree (the range locks) is being used to protect another red-black
tree (containing the VMAs).  It
would be better, he said, to build the locking into the tree itself.
<p>
There is some data to back this up.
Dave Chinner tried to use range locks to improve XFS, Wilcox said, and
ended up with a significant slowdown.  Mel Gorman protested, though, that
Chinner's experiment used an XFS-specific range lock that managed extents;
it is not an equivalent situation, he said.
<p>
Wilcox then admitted that he did not have a whole lot else to say.  Gorman
said that it would be great to have a lock in each VMA, but that is a lot
harder to do for holes in the address space.  No object exists there yet,
so there is nothing to put a lock into.  But evidently the DAX subsystem
has a solution to that problem now, inserting locked entries into holes in the
radix tree.  Wilcox is planning something similar for VMAs, but there is no
code yet so it is too early to talk about now.
<p>
At this point, this relatively short session came to a close.
<p>
<h4>mmap_sem again</h4>
<p>
At the very end of the conference, Dufour ran one more session
with the desultory title of "<tt>mmap_sem</tt> again".  It was ostensibly
about the <a href="/Articles/730531/">speculative page faults</a> work,
though it did not focus much on that work specifically.
<p>
One purpose of <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is to protect VMAs against concurrent
changes.  That could perhaps be replaced in a twofold manner: a lock to
protect the list of VMAs (perhaps using read-copy-update), and a lock
embedded in each individual VMA.  The latter lock would have to be a
sleeping lock, 
since it must be taken while handling page faults.  That leads immediately
to the first challenge: how does one go from the non-sleeping lock
protecting the list to the sleeping lock for the VMA?  Acquiring the first
lock will normally invoke a context where sleeping is no longer an option.
<p>
There was some talk of using reference counts for this purpose; Wilcox
described it as "open-coding a semaphore".  Gorman said there would have to
be a wait queue for anybody who needs to wait for the reference count to go
to zero.  Starvation could become an issue in some settings.  He also
advised against using RCU, which is only useful when getting a copy of an
object is sufficient; that is never true for VMAs.  There would need to be
a convincing explanation of how all this is 
actually better than <tt>mmap_sem</tt>, he said.
<p>
Jérôme Glisse suggested adding counts to the VMA so that all faults could
be handled speculatively.  But Gorman argued against building on the
speculative page-fault code, which has yet to produce any performance gain
in any of his tests.  Glisse said that he was only thinking about taking
parts of it to check for concurrent changes to a VMA while other work is
going on.  He would like to avoid range locking, he said; instead, the
page-table locks can function as a sort of natural range lock.

Hocko disagreed with the idea that range locks should be avoided.  An
address space is a collection of ranges that the memory-management
subsystem operates on, so a range lock is a natural solution to the
problem.
<p>
Wilcox turned the discussion back to <tt>mmap_sem</tt>, noting that it is
highly contended and wondering how it could be split up.  Part of the
problem, he said, is that <tt>mmap_sem</tt> "covers many sins" beyond the
protection of VMAs.  Once that is dealt with, though, everybody agrees that
work needs to be separated by range; that is not the point of contention.
Instead, the dispute centers around whether Bueso's range locks, in
particular, should be used.
<p>
For a next step, Glisse brought back the idea of replacing
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> with a wrapper that would lock the entire range; Wilcox
responded that this approach was "crazy".  His own next step is moving
unrelated data out from under <tt>mmap_sem</tt> to simplify the problem.
Meanwhile, he is continuing to work on the maple tree concept as an
independent effort.  He also said that working on speculative page faults
is valuable, even if it yields no immediate performance benefits; it helps
the developers discover the perils that come with splitting up
<tt>mmap_sem</tt> in general.  Dufour agreed that he had already learned
far more than he had ever wanted while working on that code; he is not sure
about the future of speculative page faults but hopes that it can help to
get to a more scalable memory-management subsystem.
<p>
Dave Hansen complained that <tt>mmap_sem</tt> is a heavyweight lock, even
when just acquired for reading.  It bounces its reference count around the
system, creating a lot of cache misses.  Adding a reference count to the
VMA structure would, he said, just move the problem.  Dufour said that the
current practice of merging VMAs whenever possible might be making things
worse by increasing contention on the locks; perhaps merging should not be
done so aggressively.
<p>
The session was coming to an end, and the participants were clearly tired
after three days of this kind of discussion.  Hocko said that the group
should at least come up with an action item.  The goal is to replace
<tt>mmap_sem</tt>; if developers don't like range locks, then what would
they suggest using instead?  It needs to be something that, like range
locks, can turn the <tt>mmap_sem</tt> replacement into an incremental
problem so that the transition is manageable.  The focus should be on the
new API, he said; once that is sane, developers can work on the
implementation.
<p>
The problem, Wilcox countered, is that the range-lock API doesn't work for
this problem.  Code often does not know the size of the range it needs when
it takes the lock, so it ends up locking the entire region, then
downgrading to something smaller.  But locking everything for every fault
sounds a lot like <tt>mmap_sem</tt>, and downgrading will be an extra
expense on top of that.  Hocko asked what the alternative was, if there is
not an API to start with, but no definitive answer was at hand.  As the
session concluded, Gorman said that one action item would be to get Bueso
to repost the work he as done so far; perhaps there are some lessons to be
learned from it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      The <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/multicore/radixvm/">RadixVM research paper</a> a few years back did a proof-of-concept of a scalable VM system in a Unix-like kernel based on radix trees. Adapting those ideas to the full Linux kernel would undoubtedly be a ton of work, but I was a bit surprised to not see a mention.

My experiments with range locks should not be dismissed just because I used "an xfs specific btree" to back the range lock or that it was used to track IO ranges. I've since implemented a generic btree with optimistic lock coupling (i.e. lockless lookups, and fine-grained per-node, full 64 bit range, scales to tens of millions of concurrent random lookup/insert/delete ops per second on trees containing millions of records across 16p) to get rid of the mutex that limited range lock scalability. <br>
<p>
However, I'm getting the /almost identical results/ for the OBT as with the mutex protected XFS specific btree backing the range locks. The OBT range lock is a bit faster than both the XFS specific btree and a rwsem at 4 threads, but it's not scaling to 8 threads like a rwsem does in my IO experiments.<br>
<p>
Basically, the problem with tree-based range locks is that as long as you only have a few locks being held you cannot make lock/unlock operations concurrent because non-overlapping (i.e. fast path) range locks are essentially 100% modification workload. Hence on a small tree they all hit the same node(s) and that quickly becomes, like a rwsem, a cacheline bouncing bound operation. This is by far the most important thing I've learnt from these experiments so far.<br>
<p>
You can see this easily with AIO: you might be submitting 128 IOs per syscall and have them all in progress at once, but this still only means the lock depth is only 1 because we only lock the inode over AIO submission. And submission is serialised. Hence by the time you get to 8+ threads all submitting hundreds of AIO at once, the range lock depth is still only 8, and so it's still a single tree node they bang on, hence contend on a single cacheline just like a rwsem or a mutex protected single threaded tree.<br>
<p>
IOWs, generic range locking turns out to be /really hard to scale/ and so you can't just replace a rwsem with a tree-based range lock and expect it to go lots faster. For some cases it will be better, but for just as many it will be no better or significantly worse because small trees will still hit the single contended cacheline wall....<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 15, 2020</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/776703/">io_uring subsystem</a> is not much over one
year old, having been merged for the 5.1 kernel in May 2019.  It was
initially added as a better way to perform asynchronous 
I/O from user space; over time it has gained numerous features and support
for functionality beyond just moving bits around.  What it has not yet gained
is any sort of security mechanism beyond what the kernel already provides
for the underlying system calls.  That may be about to change, though, as
the result of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200710141945.129329-1-sgarzare@redhat.com/">this
patch set</a> from Stefano Garzarella adding a set of user-configurable
restrictions to io_uring.
<p>
As one might expect from its name, io_uring is based around a ring
buffer shared between the kernel and user space that
allows user space to submit operations to the kernel. There is a second
ring that is filled
with the results of those operations.  Each operation can be thought of as
a way of expressing a system call; operations may read or write buffers,
open files, send network messages, or request any of <a
href="/Articles/810414/">a number of other actions</a>.  Operations can be
made contingent on the successful completion of previous operations.  In
short, the operation stream feeding into the kernel is a sort of language
expressing a program that the kernel should execute asynchronously.
<p>
Operations executed by io_uring result in calls to the code within the
kernel that implements the corresponding system calls; an
<tt>IORING_OP_READV</tt> operation, for example, ends up in the same place
as a <tt>readv()</tt> system call.  That code will
perform the usual privilege checks, using the credentials of the process
that created the ring in the first place.  So, in the absence of bugs, a
process can do nothing with io_uring that it would not be allowed to do
with direct system calls — with the exception that <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>
filters do not apply to io_uring.  This model has worked well for io_uring
so far, 
but it turns out that there is a use case that could use a bit more
control.
<p>
In particular, what happens if a process wants to create a ring and hand it
over to another, less-trusted process?  For example, I/O from within
virtualized guests 
could perhaps be accelerated considerably if it used io_uring.  This I/O,
which often goes through the <a
href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">Virtio</a> mechanism now,
involves a certain amount of data copying and context shifting that could
be avoided this way.  The
hypervisor could create whatever file descriptors the client would need,
which would correspond to specific devices or open network connections,
then let the 
guest handle things directly through the ring from there.
<p>

The problem with this idea is that the guest could then perform <i>any</i>
operation that io_uring supports.  Remember that the ring retains the
credentials of the creator, which would be the hypervisor in this case;
giving such a ring to a client would open the door to actions like
accessing other file descriptors opened by the hypervisor or opening new files
with the hypervisor's credentials.  This is likely to prove extremely
disappointing to anybody counting on virtualization as a security barrier.

<p>
The answer to this problem, according to Garzarella, is to allow the
registration of restrictions on what a specific ring can do.  He adds a new
opcode (<tt>IORING_REGISTER_RESTRICTIONS</tt>) for this purpose.  There are
a few types of restrictions that can be added:
<p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>IORING_RESTRICTION_REGISTER_OP</tt></dt>
<dd> Provides a list of registration operations that can be carried out
     with this ring.  Registration operations install file descriptors and
     buffers in the ring, optimizing their use in subsequent operations.
     These are, in other words, setup operations for the ring itself that
     do not actually      perform I/O.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>IORING_RESTRICTION_SQE_OP</tt></dt>
<dd> The operations (actual system calls) that will be allowed in this ring
     are provided as a list.  It's called a "whitelist" within the code, a
     term that seems more than usually likely to change before the patches
     find their way into the mainline.  Any operation that does not appear
     in this list will be disallowed on the restricted ring.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>IORING_RESTRICTION_FIXED_FILES_ONLY</tt></dt>
<dd> If this restriction is applied, only file descriptors that have been
     previously registered in the ring can be used in operations.  In other
     words, this restriction can be used to limit a ring to operating on a
     specific set of known files.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
Most of the "restrictions" above are thus actually permissions; they
specify the things that the ring is allowed to do.  Among other things, the
allowlist approach here will help prevent future surprises when new
operations are inevitably added to the io_uring roster.  Restrictions can
be applied exactly once, after which they are fixed for as long as the ring
exists.
<p>
One final piece, <a
href="/ml/io-uring/f7f2841e-3dbb-377f-f8f8-826506a938a6@kernel.dk/">suggested</a>
by io_uring maintainer Jens Axboe in response to a previous version of the
patch set, is a new flag (<tt>IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED</tt>) that can be
provided when the ring is first created.  When present, that flag causes
the ring to start in a disabled state; registration operations will still
succeed, but any other operations will fail.  That allows the ring creator
to perform the necessary registrations and add restrictions without having
to worry about any other thread starting to use the ring for I/O.  Once the
registration phase is complete, the <tt>IORING_REGISTER_ENABLE_RINGS</tt>
registration operation will complete the ring setup and enable all
(allowed) operations.
<p>
This restrictions mechanism appears to be sufficient for the described use
case of allowing restricted access to a specific set of file descriptors.
It seems probable that somebody will want to add more
sophisticated policy mechanisms at some point; a proposal to add a BPF hook
for security decisions seems unavoidable.  For the near future, though, the
proposed restriction mechanism may help to speed up I/O in virtual machines
or other untrusted environments, which seems like a useful improvement.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Interesting that seccomp() filters do not apply in io_uring. Does this mean that a process restricted under seccomp() could potentially execute prohibited system calls via io_uring?<br>

Interesting, thanks for the response. <br>
<p>
I noticed that Docker&#x27;s default seccomp profile (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/">https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/</a>) doesn&#x27;t prevent io_uring inside containers. Looks like most of the syscalls it prevents are already gated by capabilities, but it&#x27;d be interesting to see if you could circumvent anything with io_uring.<br>

      <p>That link is out-dated and it's written as though the Docker seccomp configuration is a denylist rather than an allowlist -- it's the latter (anything else would be insecure). The correct source to use would be <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/seccomp_default.go">the source code for the default profile</a> -- but it does turn out that they enabled support for io_uring last year and there wasn't much discussion on whether this would cause issues in the future.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, io_uring only allows certain syscall-like operations to be done through it and they are all also permitted in the default seccomp profile (in both Docker and LXD) so there really isn't a change in security policy. However as io_uring gains more features we may have to revisit this.</p>

Thanks cyphar, good to know. I imagine disabling io_uring (whether in a container or not) is not preferable due to its overall utility, however I imagine the patch mentioned in the article will be useful in cases like this and especially so if io_uring trends toward becoming more generic. <br>

It may be a bit late for the yearly predictions, but I think once sharp edges like these are fixed in io_uring there&#x27;s going to be an inflection point where post-libc languages flock to it en masse. It has the same “shape” as things like the OpenGL fixed-function to shaders transition, and when I think about it that way it&#x27;s weird that it came as late as it did. Linux&#x27;s async story has historically been a bit dire.<br>

Instead of all this, why not provide a way to transfer ownership of the ring - then all the usual checks would work, right?<br>

This is more like seccomp for io_uring (a single syscall interface that multiplexes many other syscalls). Restrictions are finer-grained than what running a separate process with different credentials achieves.<br>

      <i> giving such a ring to a client would open the door to actions like accessing other file descriptors opened by the hypervisor or opening new files with the hypervisor's credentials</i> <p>

I'm a bit confused on this point.  It seems io_uring operations each include a file descriptor, so surely no matter how the uring was set up they can still only access file descriptors which the process has open (ie. ones passed in, or ones the process is able to open itself).

      First of all, just being able to access the other file descriptors the hypervisor has open would be a hole in its own right.  The hypervisor surely doesn't want to share all of its open files with the client.
<p>
Beyond that, io_uring supports operations like <tt>openat2()</tt>, which will again use the credentials of the hypervisor.

I think the thing I was missing is the guest and the hypervisor, if it&#x27;s like qemu, are in fact the same process so they have the same set of file descriptors.  Thanks.<br>

<p>
Getting interfaces right is a hard, but necessary, task, especially when
that interface 
has to be supported "forever".  Such is the case with the system call
interface that
the kernel presents to user space, so adding features to it must be done
very carefully.  Even so, when Ulrich Drepper set out to <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/236486/">remove a hole that could lead to a
race condition</a>, he probably did not expect all the different paths that
would need to be tried before closing in on an acceptable solution.
</p>

<p>
The problem stems from wanting to be able to create file descriptors with
new properties&mdash;things like close-on-exec, non-blocking, or
non-sequential descriptors.  Those features were not considered when the
system call interface was developed.  After all, many of those system calls
are essentially unchanged from early Unix implementations of the 1970s.
The <tt>open()</tt> call is the most obvious way to request a file descriptor
from the kernel, but there are plenty of others.
</p>

<p>
In fact, <tt>open()</tt> is one of the easiest to extend with new
features because of its <tt>flags</tt> argument.  Calls like
<tt>pipe()</tt>, <tt>socket()</tt>, <tt>accept()</tt>,
<tt>epoll_create()</tt> and others produce file descriptors as well, but don't
have a <tt>flags</tt> argument available.  Something different would have
to be done to support additional features for the file descriptors
resulting from those calls.
</p>

<p>
The close-on-exec functionality is especially important to close a security
hole for multi-threaded programs.  Currently, programs can use 
<tt>fcntl()</tt> to change an open file descriptor to have the close-on-exec property,
but there is always a window in time between the creation of the descriptor and
changing its behavior.  Another thread could do an <tt>exec()</tt> call in
that window, leaking a potentially sensitive file descriptor into the newly
run program.  Closing that window requires an in-kernel solution.
</p>

<p>
Back in June of last year, after some false starts, Linus Torvalds <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/237722/">suggested adding an
<tt>indirect()</tt> system call</a>, as a way to pass flags to system calls
that don't currently support them.  The <tt>indirect()</tt> call would
apply a set of flags to the invocation of an existing system call.  This
would allow existing calls to remain unchanged, with only new uses calling
<tt>indirect()</tt>.  User space programs would be unlikely to call the new
function directly, instead they would call <tt>glibc</tt> functions that
handled any necessary 
<tt>indirect()</tt> calls.
</p>

<p>
Davide Libenzi created a <tt>sys_indirect()</tt> patch in July, but Drepper
saw it as "more complex than warranted".  So Drepper created his own "trivial"
implementation, that was <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/259068/">described on this page</a> in
November.  It was met with a less than enthusiastic response on
linux-kernel for being, amongst other things, an exceedingly ugly
interface.  
</p>

<p>
The alternative to <tt>sys_indirect()</tt> is to create a new system call
for each existing call that needed a flags argument.  This was seen as
messy by some, including Torvalds, leading some kernel hackers into looking for alternatives.  The indirect approach
also had some other potential benefits, though, because it was seen as something that
could be used by <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/261473/">syslets</a> to
allow asynchronous system calls.  No decision seemed to be forthcoming,
leading Drepper to <a href="/Articles/282210/">ask Torvalds for one</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Will you please make a decision regarding sys_indirect?  There has been
no other proposal so the alternative is to add more syscalls.
</div>
</p>

<p>
To bolster his argument that <tt>sys_indirect()</tt> was the way to go,
Drepper also created a <a href="/Articles/282211/">patch to add some of
the required system calls</a>.   He started with the <tt>socket()</tt>
family, by adding <tt>socket4()</tt>, <tt>socketpair5()</tt>, and
<tt>accept4()</tt>&mdash;tacking the number of arguments onto the function
name a la <tt>wait3()</tt> and <tt>wait4()</tt>.   Drepper's intent may not
have been well served by choosing those calls as Alan Cox immediately <a href="/Articles/282212/">noted that the <tt>type</tt> argument could be
overloaded</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Given we will never have 2^32 socket types, and in a sense this is part
of the type why not just use
<pre>
        socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM|SOCK_CLOEXEC, ...)
</pre>
that would be far far cleaner, no new syscalls on the socket side at all.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Michael Kerrisk looked over the set of system calls that generate file
descriptors, <a href="/Articles/282213/">categorizing them based on whether they needed a
flag argument</a> added.  He observed that roughly half of the file
descriptor producing calls need not change because they could either use an
overloading trick like the socket calls, the glibc API already added a
flags argument, or there were alternatives available to provide the same
functionality along with flags.
</p>

<p>
In response, Drepper made one last attempt to push the indirect approach,
<a href="/Articles/282214/">saying</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Or we just add sys_indirect (which is also usable for other syscall
extensions, not just the CLOEXEC stuff) and let userlevel (i.e., me)
worry about adding new interfaces to libc.  As you can see, for the more
recent interfaces like signalfd I have already added an additional
parameter so the number of interface changes would be reduced.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Even though the indirect approach has some good points, Torvalds liked the
approach advocated by Cox, <a href="/Articles/282215/">saying</a>:
<div class="BigQuote">
Ok, I have to admit that I find this very appealing. It looks much
cleaner, but perhaps more importantly, it also looks both readable and
easier to use for the user-space programmer.
</div>

<p>
Ultimately, developers will only use these new interfaces if they can
easily test for the existence of the new code.  Torvalds  <a href="/Articles/282216/">gives an example</a>
of how that might be done using the <tt>O_NOATIME</tt> flag to
<tt>open()</tt>, which has only been available since 2.6.8.  It is this
testability issue that makes him believe the flags-based approach is the
right one:
<div class="BigQuote">
And that's the problem with anything that isn't flags-based. Once you do
new system calls, doing the above is really quite nasty. How do you
statically even test that you have a system call? Now you need to add a
whole autoconf thing for it existing, and when it does exist you still
need to test whether it works, and you can't even do it in the slow-path
like the above (which turns the failure into a fast-path without the
flag).
</div>
</p>

<p>
This new approach, with a scaled down number of new system calls rather
than adding a general-purpose system call extension mechanism like
<tt>sys_indirect()</tt>, is now being pursued by Drepper.  In the <a
href="/Articles/282322/">explanatory patch at the start of the series</a>,
he lays out which 
of the system calls will require a new user space interface: <tt>paccept()</tt>, <tt>epoll_create2()</tt>,
<tt>dup3()</tt>, 
<tt>pipe2()</tt>, and
<tt>inotify_init1()</tt>, as well as those that do not:
<tt>signalfd4()</tt>,
<tt>eventfd2()</tt>,
<tt>timerfd_create()</tt>, 
<tt>socket()</tt>, and
<tt>socketpair()</tt>.

<p>
Drepper has already made
several iterations of patches addressing most of the concerns expressed by
the kernel developers along the way.  There have been some architecture
specific problems, but Drepper has been knocking those down as well.  If no
further roadblocks appear, it would seem a likely candidate for inclusion
in 2.6.27.

Please forgive my obtuseness (obtusity?)... why can't open() be made to do the job of all of
pipe(), socket(), etc., with all the flags and whistles one could want, leaving the

This is very minor -- it was rather disapppointing to see developers being talked about by
last name.  I can only hazard that it's the standard in press, so Edge follows it, but Jon has
always seemed to prefer using first names instead and the result is better (IMVHO).

I concur. The developers don't refer to each other by last name, and are

No it doesn't!  Simple locking between threads would easily fix the race.  See
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=233481">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=233481</a> for an example.  The problem with this
approach appears to be poor performance.

Libraries don't directly call the system; they use the glibc entry points.

However, any possible locking scheme would require that execve() and open()/whatever cannot
run concurrently. It's not hard to construct a program that would be hurt rather severely by
that restriction.

Why not uh.  fork(), then in the child (which calls exec()) call close() to drop the file handle, THEN call exec()?  You know, like normal people?<br>

<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 7, 2011</br>
           </div>
The kernel has always used small integer numbers to represent interrupt
(IRQ) lines internally; those numbers usually correspond to the numbers of
the interrupt lines feeding into the CPU, though it need not be that way.
The kernel has also traditionally used the value zero to indicate that
there is no IRQ assignment at all - except in the places where it hasn't.
That inconsistency has, after many years, popped up to bite the ARM
architecture, with the result that there may have to be a big scramble to
fix things for the 3.3 merge window.
<p>
While the x86 architecture and core interrupt code have used zero for "no
IRQ," various architectures have made other decisions, often using a value
of <tt>-1</tt> instead.  The reason for making such a choice is
straightforward: many architectures have a valid IRQ line numbered zero.
In that situation, a few options present themselves.  That
inconveniently-numbered IRQ can be hidden away where nobody actually sees
it; that is what x86 does on systems where the timer interrupt shows up as
zero.  Another option is to remap that interrupt line to a different number
in software so that IRQ&nbsp;0 never appears outside of the core
architecture code.  Or the architecture can treat zero as a valid IRQ
number and define a symbol like <tt>NO_IRQ</tt> to a different value; a
number of architectures have done that over time, though some have switched
to zero in recent years.  But the ARM architecture still uses -1 as its
<tt>NO_IRQ</tt> value.
<p>
It is worth noting that <tt>NO_IRQ</tt> has been a topic of discussion at
various times over the years.  The earliest appears to have been in
response to <a
href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2005-11/6937.html">this
patch from Matthew Wilcox</a>, posted in 2005.  At that time, Linus <a
href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2005-11/7628.html">made
it clear</a> that he saw zero as the only valid <tt>NO_IRQ</tt> value.  His
reasoning was that code reading:
<p>
<pre>
    if (!dev-&gt;irq)
	/* handle the no-IRQ case */
</pre>
<p>
is easier to read and more efficient to execute than comparisons against
some other value.  Beyond that, IRQ numbers were (and are) represented by
unsigned variables in many parts of the kernel; values like <tt>-1</tt> are
clearly an awkward fit in such situations.  Given that, he said:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	So my suggested (very _strongly_ suggested) solution is for people
	to just consider "irq" to be a cookie, with the magical value 0
	meaning "not there" but no inherent meaning otherwise. That just
	solves all the fundamentally hard problems, and has no fundamental
	problems of its own.
</div>
<p>
In the intervening six years, most architectures have followed that
suggestion, but ARM has not.  That has mattered little thus far, but, as
ARM's popularity grows and the amount of code shared with the rest of the
kernel grows with it, that inconsistency is leading to problems.  Some
recent changes to the device tree code threaten to break ARM entirely (for
some subplatforms, anyway) if things are not changed.
<p>
How hard will things be to fix?  Alan Cox offered <a
href="/Articles/470823/">this suggestion</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I have so little sympathy over this that you'll need a quantum
	physicist to measure it....  You've had years to fix it. If I were
	you I'd delete NO_IRQ from your tree, type make and get it
	done. It's not even a big job to clean it out.
</div>
<p>
As it happens, though, it's not quite that easy.  The core ARM code will
need to remap IRQ&nbsp;0 in places where it is a valid number.  Arguably
the most unpleasant problem, though, was <a
href="/Articles/470824/">pointed out</a> by Dave Martin:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Unfortunately, NO_IRQ is often not spelled "NO_IRQ".  It looks like
	the assumption "irq&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0&nbsp;===&nbsp;no irq" may be
	quite a lot more widespread than "NO_IRQ&nbsp;===&nbsp;no irq".
	Since there's no specific thing we can grep for (and simply due to
	volume) finding all such instances may be quite a bit harder.
</div>
<p>
So it will be necessary to find all of the places where the code assumes
that a negative IRQ number means "no interrupt," places where <tt>-1</tt>
has been hard coded, and so on.  One can argue (as <a
href="/Articles/470826/">ARM maintainer Russell King has</a>) that, as long
as <tt>request_irq(0)</tt> fails and physical IRQ&nbsp;0 is handled
properly, most of that code will do the right thing 
without being changed.  But there is still a fair amount of stuff to clean up.
<p>
Putting it into perspective, though: the work required to fix
<tt>NO_IRQ</tt> in the ARM tree is likely to be tiny relative to the
general cleanup that is happening there.  A bit of churn, some drivers to
fix, and ARM should come into agreement with the rest of the kernel on the
way to indicate a missing interrupt.  That, in turn, will increase
robustness and allow the sharing of more code with the rest of the kernel -
not something to get too terribly irked about.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Wouldn't changing all the places irq's are stored to unsigned allow gcc's -Wsign-compare to point out where (irq &lt; 0) happens?  It seems like this would be fairly straightforward for structures.<br>

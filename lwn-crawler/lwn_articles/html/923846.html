           </div>
As of this writing, 5,776 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the
mainline kernel for the 6.3 release; that is a bit less than half of the
work that was waiting in linux-next before the merge window opened.  This
merge window is thus well underway, but far from complete.  Quite a bit of
significant work has been pulled so far; read on to see what entered the
kernel in the first half of the 6.3 merge window.
<p>
Changes merged to date include:
<p>
<h4>Architecture-specific</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> A large set of old and unused Arm board files <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ff0c7e18629b">has been removed</a>,
     reducing the size of the kernel tree by over 150,000 lines.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7d0d3fa7339e">This (6.0) commit</a>
     describes the list of systems for which board files have been removed. 
     Meanwhile, devicetree files have been added to support <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/950b6662e26e">46 new arm64
     systems</a>.
<li> The new <tt>virtconfig</tt> build target for arm64 systems creates a
     relatively lightweight configuration intended to be booted on virtual
     systems. 
<li> AMD's "automatic IBRS" feature is now supported.  This is a Spectre
     defense that restricts indirect-branch speculation with less of a
     performance cost than that imposed by retpolines.
<li> The m68k architecture has gained support for system-call filtering
     with <a
     href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><tt>seccomp()</tt></a>.
<li> Arm <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/arm64/sme.html">scalable matrix
     extension&nbsp;2</a> instructions are now supported.
<li> BPF trampolines are now fully supported on s390x and RISC-V RV64 systems.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Core kernel</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The list of enhancements to the kernel's embryonic support for the
     Rust language is relatively small this time, but that support is, <a
     href="/ml/linux-kernel/20230212183249.162376-1-ojeda@kernel.org/">according
     to Miguel Ojeda</a>, "<q>getting closer to a point where the first
     Rust modules can be upstreamed</q>".  These changes include the
     removal of a non-applicable part of the alloc crate, an <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9dc043655003">implementation</a> of
     the <a
     href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html">Arc</a> type
     (which provides a reference-counted pointer), the <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4d4692a2ff83">ScopeGuard</a> type
     (which runs some cleanup code when it goes out of scope), and the <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0fc4424d24a2">ForeignOwnable</a>
     type, which facilitates moving pointers between Rust and C code.
<li> There is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/16c294a6aad8">a new
     document</a> covering the stability expectations for BPF kfuncs; it
     describes the current status in <a href="/Articles/921088/">the
     ongoing discussion</a> of how stable the BPF API should be.
<li> The <tt>cgroup.memory=nobpf</tt> command-line parameter disables
     memory accounting for BPF programs; see <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ab86cf337a5b">this merge
     message</a> for a discussion of the motivation behind this feature.
<li> There is a new <a href="/Articles/500355/">red-black tree</a> data
     structure available to BPF programs.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c8ea09974f33">this merge
     message</a> for more information.
<li> The <a href="/Articles/883104/">restartable sequences</a> mechanism
     now exports a "per-memory-map concurrency ID" to processes.  This ID
     can be thought of (and treated like) a CPU number, but the numbers are
     kept as close to zero as possible.  Its purpose is to enable more
     efficient per-CPU data structures in applications that are only using
     a subset of the CPUs on a large system.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/af7f588d8f73">This commit</a>
     contains some more information.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Filesystems and block I/O</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The tmpfs filesystem now supports <a
     href="/Articles/896255/">ID-mapped mounts</a>.
<li> Erofs has gained support for per-CPU file-data decompression, leading
     to reduced data-access latency.
<li> The Btrfs block allocator will now segregate extents by their size, so
     that any given block group is limited to extents that are small
     (less than 128KB), medium (up to 8MB), or large.  This evidently
     reduces fragmentation, especially in workloads where allocation size
     correlates with file lifetime â€” something that evidently actually
     happens.  See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/52bb7a2166af">this
     commit message</a> for some details.
<li> Rotating disk drives still exist, and are even becoming more complex:
     multi-actuator drives have independently controllable arms that, for
     best performance, must all be kept busy.  The BFQ I/O scheduler has
     gained support for such drives; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9778369a2d6c">this commit
     message</a> has a bit more information on how it works.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Hardware support</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
<li> <b>GPIO and pin control</b>:
     Qualcomm QDU1000/QRU1000, IPQ5332, SA8775P, and SM8550 pin controllers,
     Mediatek MT7981 pin controllers, and
     StarFive JH7110 pin and GPIO controllers.
<li> <b>Hardware monitoring</b>:
     MPS MPQ7932 regulators,
     HPE GXP fan controllers,
     NXP MC34VR500 power-management ICs, and
     Infineon TDA38640 voltage regulators.
<li> <b>Input</b>:
     EVision keyboards and
     Steam Deck force feedback controllers.
<li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>:
     Xilinx ZynqMP on-chip-memory controllers,
     MediaTek low-voltage thermal sensor controllers,
     Intel topology aware register/pm capsule interfaces,
     Aspeed ACRY RSA engines,
     StarFive JH7110 random number generators,
     Maxim MAX20411 single step-down converters, and
     Broadcom BCMBCA HS SPI controllers.
<li> <b>Networking</b>:
     Microchip KSZ9563/LAN937x Ethernet switch PTP clocks,
     Realtek RTL8188EU wireless interfaces,
     Ocelot VSC7511, VSC7512, VSC7513 and VSC7514 external switches,
     Amlogic GXL-based MDIO bus multiplexers,
     Motorcomm 8531 PHYs, and
     Qualcomm WiFi&nbsp;7 (ath12k) interfaces.
<li> <b>Sound</b>:
     MediaTek MT8188 controllers,
     Iron Device SMA1303 audio amplifiers,
     Renesas IDT821034 quad PCM codecs,
     Awinic AW88395 audio amplifiers,
     Realtek RT712 SDCA codecs, and
     Infineon PEB2466 quad PCM codecs.
<li> <b>Also</b>: preliminary support for writing <a
     href="/Articles/909109/">human-interface device drivers in BPF</a> has
     been merged, though the mechanism for distributing such drivers is
     still to be worked out.  See <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/hid/hid-bpf.html">this document</a>
     for more information.
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> Support for the Physical Layer Collision Avoidance (PLCA)
     Reconciliation Sublayer has been added; it is said to improve
     access performance on shared media Ethernet.  <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8580e16c28f3">This documentation
     patch</a> describes how to configure and use this feature.
<li> The "wireless extensions" API for the control of WiFi interfaces <a
     href="/Articles/202838/">ran into trouble</a> in 2006, but is still
     supported as an emulation layer.  This API will no longer be supported
     for WiFi&nbsp;7 (802.11be) interfaces, since it is unable to configure
     all of the available features.  The use of the wireless extensions API
     will generate a warning for most current devices as of 6.3.
<li> The process of documenting the netlink API continues; the results can
     be seen in the <a
     href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/core-api/netlink.html">core API</a>
     and <a
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/userspace-api/netlink/">user-space
     API</a> manuals.  Also added is <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/be5bea1cc0bf">a new tool</a> to
     generate netlink protocol code from YAML specifications.
<li> The new <tt>IP_LOCAL_PORT_RANGE</tt> socket option makes it easier for
     multiple hosts to make outgoing connections through a NAT gateway; <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/91d0b78c5177">this commit</a>
     contains details.
<li> Multi-path TCP can now handle mixed flows using both the IPv4 and IPv6
     protocols.
<li> <a href="/Articles/884104/">BIG TCP</a> support has been extended to
     IPv4.
<li> The new <tt>default_rps_mask</tt> sysctl knob allows the creation of a
     default, per-net-namespace <a
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html?highlight=rps#rps-receive-packet-steering">receive
     packet steering (RPS)</a> configuration.
<li> Support for a number of queuing disciplines (specifically class-based
     queuing (CBQ), ATM virtual circuits (ATM), differentiated service
     marker (dsmark), traffic-control index (tcindex), and resource
     reservation protocol (RSVP)) has been removed due to a lack of
     maintenance and interest.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Internal kernel changes</h4>
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">

<li> The old memory-allocation function <tt>get_kernel_pages()</tt> has
     been removed now that there are no more in-tree users.

</ul>
<p>
The 6.3 merge window can be expected to remain open until March 5, at which
point 6.3-rc1 will come out and the kernel will enter the stabilization
phase of the development cycle.  Quite a few more changes are poised to
enter the mainline before that happens, though; tune in once the merge
window closes for a summary of the rest of that work.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Could you elaborate re: "reinventing WASM" as it relates to this work?  The crux of that work was teaching the BPF verifier to understand natural-looking linked_list and rbtree usage. I'm not familiar with WASM so comparison isn't obvious to me.<br>

His point is (as I understand it) that instead of adding more and more fancy stuff to BPF until is is feature equivalent to WASM, which so far has been a *lot* of work if you look at the history of the kernel's BPF code, we could just â€¦ well â€¦ link a WASM compiler into the kernel.<br>
<p>
Reminds me of when I, in Linux's early days, was so fed up with the then-abysmal state of Linux networking that I linked the BSD network stack into it. It was not a particularly good fit, of course, but it worked.<br>

WASM runtimes allow limiting the runtime (or the number of instructions) for WASM programs. It has the same effect in practice as the BPF.<br>

And I'm pretty sure it's very easy to make BPF programs run for quite some time, if you combine list lookups and function calls. The raw instruction count has stopped being a good predictor for the maximum BPF runtime.<br>

If you just stop a program in the middle, you've got a problem, though; you could leave the kernel in a badly inconsistent state. If you wrote a WASM scheduler, and it got terminated due to timeout, what process would you schedule? What if it held a lock?<br>

The point isn't as much to avoid slowness as to have deterministic forward progress in the kernel.<br>

BPF doesn't guarantee this either. It has an early exit instruction (bpf_exit) that allows you to terminate the program earlier. It's entirely possible to take a lock and then do an early exit. Or to take two locks in the wrong order resulting in a deadlock, and the verifier will be happy. The only locking BPF allows is holding ONE spinlock at a time from a structure in a BPF map: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/779120/">https://lwn.net/Articles/779120/</a><br>
<p>
A similar lock helper can be created for WASM via a simple helper that will release the lock on timeout.<br>
<p>
With the scheduler example, BPF doesn't provide anything that can't be expressed in WASM. You can't express the invariant "BPF picks at least one process" in a way that the verifier understands.<br>

The verifier does complain if you try to exit while holding a spinlock. Also, it's totally possible to support holding more than one lock at a time. Deadlock avoidance is a challenge, but there are some cases (which have a substantial overlap with common usage scenarios) where you can easily prove or enforce it statically. I think it has not been done yet because no strong use case came up, rather than some kind of fundamental limitation in BPF.<br>

The last time I checked, the verifier supported only one lock at a time. <br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt;  Deadlock avoidance is a challenge</span><br>
<p>
I don't think it's even possible if BPF is allowed to use general-purpose locks that are used in other parts of the kernel. For the more restricted use-case, it's possible to force lock ordering. But this will require runtime tracking to be useful, you can't have static verification for anything non-trivial.<br>
<p>
The simplest way to do runtime tracking is to have a consistent numbering for locks, and when you take a lock, store the "lock tickets" in a linked list. This way you can verify that your previous lock has a greater number than the current one. It still will be somewhat limited (so no hand-over-hand locking), but it'll do for a large number of practical applications.<br>
<p>
But this of course can be expressed as a simple API exposed to WASM code, just as with the BPF use case.<br>

      <a href="https://blog.teledynelecroy.com/2022/08/physical-layer-collision-avoidance-in.html">This blog post</a> says the use case is "automotive Ethernet," where apparently you don't want to run a whole new Ethernet cable to a new switch port to add some new device inside a car, you just want to attach the device to the cable. Seems like this is the core feature of "10BASE-T1S."

      <p>It's basically a way to let you reuse a CANbus topology for Ethernet, so that you can entirely replace CANbus with Ethernet in your vehicle without paying a weight penalty.

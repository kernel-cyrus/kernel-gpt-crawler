<h1>Five-level page tables</h1>

<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 15, 2017</br>
           </div>
Near the beginning of 2005, the merging of the <a
href="/Articles/117749/">four-level page tables patches</a> for 2.6.10 was
an early test of the (then) new kernel development model.  It demonstrated that
the community could indeed merge fundamental changes and get them out
quickly to users — a far cry from the multi-year release cycles that
prevailed before the 2.6.0 release.  The merging of five-level page tables
(outside of the merge window) for 4.11-rc2, instead, barely raised an
eyebrow.  It is, however, a significant change  that is indicative of where
the computing industry is going.
<p>
A page table, of course, maps a virtual memory address to the physical
address where the data is actually stored.  It is conceptually a linear
array indexed by the virtual address (or, at least, by the page-frame-number
portion of that address) and yielding the page-frame number of the
associated physical page.  Such an array would be large, though,
and it would be hugely wasteful.  Most processes don't use the full
available virtual address space even on 32-bit systems, and they don't use
even a tiny fraction of it on 64-bit systems, so the address space tends to
be sparsely populated and, as a result, much of that array would
go unused.
<p>
The solution to this problem, as implemented in the hardware for decades,
is to turn the linear array into a sparse tree representing the address
space.  The result is something that looks like this:
<p>

<p>
The row of boxes across the top represents the bits of a 64-bit virtual
address.  To translate that address, the hardware splits the address into
several bit fields.  Note that, in the scheme shown here (corresponding to
how the x86-64 architecture uses addresses), the uppermost
16&nbsp;bits are discarded; only the lower 48&nbsp;bits of the virtual
address are 
used.  Of the bits that are used, the nine most significant (bits 39-47)
are used to index into the page global directory (PGD); a single page for
each address space.  The value read there is the address of the page upper
directory (PUD); bits 30-38 of the virtual address are used to index into
the indicated PUD page to get the address of the page middle directory
(PMD).  With bits 21-29, the PMD can be indexed to get the lowest level
page table, just called the PTE.  Finally, bits 12-20 of the virtual
address will, when used to index into the PTE, yield the physical address
of the actual page containing the data.  The lowest twelve bits of the
virtual address are the
offset into the page itself.
<p>
At any level of the page table, the pointer to the next level can be null,
indicating that there are no valid virtual addresses in that range.  This
scheme thus allows large subtrees to be missing, corresponding to ranges of
the address space that have no mapping.  The middle levels can also have
special entries indicating that they point directly to a (large) physical
page rather than to a lower-level page table; that is how huge pages are
implemented.  A 2MB huge page would be found directly at the PMD level,
with no intervening PTE page, for example.
<p>
One can quickly see that the process of translating a virtual address is
going to be expensive, requiring several fetches from main memory.  That is
why the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is so important for the
performance of the system as a whole, and why huge pages, which require
fewer lookups, also help.
<p>
It is worth noting that not all systems run with four levels of page
tables.  32-Bit systems use three or even two levels, for example.  The
memory-management code is written as if all four levels were always
present; some careful coding ensures that, in kernels configured to use
fewer levels, the code managing the unused levels is transparently left
out. 
<p>
Back when four-level page tables were merged, your editor wrote: "<q>Now
x86-64 users can have a virtual address space covering 128TB of memory,
which really should last them for a little while.</q>"  The value of "a
little while" can now be quantified: it would appear to be about
12&nbsp;years.  Though, in truth, the real constraint appears to be the
64TB of physical memory that current x86-64 processors can address; as
Kirill Shutemov noted in <a href="/Articles/716916/">the x86 five-level
page-table patches</a>, there are already vendors shipping systems with
that much memory installed.
<p>
As is so often the case in this field, the solution is to add another level
of indirection in the form of a fifth level of page tables.  The new level,
called the "P4D", is inserted between the PGD and the PUD.  The patches
adding this level were merged for 4.11-rc2, even though there is, at this
point, no support for five-level paging on any hardware.   While the
addition of four-level page tables caused a bit of nervousness, the
five-level patches merged were described as "low risk".  At this point, the
memory-management developers have a pretty good handle on the changes that
need to be made to add another level.
<p>

The patches adding five-level support for upcoming Intel processors is
currently slated for 4.12.  Systems running with five-level paging will
support 52-bit physical addresses and 57-bit virtual addresses.  Or, as
Shutemov put it: "<q>It bumps the limits to 128 PiB of virtual address
space and 4 PiB of physical address space. This 'ought to be enough for
anybody'.</q>"  The new level also allows the creation of 512GB huge
pages.
<p>
The current patches have a couple of loose ends to take care of.  One of
those is that Xen will not work on systems with five-level page tables
enabled; it will continue to work on four-level systems.  There is also a
need for a boot-time flag to allow switching between four-level and
five-level paging so that distributors don't have to ship two different
kernel binaries.
<p>
Another interesting problem is <a href="/Articles/717300/">described</a> at
the end of the patch series.  It would appear that there are programs out
there that "know" that only the bottom 48 bits of a virtual address are
valid.  They take advantage of that knowledge by encoding other information
in the uppermost bits.  Those programs will clearly break if those bits
suddenly become part of the address itself.  To avoid such problems, the
x86 patches in their current form will not allocate memory in the new
address space by default.  An application that needs that much memory, and
which does not play games with virtual addresses, can provide an address
hint above the boundary in a call to <tt>mmap()</tt>, at which point the
kernel will understand that mappings in the upper range are accessible.
<p>
Anybody wanting to play with the new mode can do so now with QEMU, which
understands five-level page tables.  Otherwise it will be a matter of
waiting for the processors to come out — and the funds to buy a machine
with that much memory in it.  When the hardware is available, the kernel
should be ready for it.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
No, x86 5-level paging doesn't add new huge page size.<br>
<p>
And it's not very related to 5-level paging in general: we could have 512GB pages with 4-level paging too -- on pgd level.<br>

      <p>Only Java programmers could ever invent something that crazy. To handle four levels using cycle is just extremely wasteful, especially if they all are slightly different (middle level could be used for huge pages, lowest level specifies not another tables but pages itself, etc).</p>

No, not only Java programmers like me, sadly. I've seen much stupider things in a variety of language s, from C to Java to Ruby to Javascript to Python to Prolog. And even coded a few stupid things myself in each language. <br>
<p>
I think the most inefficient thing I've ever coded was actually in Prolog. <br>
<p>
And read the article  - it's the damn C programmers that thought they /we were so clever in shoving stuff in the upper bits of pointers that mean the rest of us have to jump through hoops to get access to more memory. And shoving stuff into pointers *is* the kind of stupidity that seems highly correlated to the language of choice. <br>

      Yes, making maximum use of the bits in a pointer is something you only do in a low-level language such as C.  This technique has certain benefits (efficiency) and certain drawbacks (as evidenced here).  Since you are smarter than these programmers, you can demonstrate how to achieve equivalent time and memory efficiency in a Javascript implementation without "shoving stuff into pointers".

Lisps have been doing that since times immemorial ("tagged pointers"). But they learnt the lesson and most of them switched to using the lower bits: if you know the structures you point to are aligned, you get two to three bits "down there". Of course you don't have the luxury of full 16 bit, but hey.<br>

Easy. Since your "trade-off" is to risk violating and corrupting memory to achieve this, by making invalid assumptions about how the memory subsystem works, simply save yourself the overhead of malloc, and blindly read and write to memory with allocating it ahead of time :P.<br>

But if you do want to know how smart people (not me) intelligently hand stuff like this, look to Java programmers, as in the people who program Java, as in program the JVM:<br>

that math and the picture don't seem to add up: 18+48=66 != 64 :)<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; With bits 21-29, the PUD can be indexed to get the lowest level page table, just called the PTE.</font><br>
<p>
the PUD is indexed by only one set of bits, this latter wants to be the PMD i guess.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt;  The patches adding five-level support for upcoming Intel processors is currently slated for 4.12. Systems running with five-level paging will support 52-bit physical addresses and 57-bit virtual addresses. Or, as Shutemov put it: "It bumps the limits to 128 PiB of virtual address space and 4 PiB of physical address space. This 'ought to be enough for anybody'." The new level also allows the creation of 512GB huge pages.</font><br>
<p>
Finally. Currently, SPARC is the only architecture with 52 VA bits and many Javascript implementations are therefore broken on SPARC for this reason. If x86_64 uses more VA bits as well, it means there is finally some pressure on the Javascript engine developers to address this issue.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; An application that needs that much memory, and which does not play games with virtual addresses, can provide an address hint above the boundary in a call to mmap(), at which point the kernel will understand that mappings in the upper range are accessible.</font><br>
<p>
The problem here is that this hint is honored for mmap() only provided that the memory area pointed to by "hint" is still free. If it is already allocated, mmap() will again return an address from the top of the VA space and hence exceed the 48-bit limit [1]. On NetBSD, for example, mmap() will allocate memory in the vicinity of "hint" instead of ignoring it completely. Because of this, Firefox has an ugly workaround for this issue on Linux/arm64 which employs a manual allocator for the Javascript heap [2].<br>
<p>
So, if they are suggesting people to use "hint" for mmap() to avoid the problems with applications that assume 48-bit addresses spaces, they will need to restore the original behavior of mmap() which is described in [1].<br>

<a href="/Articles/KernelSummit2012/">2012 Kernel Summit</a>

</div>
<p> John Stultz kicked off a session of the 2012 Kernel Summit <a
href="/Articles/516439/">memcg/mm minisummit</a> by saying that his work on <a
href="/Articles/500382/">volatile ranges</a> was motivated by Android's
<tt>ashmem</tt>, and he thanked Robert Love specifically. He then proceeded
to explain the basic idea of volatile ranges, which is to provide a means
whereby a process can inform the kernel that it can discard specific pages
if memory pressure is high; if the pages are discarded, then it is assumed
that the process has sufficient information that it can re-create the data.
He covered the history of the different approaches that he tried in the
past and what problems he had with each of them.

<p> The current approach he is considering is to use an LRU (least recently used) list of "easily
reclaimable" pages that at a minimum would contain all the pages that have
been marked volatile.  This new LRU list would always be shrunk first when
there is memory pressure and pages must be reclaimed.  Andrea Arcangeli
argued that this should be unnecessary and that the pages should instead
just be moved to the tail of the anonymous page LRUs in order to be
reclaimed first; but others pointed out that if there is no swap, then the
inactive list for anonymous pages does not rotate.  Rik van Riel felt that
the "volatile ranges" pages should not necessarily always be reclaimed
first and the decision about whether to reclaim from them should come down
to the cost of re-creating the data.  However, the kernel can't know that
cost, so the point could be argued either way.

<p> The discussion moved on to the cost of moving pages between LRUs and
detecting when the data needs to be re-created.  Having declared a range of
pages as volatile, an application can later declare them non-volatile (if
it decides it needs to access them again); for the latter operation, the
application needs to use the system-call return value to detect when the
data needs to be recovered.  Continually marking pages volatile and
non-volatile like this would be very expensive, but not enough people were
familiar enough with John's patch set to give concrete proposals on how the
implementation could be improved.  A few ideas were bounced around, but
John appealed to memory-management developers to look more closely at his
patches and give advice on how the implementation should be finished,
because he feels he is insufficiently experienced with memory management to
make all the decisions.

<p> The discussion also covered a few other points.  John was asked what
the semantics are if a process accesses a page that has been marked as
volatile.  Currently, he said, you get either data (if the page has not
been discarded) or zeros (if it has).  Maybe, he said, we should deliver a
<tt>SIGSEGV</tt> signal; Hugh Dickins suggested that <tt>SIGBUS</tt> would
be better.  The current user-space interface is <tt>fallocate()</tt>, and
the question was raised as to whether this was the right API. Hugh Dickins
felt that <tt>fadvise()</tt> or <tt>madvise()</tt> would be more
appropriate. (However, things are going a little bit in circles here, since
an earlier version of John's patches used <tt>fadvise()</tt>, but Dave
Chinner <a href="/Articles/516434/">suggested</a> that <tt>fallocate()</tt>
would be better suited.)

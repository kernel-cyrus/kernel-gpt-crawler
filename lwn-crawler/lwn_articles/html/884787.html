           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>February 17, 2022</br>
           </div>
Linus Torvalds <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CA+55aFx93de2f2bRbCp74uNX0LxkgpSKE8uOGFrk63xe_9YDwg@mail.gmail.com/">released
the 4.4 kernel</a> on January 10, 2016 and promptly left the building for
the greener fields of 4.5.  This kernel was finished from his point of
view, but it was just beginning its life in the wider world, and became the
first long-term-stable release to be supported for more than two years.
Indeed, the 4.4 release became one of the longest-supported and most widely
used releases in the history of the kernel project (so far); it was
deployed in vast numbers of Android devices, among other places.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1643877137240249@kroah.com/">final 4.4 stable
release</a> took place on February&nbsp;3, over six years after 4.4 was
"finished"; it is time to take a look at what happened to 4.4 in its
stable life.
<p>
There were 302 stable updates released for 4.4 over the 2,216 days of its
supported life — approximately one release per week for the entire six
years.  Those releases added 18,974 non-merge changesets to that "stable"
kernel (about 8.6 patches per day, every day).  By virtue of that work, the
4.4 kernel grew by nearly 90,000 lines of code; 72&nbsp;new source files
were added during that time.
<p>
<h4>Contributing developers</h4>
<p>
The 4.4 stable series thus looks, in some ways, like another development
cycle, but with even more patches.  Some of the other numbers are larger as
well; the fixes added to 4.4 were contributed by 3,528 developers over
those six years, representing just under 500 different employers.  Kernel
developers may like adding new features but, in the end, almost all of them
end up fixing bugs as well.  The top bug fixers were:

<p>
Note that most of Greg Kroah-Hartman's "fixes" are actually the 302 tags
applied to mark each release, leaving 117 actual fixes.  The developers involved say a lot about
where the bugs show up; Eric Dumazet works in networking and Takashi Iwai is
the sound maintainer, for example.  Arnd Bergmann, instead, puts a lot of
effort into fixing problems all over the kernel tree, as does Dan
Carpenter.  Johan Hovald works all over the driver tree with a focus on the
USB subsystem.  It is worth noting that even the most productive
contributors of fixes were individually responsible for less than 2% of the
total.
<p>
A bit of a different story comes out if one looks at testers and reviewers.

Only 1,527 patches applied to 4.4 contained Tested-by tags — that is just
8% of the total.  That seems a bit surprising, given that each of those
patches is meant to be a fix, so testing whether it works should be
relatively straightforward.
<p>
The first few lines of the Reviewed-by column
are not particularly surprising; both Kroah-Hartman and Christoph Hellwig
do a lot of reviews in general, and David Sterba is the Btrfs maintainer.
The next few names, Alexey Makhalov, Matt Helsley, and Bo Gan, are a bit
more surprising, though; Makhalov and Helsley only have one directly
authored patch 
each in the kernel, while Gan has none.  In all three cases, digging through the
logs shows a flurry of activity in mid-2018; these three developers, as it
turns out, played a big role in the backporting of the Meltdown and Spectre
fixes to the 4.4 kernel.
<p>
<h4>Patch review and selection</h4>
<p>
There were 4,101 patches applied to 4.4 that contained at least one
Reviewed-by tag; that is 22% of the total.  Compare that to the 37% of
patches going into 5.16 with such tags.  One might conclude that patches
going into the stable kernels are getting less review than they should, but
it is also likely that we are seeing the growth in the use of Reviewed-by
tags over time.  The fact that only 19% of the patches going into 4.5 had
Reviewed-by tags would tend to back up that hypothesis.
<p>
How are the bugs fixed in the stable updates found?  One clue can be found
in the <tt>Reported-by</tt> tags used to credit bug reporters; 3,529
commits in 4.4.x contained such tags, with the most active reporters being:

<p>
Dmitry Vyukov is the developer behind Syzbot, so the first two lines could
properly be combined, showing that one developer is responsible for nearly
21% of the credited bug reports leading to 4.4.x fixes — an impressive
total.  Other automated testing systems added another 6.6% of the reports.
Some of the other top reporters are almost certainly using tools of their
own to seek out bugs.  Every one of these bugs is a problem that was fixed
before it was encountered by users, which can only be a good thing.
<p>

Also on the topic of tags: maintainers add <tt>stable@vger.kernel.org</tt>
to a patch's CC list to mark a patch as being suitable for stable-kernel
updates.  Over the course of 4.4.x, 3446 patches (a bit over 18% of the
total) were marked in this way.  Obviously, the CC list is not the
mechanism by which most patches get into the stable updates.  In some
subsystems <strike>(networking in particular)</strike>, the maintainers
manage a separate 
queue of stable-bound patches and actively discourage developers from
marking patches themselves.
<p>
Most of the time, though, the patches are
being picked by the stable-kernel maintainers themselves, either by hand or
through the use of a machine-learning system.
This process is <a href="/Articles/863505/">frequently controversial</a>.
The <tt>Fixes:</tt> tag is often thought to be the indicator used by the
stable team to pick patches that have not been explicitly marked for stable
updates.  The 4.4.x series included 7,629 patches with such tags, which is
still only 40% of the total, so that tag is not a strong indicator either.
The stable team is selecting patches that look like fixes even in the lack
of any explicit markings.
<p>
<h4>Regressions and overall conclusion</h4>
<p>
One interesting use for <tt>Fixes:</tt> tags, though, is to see whether
they refer to other patches that had been included in previous stable
releases.  In other words, is a patch with a <tt>Fixes:</tt> tag fixing a
bug that was introduced in the stable series itself?  Each such occurrence
would indicate a regression shipped in a stable update, which
is exactly what the stable kernels are meant to avoid.
<p>
Over the course of the 4.4 stable series, <a href="/Articles/884852/">1,309
patches</a> contained 
<tt>Fixes:</tt> tags referring to commits appearing earlier in the stable
series.  Of those, though, 310 fixed patches that had been merged for the
<i>same</i> 
stable update; those bugs never made it through to a release, and thus
should not be counted as regressions.  Some patches required multiple fixes
and should not be counted twice; filtering those out leaves 884 patches — 4.7% of the
total — that added regressions to the stable updates.  Many of these
regressions were likely never noticed by users, of course, but a few of
them were serious.
<p>
Through all of this, the 4.4 kernels drove a huge number of devices.  It
was an allowed kernel version for the Android&nbsp;7 through&nbsp;9 releases, and is,
without doubt, still running on a lot of devices despite the end of ongoing
support.  Many millions of people have benefited from the work that the
stable-kernel maintainers (and all of the people who have helped them) have
done.  Assigning a dollar value to this work would be difficult, but the
resulting number would have to be huge; it is a significant gift to the
world as a whole.
<p>
The free-software community has often shown that it is better at
cranking out software than supporting that software over long periods of
time; the latter task often falls to providers who expect to be paid for
access to their work.  The 4.4.x kernel has
shown, though, that the kernel community is, when it sets its mind to the
task, indeed able to provide support 
for a full six years.  The stable team's approach to picking patches is
controversial, and probably will always be regardless of how the policy
evolves, but the results were clearly good enough to build an extended
ecosystem around.  It is hard to conclude that this effort was anything but a
significant success.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is not correct; 2.6.32, 3.2, 3.10, and 3.16 were also supported for 4-6 years. This was the first stable branch that Greg maintained for this long though.<br>

At least I think Ben and I will both agree that Greg&#x27;s 4.4 has been of higher quality for users than the kernels we used to maintain ourselves. First it was released way more often, which eases reviewing and bisecting. Second, by being &quot;official&quot; (ours used to appear as &quot;extended LTS&quot;) it was likely much more regarded by the entire community as a kernel to care about in backports. While Ben and I were often on our own when trying to backport some fixes to these older kernels, I observed more efforts generally speaking on 4.4 and the subsequent ones, which is great because it indicates that long-term stability is becoming something imporrtant for many developers. For me the current cycle is perfect, and the proof is that I no longer have to maintain one myself ;-) Big thanks to Greg for this!<br>

Yes, I agree with all of that. I&#x27;m much happier being a contributor to the newer LTS branches than being a maintainer.<br>

As a user of 4.4 at home until it went EOL, I think the concept of these long use kernels are nice, plus I never had issues with it.<br>
<p>
Now on 5.15 at home, I hope it has the same stability as 4.4 had.<br>

What&#x27;s awesome with reasonably long lifes like this is that you can adopt them early on non-critical machines and progressively deploy them on more sensitive machines as time passes and your trust grows. For example at work we&#x27;re using them in our appliances which require an extreme reliability. LTS kernels are really excellent after 6mo-1yr. In the past it was too late to adopt them for end-user products. Now I can use them on my laptop for 1yr, then we use them in our products for 3 years, and there are still 2 years left to cover different migration start times, possibly extended lives in field, etc. That&#x27;s the Linux kernel I had been dreaming of since 2.4 when I created the hotfix branch ;-)<br>

FWIW that&#x27;s no longer true. The special rules were dropped last March - commit dbbe7c962c3a (&quot;docs: networking: drop special stable handling&quot;)<br>

      Interesting, I had completely missed that.  That's what happens, I guess, when documentation patches by pass the docs maintainer :)  Apologies for the confusion.

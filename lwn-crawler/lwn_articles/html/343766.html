<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>July 28, 2009</br>
           </div>
The <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/322666/">ftrace</a> tracing
infrastructure has only been in the mainline since 2.6.27 - less than one
year.  During that time, ftrace has seen a great deal of development and
has acquired several new capabilities.  It now provides many of the
features that come with more heavyweight tools like SystemTap, along with
some which are unique to ftrace.  But there are still capabilities found in
"real" tracing utilities which are not present in ftrace.  One of the more
significant limitations is the lack of dynamic tracing; ftrace can easily
trace function calls or use static tracepoints placed in the kernel source,
but it cannot add its own tracepoints on the fly.  That could change,
though, should Masami Hiramatsu's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/343345/">kprobe-based event tracer patch</a>
make it into the mainline.
<p>

The kprobes mechanism has been a part of the kernel for a long time; LWN
ran <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/132196/">an overview of it</a> back in
2005.  Kprobes are, of course, dynamic tracepoints; by use of on-the-fly
code patching, the kernel can hook into its own code at any point.  Tools
like SystemTap use kprobes to implement their dynamic tracing features.
With SystemTap, though, these probes are inserted by way of a special
kernel module generated on the fly - a bit of a tricky interface.  Masami's
patch aims to turn the insertion of dynamic probes into something close to
a command-line operation.
<p>
The patch creates a new debugfs file
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_events</tt>.  A new probe is inserted
by appending a line to that file; that line has a somewhat complex format:
<p>
<pre>
    p[:EVENT] SYMBOL[+offset|-offset]|MEMADDR [FETCHARGS]
    r[:EVENT] SYMBOL[+0] [FETCHARGS]
</pre>
<p>
The first variant will set a probe with the optional name <tt>EVENT</tt>
(if the name isn't supplied, the code makes one up).  The probe will be
placed at the location of the given <tt>SYMBOL</tt>, adjusted by the
optional <tt>offset</tt>; an absolute address (<tt>MEMADDR</tt>) can also
be used to locate the probe.  The <tt>FETCHARGS</tt> portion of the line
describes the data to be fetched and emitted when the tracepoint is hit;
the syntax allows the specification of various types of data, including
register contents, stack offsets, absolute addresses, kernel symbols,
function arguments, and more.  What the code does not currently allow is
much in the way of sophisticated formatting of this data; it comes out in
straight hexadecimal format.
<p>
The second line, above, inserts a "retprobe" instead.  Retprobes are fired
when the given function (as specified by <tt>SYMBOL</tt>) returns to its
caller; they can capture the function's return value and the address it is
returning to.
<p>
The patch posting contains an example of a couple of probes placed in
<tt>do_sys_open()</tt>; the commands to do so are:
<p>
<pre>
    echo p:myprobe do_sys_open a0 a1 a2 a3 &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_events
    echo r:myretprobe do_sys_open rv ra &gt;&gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_events
</pre>
<p>
Two probes are placed here.  One called <tt>myprobe</tt> will fire on entry
to <tt>do_sys_open()</tt> and output the values of the four arguments
passed to that function.  The other, <tt>myretprobe</tt>, triggers when
<tt>do_sys_open()</tt> returns, fetching the return value and return
address in the process.
<p>
The output from these tracepoints can be seen by reading
<tt>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
#           TASK-PID    CPU#    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
#              | |       |          |         |
           &lt;...&gt;-1447  [001] 1038282.286885: do_sys_open+0x0/0xd6: 0xffffff9c 0x40413c 0x8000 0x1b6
           &lt;...&gt;-1447  [001] 1038282.286915: sys_open+0x1b/0x1d &lt;- do_sys_open: 0x3 0xffffffff81367a3a
</pre>
<p>
Here we see a call to <tt>do_sys_open()</tt> with its four parameters:
the directory file descriptor (<tt>0xffffff9c</tt>), file name pointer
(<tt>0x40413c</tt>), flags (<tt>0x8000</tt>), and mode (<tt>0x1b6</tt>).
For the curious, the strange file descriptor value is the magic value
<tt>AT_FDCWD</tt>, meaning that the file lookup should begin in the current
working directory.  There is also a return line (as indicated by the
"<tt>&lt;-</tt>" arrow) showing that the call returned to
<tt>sys_open()</tt>, having opened file descriptor&nbsp;3.
<p>
The patch also provides mechanisms for turning individual probes on and
off, filtering probe output, and maintaining profiles of probe hits.
<p>
Tracing of function entry and exit as shown above is a useful feature, but
the existing ftrace function tracer can do that already.  The obvious value
in this new patch is the ability to place tracepoints at locations other
than function entry and exit points.  But that leads to an interesting
question: how does the user manage to get tracepoints set in the right
locations?  Guessing at offsets from function symbols seems like a recipe
for trouble, especially given that the placement of a tracepoint in the
middle of an instruction is unlikely to lead to pleasant results.
<p>
Addressing that last concern is, as it turns out, the job of the bulk of
the code in Masami's patch.  Placing probes is relatively easy - the code
to do that is already in the kernel.  But making sure that the probe is in
the right place requires the addition of an x86 instruction decoding
module.  When a probe is requested within a function, the instruction
decoder goes to work; it starts at the beginning of the function and
decodes instructions until it reaches the probe point.  If the probe is
located at an instruction boundary, all is well; otherwise the placement of
the probe is disallowed.
<p>
Actually generating the right offsets for dynamic probes is likely to be a
job for user-space software which can parse debugging information and map
line numbers onto offsets.  A tool like a debugger or SystemTap, for
example.  It is, in fact, conceivable that tools like SystemTap could move
over to this mechanism once it's merged; that would allow SystemTap to
share more of the low-level ftrace plumbing and get it closer to working
with unpatched mainline kernels.
<p>
That's getting a little ahead of the game, though; first the kprobe-based
event tracing code needs to be merged.  There does not appear to be any
real opposition to that merger - but this code has been around for a while
and is currently on its 13th revision.  The value of getting real dynamic
probing support into the kernel seems reasonably evident, though; expect
this feature to get in at some point.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Yes, to some extent.

Yes, to some extent.
<p>

<p>
No.  This part of systemtap has worked fine with unpatched mainline kernels since the beginning.

      Sorry to self-reply, but:
<p>
<i>... and get it closer to working with unpatched mainline kernels</i>
<p>
Makes it sound as if this was some sort of future aspiration.  That's wrong: <b>systemtap has essentially always worked with unpatched mainline kernels</b>.  (An issue that confuses some is that the user-space probing extensions require utrace.  If you don't use that extension in your script, it does not matter.)

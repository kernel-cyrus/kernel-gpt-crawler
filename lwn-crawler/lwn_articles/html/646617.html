<p>
Modern Linux systems have a directory tree at <tt>/sys/devices</tt>
that contains information about all of the &quot;devices&quot; represented in
the device model.  Having <a
href="/Articles/645810/">clarified</a> exactly what each of
"devices", "buses", and "classes" are (or maybe what they aren't), I am now
in a position to address a shortcoming I had to admit in a <a
href="/Articles/604413/">recent article</a> where I stated
that <tt>/sys/devices</tt> "<q>has a structure that, in all honesty,
is rather hard to describe</q>".</p>

<p>
<tt>/sys/devices</tt> is part of the <tt>sysfs</tt> virtual filesystem; it
presents 
devices as directories arranged in a hierarchy.  It includes various
files to allow details of each device to be examined and sometimes to
be changed.  Seeing how they all plug together can give insights into
the device model that are not evident by just examining individual
devices.

To describe this directory structure in detail there are three
particular concepts we need to examine beyond the device, bus, and
class that we met last time.  We need to explore parentage,
attributes, and namespace management.</p>

<h4>Parenthood</h4>

<p>
Each device (or &quot;thing&quot;) in the Linux device model can have a &quot;parent&quot;
device.  In the examples from last week, the &quot;tca6507&quot; device was the
parent of some &quot;<tt>leds</tt>&quot; devices, and itself had a parent that was an
i2c adapter device, such as &quot;i2c-1&quot;.  The parent of the device
representing a partition on a hard drive is the device representing
the hard drive as a whole.  &quot;Workqueue&quot; devices do not have parents.

This variety leads to the question of what, exactly, is a &quot;parent&quot;.
There are several different, though related, concepts that are tied up
in this idea of &quot;parenthood&quot;.</p>
<h4>Parent as connection point or service provider</h4>

<p>
Firstly there is the idea of &quot;addressability&quot; and the related idea of
&quot;connectedness&quot;.  When a device represents a piece of hardware, the
parent often represents a connection to that device.  This parent knows how to
interpret the &quot;address&quot; of the device, and how to send instructions to
that address, or how to transfer data to or from that address.  The
parent doesn't know much about what those instructions or data
might do; that knowledge is in the device itself (and its driver).</p>

<p>
Closely related to connection is the idea of service provision.  When a device
represents a piece of hardware, the primary service it needs from a parent
device is
communication with the CPU.  When a device represents something else,
the primary service requirement might be different.</p>

<p>
Many devices that are implemented by classes do not exactly represent
hardware but instead represent an abstraction.  Devices in the &quot;disk&quot;
class represent anything that can provide read or write access to
addressable blocks of storage.  Any device that can facilitate that access might
reasonably find itself as the parent of a &quot;disk&quot; device.  Sometimes
the thing that provides service is not a device â€” it might be a file
or a network connections or a set of devices.  In those cases the
disk device won't have a parent.</p>

<p>
I like to picture these two complementary ideas (connection and service
provision) by imagining the path 
a request takes from user space all the way to ultimate physical reality.


A request such as &quot;turn the LED on&quot; or &quot;read that block of data&quot;,
enters the device hierarchy at one of the leaf devices, possibly by a
<tt>write()</tt> or <tt>ioctl()</tt> on a device node in <tt>/dev</tt> or
by a write to a sysfs 
attribute file.  The request then propagates up the tree, being
translated at each stage as is appropriate to each level.  Some levels
might add extra detail to the address, some levels might wrap
&quot;protocol headers&quot; around the message, or divide the message up into
components.  Another level might add a retry mechanism or might impose
a media-access protocol.</p>

<p>
Once the message gets to the top of the hierarchy it is transmitted
on a core system bus (probably via writing to one or more memory
addresses), at which point the request travels through the hardware
from controller to controller in a rough analog of traveling back down
the tree of devices and out to the physical leaves that are the hardware
that will actually pass current through an LED, or read the data off
some sort of media.</p>

<p>
To make this more concrete, consider an <tt>leds</tt> device with the
&quot;<tt>default-on</tt>&quot; trigger selected, and then consider writing
&quot;<tt>100</tt>&quot; to the &quot;<tt>brightness</tt>&quot; file, which
implies a request to set the brightness to <tt>100/255</tt> of the maximum
brightness (assuming that <tt>max_brightness</tt> is <tt>255</tt>).  The
full path to that file might be:</p>

<pre>
    /sys/devices/platform/omap_i2c.2/i2c-2/2-0045/leds/gta04:green:power/brightness  
</pre>
<p>

The trigger driver leaves that request for the <tt>leds</tt> core to handle; the
core determines whether one of two possible interfaces
(<tt>brightness_set()</tt> or <tt>brightness_set_sync()</tt>) is available
and calls it if so; otherwise it returns an error.  When an <tt>leds</tt> device is
registered by a call to <tt>led_classdev_register()</tt>, a <tt>struct
led_classdev</tt> must be passed; it contains various function
pointers and other settings that provide access to the underlying
mechanism.  So the <tt>leds</tt> driver turns the &quot;set
brightness&quot; request into one of two possible function calls into the
parent device.</p>

<p>
If that parent device is the TCA6507 we discussed previously (named
&quot;2-0045&quot; above) then <tt>tca6507_brightness_set()</tt> is called.  The
TCA6507 does not provide completely independent control of the seven
output pins.  Apart from fully on and fully off, there are at most three
distinct brightness levels from a set of 16 possible levels.  If the
request level matches a level already configured, that can be assigned
to the appropriate pin.  If not, and there are fewer than three in use,
then the new level can be programmed to a free slot.  If all
brightness slots are in use, the closest to the requested value is
used.</p>

<p>
In any case, the decisions need to be sent to the TCA6507 which, like
most simple I2C devices,  appears to contain a set of
registers.  So the <tt>leds-tca6507</tt> driver converts the
<tt>brightness_set()</tt> 
request into one or more &quot;write to register&quot; requests.  Those
requests must, in turn, be passed to the device via an I2C bus.
</p>

<p>
When an I2C driver is attached to a device, its <tt>probe()</tt> function
is called with a <tt>struct i2c_client</tt> parameter.  When the driver
wants to write to a register it calls <tt>i2c_smbus_write_byte_data()</tt>
or a similar function, giving it the same <tt>i2c_client</tt> handle, the
register address, and the data.  &quot;<tt>smbus</tt>&quot; refers to &quot;System
Management Bus&quot; which is a subset of the I2C protocol â€” drivers that
only need that subset are encouraged to use the <tt>smbus</tt>
interfaces.</p>

<p>

The i2c/smbus code (implementing device &quot;i2c-2&quot;) takes the
&quot;register write&quot; request and converts that into a message to
transmitted on the i2c bus; it contains a command, an address, and data.
The underlying I2C adapter driver can provide a couple of different
functions, such as <tt>smbus_xfer()</tt> or <tt>master_xfer()</tt>, the
latter being a lower-level function that needs more support in the
I2C bus code.  These functions may be called repeatedly to
effect retry on certain failure modes, and are only called after
<tt>i2c_lock_adapter()</tt> has successfully gained exclusive access to the
bus.</p>

<p>
So now those &quot;write to register&quot; requests have become &quot;message transfer&quot;
calls with locking and retry.</p>

<p>
If that underlying I2C adapter is the OMAP I2C adapter (&quot;omap_i2c.2&quot;),
it will ensure the clocks for the adapter are enabled, make sure
it isn't being held in reset, and wait to make sure the bus isn't being
used by some other bus master.  The driver will then load the size and address
of each message into the DMA engine of the adapter so that it can copy
the messages out onto the bus.  This is all done by writing directly
to registers in the I2C adapter using the system memory bus.</p>

<p>
At this point the message hasn't quite reached the top of the
<tt>/sys/devices</tt> hierarchy; that step brings in the "platform" device,
which represents the
whole platform and the main system memory bus, used by the I2C driver
to talk to the I2C adapter.  The memory bus driver doesn't get
involved in copying bytes out, but it was involved when the devices
were registered in that it effectively told the I2C driver what
address to use to talk to its hardware.</p>

<p>
The memory bus carries these writes to the I2C adapter, which fetches
the messages from memory and serializes them out onto the I2C bus.
The TCA6507 collects the bits off the bus, places them in the
addressed register, and then loads internal counters as appropriate so
that it can turn the particular pin on and off with the right duty
cycle to achieve the requested brightness (or something close to it).
This pulls current through the LED so that it generates light some of
the time, and doesn't for the rest of the time.  Our eyes, which
naturally integrate those high frequency changes, see something close
to the requested brightness level.  It seems like a long journey, but
it gets from:
<p>
<pre>
    echo 100 &gt; brightness
</pre>
<p>
all the way to my eyes faster
than I can blink.</p>

<p>
While this is a helpful picture, it is a somewhat idealized picture.
It is important to be aware that the &quot;primary&quot; service provider is not
necessarily the only service provider.  A specific LED can be
configured to blink whenever some specific battery other than the primary
is charging, for example. 
So both the LED and the charge monitoring hardware provide services to
the &quot;power supply&quot; device.</p>

<p>
In most cases where there are multiple services being provided, there
will be one that is fairly obviously primary.  Other times there is
not.  A RAID array receives service of equal value from a number of
different block devices.  And it could stop receiving that service
at any moment if one fails.  So there is no clear primary service
provider for a RAID array, and indeed md/raid devices do not have a
parent.</p>
<h4>Parent as discoverer</h4>

<p>
The third idea is again related to the others but provides a helpful
alternate perspective.  It is &quot;discovery&quot;.  Every device must be
deliberately added to the device model; this process is referred to
a &quot;device discovery&quot;.  When driver code, acting on behalf of a
particular device, discovers another device, it needs to assign a
parent to the new device; it will typically use the current device as that
parent.</p> 

<p>
Sometimes this discovery is performed by probing a (physical) bus to
see what devices are connected to it.  A similar situation
happens when a bus supports hotplug and the bus controller reports
that a new device has been attached. In these cases, the device that
detects the new device is almost certainly the device that can
address and send commands to the new device, so it is logical for it
to be the parent.</p>

<p>
Other times, this discovery happens by examining a configured
description of available devices.  This might be based on information
extracted via a BIOS service such as ACPI, it might be encoded
using a device tree, or it could be encoded directly in the kernel using
arrays of &quot;<tt>struct platform_device</tt>&quot; and calls to
<tt>platform_add_devices()</tt>, though that approach is deprecated.


When ACPI is used, it will provide a top-level device similar to
&quot;platform&quot;, which is parent to the devices that are discovered and
managed using ACPI, even though ACPI is not exactly a physical
connection.</p>
<h4>Parent as power source</h4>

<p>
Finally there is the idea of power management.  As power management
was apparently one of the driving forces that led to the creation of
the device model and <tt>/sys/devices</tt>, you might expect that power
management would be fairly central.  The reality is ... more complex.</p>

<p>
There are two sides to power management.  One is system suspend or
system hibernate, where the focus is putting as many devices as
possible to the lowest power state.  The other is runtime power
management, where the focus is placing individual devices into a low power state
whenever they aren't actively in use.  It might seem reasonable to
follow parent-child links in a depth-first order, turning off children
and then their parents.  But that isn't quite what is done.</p>

<p>
In the case of system suspend, there is actually a completely separate
structure that is used to determine the order for shutting down
devices.  As I <a href="/Articles/505683/">described in 2012</a>, the
power-management code maintains a  
linear list of devices called &quot;<tt>dpm_list</tt>&quot; that is used to
sequence 
suspend and resume.  This list is created roughly in order of device
discovery, which is roughly how the tree of devices grows out to the
leaves.  So processing <tt>dpm_list</tt> in order will normally visit parents
before children.  However power often isn't managed in exactly the
same way as device addressing, so the power management system needs a
little more control, which it gets by having its own list.</p>

<p>
Runtime power management does make some use of parent/child
relationships, but not always.  Possibly not even often.</p>

<p>
For connections that are designed to carry both power and
control, such as USB, it makes lots of sense for the bus controller to
remain powered on (and providing power) whenever an attached device is
powered on.  However it may well make sense for the bus controller to
enter a low-power state while the device continues to do useful work,
particularly if the device can trigger some sort of wakeup event.</p>

<p>
For buses that do not carry power, such as i2c, it makes no sense to
directly link the power state of the bus controller with the power
state of the attached device.  Typically an i2c controller will power
down (stopping its clock) whenever it doesn't have any commands to
send.  When a device driver needs to talk to its device it will wake
up the controller (its parent), send the message, and let the
controller go back to sleep, even while the device itself is fully
active (blinking those LEDs).</p>

<p>
In the runtime power management system the default behavior is that,
when a child device is powered on, its parent must be powered on as
well.  This default can be overridden by a call to
<tt>pm_suspend_ignore_children()</tt>.  Given that many buses do not
carry power, I was at first surprised at how few calls there are to
this function: in 4.1-rc1 there are only 14 calls that enable the
ignoring of children.</p>

<p>
Part of the reason for this small number is that the default as stated
misses an important detail.  It only applies to devices that actually
support different runtime power-management states.  If both a parent and child
support runtime power management, then the default will keep the parent
powered when 
the child is active.  If either does not support runtime power management, then no
connection is implied.  This means that when a device wakes up, that
wakeup will only propagate up the tree until it reaches a device
that sets &quot;ignore_children&quot; or a device that doesn't support runtime
power management at all.  Then the propagation will stop.</p>

<p>
There are actually quite a lot of devices that do not support runtime
power management.  Most devices implemented by classes do not.</p>
<pre>
    $ cat /sys/class/*/*/power/runtime_status | sort | uniq -c
    318 unsupported
</pre>

<p>
Many devices implemented by buses do not either:</p>
<pre>
    $ cat /sys/bus/*/devices/*/power/runtime_status | sort | uniq -c
     57 active
     11 suspended
    274 unsupported
</pre>

<p>
So while runtime power management can make use of the parent link, it
doesn't to a great extent.  The parent very often is <em>not</em> the source
of power, only of addressing and control.</p>

<p>
Despite the apparent richness of meaning we find in parenthood, the
device model doesn't really use it much.  As a message passes &quot;up&quot; the
hierarchy, it doesn't follow the &quot;<tt>-&gt;parent</tt>&quot; links of the device
model, but uses references that were provided to each device when it
was initialized.  The runtime power management code does make direct use of
these <tt>-&gt;parent</tt> links, but not very much.  It could just as easily
make use of explicit dependencies, just as it  does when there are
dependencies that are not reflected in the hierarchy.</p>

<p>
Possibly the biggest user of these parent links is the &quot;udev&quot;
utility, which
responds to device addition and removal events in a highly
configurable way.  This configuration can depend on information about
arbitrarily distant ancestors.  On the other hand, it cannot depend at
all on related devices that are not direct ancestors.</p>

<h4>What role for attributes?</h4>

<p>
Attributes are arbitrary details about a given device; they are
presented via small files in <tt>/sys/devices</tt> known as &quot;attribute
files&quot;.  The particular content and use of these files was <a
href="/Articles/378884/">discussed here
some years ago</a> and has not significantly changed since so will not be
addressed further.</p>

<p>
Each device is presented by a directory in <tt>/sys/devices</tt>; most
attribute files appear as files directly in those directories.  There
are exceptions, though, and while they are not particularly interesting, they
need to be understood.  These exceptions collect a group of attributes
together into a subdirectory.
The most prevalent such subdirectory is <tt>power</tt>, which contains
attributes relating to the power status of the device.  Every device
has this subdirectory.</p>

<p>
The second most prevalent on the machine on which I am typing are the
<tt>capabilities</tt> and <tt>id</tt> subdirectories that various devices in the
<tt>input</tt> class contain.  Additionally, <tt>cpu</tt> devices can have
a two-level attribute 
tree with <tt>state</tt> directories in a <tt>cpuidle</tt> directory.

The important point here is that, when you find a directory in the
<tt>devices</tt> tree, it might just be a collection of attributes.  The
reason why they have been collected will vary from case to case.</p>

<p>
Note that &quot;classes&quot; and &quot;buses&quot; can also have attributes.  These affect
the whole subsystem and so are somewhat similar to module parameters.
They do not appear in &quot;<tt>/sys/device</tt>&quot;, only in &quot;<tt>/sys/bus</tt>&quot; or
&quot;<tt>/sys/class</tt>&quot;, so they are out of scope for this article.</p>
<h4>Managing namespaces</h4>

<p>
While Linux does have the <a href="http://www.lanana.org/">Linux Assigned Names And Numbers Authority</a>,
that authority does not oversee the assignment of names to classes,
buses, devices, or attributes.  In generally we just have to &quot;play
nice&quot;, try to catch inappropriate duplication during review, and fall
back on the kernel complaining if a name gets used twice in one
namespace.</p>

<p>
Within <tt>/sys/devices</tt> there can often be names from distinct
namespaces appearing in the one directory, so it is worth knowing what
namespaces there are and what support there is for conflict
avoidance.

Firstly, there is a namespace for buses (<tt>/sys/bus</tt>) and another for
classes (<tt>/sys/class</tt>).
These are currently kept separate and are largely disjoint anyway.
On my laptop I find:</p>
<p>
<pre>
    $ comm -12 &lt;(ls /sys/bus) &lt;(ls /sys/class)
    mei  
</pre>

<p>
so only one name in common â€” which is more than I expected.</p>

<p>
Each bus and each class defines a namespace for devices that are
implemented by that bus or class.  Typically a simple syntactic rule
will distinguish between different types of devices in the bus.  So in
the i2c bus, devices that represent an adapter are &quot;i2c-%d&quot;
while devices that represent attached hardware are &quot;%d-%04x&quot;.</p>

<p>
Each bus or class, and to some extent each driver, also defines a
namespace of attributes.  A driver must clearly not define attributes
that conflict with names used by its bus, but different drivers on
the same bus could safely use the same name (possibly for different
purposes, though that wouldn't be wise).


There is also a namespace of system-imposed attributes, of which we
have already seen one example: the &quot;power&quot; set of attributes that is
imposed on every device.  Clearly subsystems and drivers must avoid
these.</p>

<p>
Reserving the single name &quot;power&quot; for all power management attributes
makes it practical to add new power management attributes, such as
<tt>pm_qos_latency_tolerance_us</tt> which was <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2d984ad132a87ca2112f81f21039493176a8bca0">added</a> a little over a year
ago.  This approach of reserving just one name as a directory to
minimize namespace pollution is also used to some extent to reduce the
risk of a device name in one subsystem conflicting with an identically
named device in another subsystem.  When this is done, a directory
named for the subsystem is used to contain all relevant devices of
that subsystem.  But this is only a sometimes thing, as we will

<h4>Bringing it all together</h4>

<p>
It seems easiest to describe the whole tree by starting in the middle.
Every directory under <tt>/sys/devices</tt> that contains a file called
&quot;<tt>uevent</tt>&quot; represents a device.  This file can be written to in order
to synthesize &quot;ADD&quot; events, &quot;REMOVE&quot; events, or other
events that can 
be processed by udev.  It can be read to show context information
that accompanies those events.</p>

<p>
In each device directory there is also a &quot;<tt>power</tt>&quot; directory of
attributes, as we have already seen, and often a &quot;<tt>subsystem</tt>&quot; symlink
that points to the owning subsystem in either <tt>/sys/bus</tt> or
<tt>/sys/class</tt>.</p>

<p>
While any device must be implemented by some subsystem, it may not
actually be linked into the list of devices for that subsystem.  For
example, the &quot;usb&quot; subsystem creates &quot;<tt>endpoint</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>port</tt>&quot; devices but
does not identify them as belonging to the &quot;usb&quot; subsystem;
as a result they
don't get the &quot;<tt>subsystem</tt>&quot; symbolic link and do not appear in
&quot;<tt>/sys/bus/usb/devices</tt>&quot;.</p>

<p>
A device may also have a &quot;<tt>device</tt>&quot; link which is of legacy interest
only and usually points to a recent parent, and (in Linux 4.1) an
&quot;<tt>of_node</tt>&quot; link that, if the device was described by
a device tree,
will be a link to the relevant location in <tt>/sys/firmware/devicetree</tt>.

Other files and symbolic links will be device-specific or
subsystem-specific attributes.  Other directories can be one of three
sorts of things.</p>

<p>
Subdirectories of a device directory may also be device directories if
the parent is a &quot;class&quot; or  &quot;bus&quot; device.
This case is easily recognized by looking for &quot;<tt>uevent</tt>&quot; in the child
directory.</p>

<p>
Subdirectories of a device directory may be grouping directories for
all children of a particular &quot;class&quot;, but only when the parent device
is a &quot;bus&quot; device.  So the bus device for the TCA6507 device
has a directory called <tt>.../i2c-2/2-0045</tt>, and it
contains a grouping directory <tt>leds</tt> that contains a further
subdirectory for each <tt>leds</tt> device.  This case is also easily
recognized as the child has the same name as a class, and its
children contain <tt>uevent</tt> files.</p>

<p>
Finally, subdirectories of a device directory can be grouping
directories for attributes and can contain arbitrary attribute files,
symbolic links, and further sub-directories, but no device directories.</p>

<p>
When a device has a parent in the device model, the parent of the
device directory will either be the device directory of the parent, or
will be an intermediate grouping directory named after the class of
this device.  When a device does not have a parent, there are a few
different possibilities.</p>

<p>
When a bus is created, it can indicate whether parentless devices
should be placed in <tt>/sys/devices/virtual</tt>, or
<tt>/sys/devices/system</tt>, or directly in
<tt>/sys/devices</tt>.
Classes don't have that flexibility: all parentless class devices
are placed in <tt>/sys/devices/virtual</tt>.  Being class devices, they
have an intermediate directory named after the class, and the device
has its device directory attached within that intermediate directory.
So md RAID block devices appear as <tt>/sys/devices/virtual/block/md0</tt>
for example.</p>

<h4>Summing up</h4>

<p>
&quot;Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity&quot; is a popular
formulation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's Razor</a>, but could equally be used as advice for
software development.  Unfortunately the current state of
<tt>/sys/devices</tt> doesn't seem to meet that goal very well as it seems
filled with multiplicity, though that is doubtless due to baggage that
has been carried along as the design evolved.</p>

<p>
Some of the multiplicities are quite valuable: having directories used
for both the actual devices and for namespace control seems very
sensible, though it is unfortunate that the namespace control is a
little <em>ad hoc</em>.  Similarly, having attributes that can be imposed
system-wide (<tt>power</tt>, <tt>subsystem</tt>, <tt>of_node</tt>), 
subsystem-wide, or per-device is a fairly natural choice.</p>

<p>
Other multiplicities are largely a matter of interpretation such as
the various ways of looking at the meaning of parenthood.  It could
be that the concept of &quot;parent&quot; isn't really well defined enough to
deserve to be enshrined in the hierarchy, but it does seem to be
useful to some degree.</p>

<p>
And finally there are the multiple subsystems (&quot;class&quot; and &quot;bus&quot;) and
the multiple roots (<tt>/sys/devices</tt>, <tt>/sys/devices/virtual</tt>, and
<tt>/sys/devices/system</tt>) that don't appear to add much value.  The fact
that there are so many places for parentless devices lends weight to
the possibility that parents aren't really as important as we might
imagine.  </p>

<p>
While it might be nice to have more simplicity, the more important
thing is understanding what we do have.  There is certainly a lot of
value in <tt>/sys/devices</tt>, even if some aspects are not as valuable as
others.  Understanding what goes where, which parts are important, and
which parts don't deserve so much attention, is really where it is
most useful to focus.  So while it might have been hard to describe,
for myself at least it was worth describing.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Thanks for trying to describe what is rather hard to describe. In all honesty I did not grasp all the details at the first read, but it will be useful to come back the next time I wonder about something weird in /sys/devices.<br>
<p>
The term namespace seems to be overloaded even in kernel nowadays. When the article talks about namespaces this seems to be a completely different thing than CONFIG_NAMESPACES. These are just discussions in different *namespaces*...<br>
<p>
Even if technically an unrelated thing, because of the name clash I could refrain from thinking about an issue I have wondering about recently. When working with containers (i.e. using CONFIG_NAMESPACES), the /sys filesystem is a major leak of information. If you mount /sys inside your container, the container learns many things you might have preferred to hide (in the worst case it might even write attribute files). Of course as the saying goes, containers do not contain, but still that's often our goal... <br>
<p>
Question: Is there anything in namespaces (in the meaning of CONFIG_NAMESPACES) that could a prevent a container from doing "too much" (either lookup or even modification) inside /sys? Would user namespaces help here at least in the modification case? (They are not enabled on my current kernel so I have not yet started to explore them. I remember there was another LWN article in the class "I might need to come back to it later" about user namespaces already more than 2 years ago... <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/">https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/</a>)<br>

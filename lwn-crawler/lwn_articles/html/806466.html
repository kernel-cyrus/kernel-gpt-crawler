<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 6, 2019</br>
           </div>
A "split lock" is a low-level memory-bus lock taken by the processor for a memory
range that crosses a cache line.  Most processors disallow split locks, but
x86 implements them.  Split locking may be convenient for developers, but
it comes at a cost: a single split-locked instruction can occupy the memory
bus for around 1,000 clock cycles.  It is thus understandable that interest
in eliminating split-lock operations is high.  What is perhaps less
understandable is that a patch set intended to detect split locks has been
pending since (at least) May 2018, and it still is not poised to enter the
mainline.
<p>
Split locks are, in essence, a type of misaligned memory access â€” something
that the x86 architecture has always been relatively willing to forgive.
But there is a difference: while a normal unaligned operation will slow
down the process performing that operation, split locks will slow down the
entire system.  The 1,000-cycle delay may be particularly painful on
realtime systems, but split locks can be used as an effective
denial-of-service attack on any system.  There is little disagreement among
developers that their use should not be allowed on most systems.
<p>
Recent Intel processors can be configured to execute a trap when a split
lock is attempted, allowing the operating system to decide whether to allow
the operation to continue.  Fenghua Yu first posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1527435965-202085-1-git-send-email-fenghua.yu@intel.com/">a
patch set</a> enabling this trap in May 2018; LWN <a
href="/Articles/790464/">covered this work</a> one year later.  While many
things have changed in this patch set, the basic idea has remained
constant: when this feature is enabled, user-space processes that attempt a
split lock will receive a <tt>SIGBUS</tt> signal.  What happens when split
locks are created in other contexts has varied over time; in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1574297603-198156-1-git-send-email-fenghua.yu@intel.com/">the
version-10 patch set</a> posted in late November, split locks in the kernel
or system firmware will cause a kernel panic.
<p>
This severe response should result in problems being fixed quickly; Yu
cites a couple of kernel fixes for split locks detected by this work in the
patch posting.  That 
will only happen, though, if this feature is enabled on systems where the
code tries to create a split lock, but that may not happen as often as
developers would like:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The split lock detection is disabled by default because potential
	split lock issues can cause kernel panic or kill user processes. It
	is enabled only for real time or debug purpose through a kernel
	parameter "split_lock_detect".
</div>
<p>
Disabling the feature by default guarantees that it will not be widely
used; that has led to some complaints.  Ingo Molnar <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191121171401.GE12042@gmail.com/">asserted</a> that
"<q>for this feature to be useful it must be default-enabled</q>",
and Peter Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191121130153.GS4097@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">said</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	This feature MUST be default enabled, otherwise everything will
	be/remain broken and we'll end up in the situation where you can't
	use it even if you wanted to.
</div>
<p>
Zijlstra is particularly concerned about split locks created by code at the
firmware level, something he sees as being likely: "<q>from long and
painful experience we all know that if a BIOS can be wrong, it will
be</q>".  Enabling split-lock detection by default will hopefully cause
firmware-created split locks to be fixed.  Otherwise, he fears, those split
locks will lurk in the firmware indefinitely, emerging occasionally to burn
users who enable split-lock detection in the hope of finding problems in
their own code.
<p>
Forcing problems to be fixed by enabling split-lock detection by default
has some obvious appeal.  But the reasoning behind leaving it disabled also
makes some sense: killing processes that create split
locks is an ABI change that may create problems for users.  As Tony Luck <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191121173444.GA5581@agluck-desk2.amr.corp.intel.com/">put
it</a>:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Enabling by default at this point would result in a flurry of
	complaints about applications being killed and kernels
	panicking. That would be followed by:
<p>
	#include &lt;linus/all-caps-rant-about-backwards-compatability.h&gt;
<p>
	and the patches being reverted.
</div>
<p>
Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191122105141.GY4114@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">is
not worried</a>, though; he feels that the kernel issues have mostly been fixed
and that problems in user-space code will be rare because other
architectures have never allowed split locks.  For those who are worried,
though, he posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191122152715.GA1909@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">a
follow-up patch</a> allowing split-lock detection to be controlled at boot
time and adding a "warn-only" mode that doesn't actually kill any
processes.
<p>
In that patch set, he noted that "<q>it requires we get the kernel and
firmware clean</q>", and said that fixing up the kernel should be
"<q>pretty simple</q>".  But it turns out to be perhaps not quite
that simple after all.  In particular, there is the problem <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/3481175cbe14457a947f934343946d52@AcuMS.aculab.com/">pointed
out</a> by David Laight: the kernel's <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/atomic_ops.html#atomic-bitmask">atomic
bitmask functions</a> can easily create split-lock operations.  The core
problem here is that the type of a bitmask is defined as <tt>unsigned
long</tt>, but it's natural for developers to use a simple <tt>int</tt>
instead.  In such cases, the creation of misaligned accesses is easy, and
those accesses may occasionally span a cache-line boundary and lead to
split locks.
<p>
Opinions on how to solve this problem globally vary.  Yu posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191121185303.GB199273@romley-ivt3.sc.intel.com/">a
complex series of cases</a> meant to make atomic bit operations work for
almost all usage patterns, but that strikes some as too much complexity;
Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191121201951.GY4097@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">said</a>
simply that this solution is "<q>never going to happen</q>".  An
alternative, <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CALCETrW+qxrE633qetS4c1Rn2AX_hk5OgneZRtoZPFN1J395Ng@mail.gmail.com/">suggested</a>
by Andy Lutomirski, is to change the atomic bit operations to work on
32-bit values.  That would, obviously, limit the number of bits that could
be manipulated to&nbsp;32.  Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191121195634.GV4097@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/">noted</a>
that some architectures (alpha, ia64) already implement atomic bit
operations that way, so it may well be that 32&nbsp;bits is all that the
kernel needs.
<p>
There is one other "wrinkle", <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20190925180931.GG31852@linux.intel.com/">according to
Sean Christopherson</a>, getting in the way of merging split-lock
detection: the processor bit that controls split-lock detection affects the
entire core on which it's set, not just the specific CPU that sets it.  So
toggling split-lock detection will affect all hyperthreaded siblings
together.  This particular wrinkle was only discovered in September, after
the split-lock patch set had already been through nine revisions, leaving
the development community less than fully impressed.  But now that this
behavior is known, it must be dealt with in the kernel.
<p>
If split-lock detection is enabled globally, there is no problem.  But if
there is a desire to enable and disable it at specific times, things may
well not work as expected.  Things get particularly difficult when
virtualization is involved; guest systems may differ with each other â€” or
with the host â€” about whether split-lock detection should be enabled.
Potential solutions to this problem include disallowing control of
split-lock detection in guests (the current solution) or only allowing it
when hyperthreading is disabled.  Nobody has yet suggested using <a
href="/Articles/799454/">core scheduling</a> to ensure that all processes
running on a given core are in agreement about split-lock detection, but
it's only a matter of time.
<p>
All of this adds up to a useful feature that is apparently not yet ready
for prime time.  The question at this point is whether it should be merged
soon and improved in place, or whether it needs more work out of tree.
Perhaps both things could happen, since 5.6 is the earliest time it could
be pulled into the mainline at this point.  Split-lock detection exists to
eliminate unwanted delays, but it still seems subject to some delays
itself.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

<p>
There are two statements too simplistic to be true in this single sentence:<br>
<p>
- "Everything" implies the subset of users who would explicitly turn the feature on is exactly zero.<br>
- "Remain" implies the default setting can never be changed in the future after the feature is merged and - for instance - some transition period.<br>
<p>
The ability to predict the future is impressive, the ability to predict it with so much precision is even more.<br>
<p>
Nuances maybe?<br>

The logic behind that statement is: (1) most people use the defaults; (2) there's no pressure on fixing the bug if most people aren't affected, especially if those few people affected are using a non-default setting which can be turned off without visibly breaking anything else.<br>
<p>
That is, in the scenario where this feature is default-enabled, broken software will end up being fixed; in the scenario where this feature is default-disabled, not only will broken software not be fixed (there being no pressure to do so), but also there will be pressure to never enable this feature.<br>
<p>
Personally, I think this feature should be enabled by default, since it's a security fix against a local DoS issue, with a compatibility knob for those running systems with trusted but buggy software.<br>

Why write "everyone" if/when you mean "most"? Considering the main question is "how many?", it gives the impression that one hasn't really thought about it.<br>
<p>
There are cases where the difference between "all" and "most" doesn't matter. But here it does because it takes very few early adopters to find bugs. Even fewer if they're running a data center.<br>

How's any of that worse than not merging the code at all?<br>

Is blocking the code itself merely used as leverage in the discussion about the default setting?<br>

      The signal only affects the process creating the split lock. The slowdown affects the entire system...

The nuances are not lost on Zijlstra; they've been covered elsewhere in the thread. His point is correct though: split-locks cause huge latencies, which are only going to get worse, and nobody's gonna fix anything until the plug's been pulled.<br>
<p>
(ATI's graphics drivers still relied on the BKL despite YEARS of advanced warning that it was going away. When the BKL was fully removed, I couldn't upgrade my kernel; I think I waited 3 kernel releases before saying "screw it" and selling all my ATI/AMD gear in favor of Nvidia. Pull the plug. Break the bad things. It's the only way to make progress happen.)<br>

This seems like an extreme overkill reaction to something that, as described, doesn't sound much worse than x86 BIOS/UEFI crapware stalling ring 0 and above at bad times. Which we've dealt with for a *long* time.<br>
<p>
So maybe there's something else going on here that Intel's not telling us.<br>

I think I read cloud providers are the main force pushing for this. If it only takes a single thread busy-looping on a split-lock to stall the other 0xXX cores of your expensive hardware, you can suddenly annoy a whole lot of people for not a whole lot of money. Talk about noisy neighbors.<br>

So it might be a nice feature to be able to enable specifically on cloud servers. However, I am sure all desktop/laptop users with less than optimal firmware implementations and little chance of getting their firmware fixed will be thrilled by the thought of kernel panics starting to appear out of nowhere.<br>
<p>
Furthermore people will have little sympathy of their trusty old applications suddenly being killed with SIGBUS errors due to some new standards of performance and "correctness".<br>
<p>
Hopefully I am misunderstanding how this is supposed to work...<br>

I foresee it getting reverted about one week after it gets exposed to a wide range of users, unless it is optional.  It is almost certain that enough embedded crapware (aka firmware) and x86-only commercial applications out there will trigger split locking.<br>
<p>
Not to mention truly ancient stuff that runs under DOSEMU and friends...<br>
<p>
So, I bet one will be able to disable this "feature" in its final form during boot, if not at any time...<br>

Truly ancient stuff is not going to use locked instructions at all (except perhaps XCHG which got an automatic LOCK prefix with the 386, but even that is quite unlikely)<br>

It would have to be optional as not every environment will be capabale of being 100% clean.<br>
<p>
I would expect distributions to either have this turned off on Desktop installs or have their installer have a blacklist for firmware versions.<br>
<p>
However for commercial environments would they not test first? <br>
<p>
Surely all commercial environments are agile pipeline driven environments who break early and can fix things instantly? :-&gt;&gt;<br>

A lot of commercial environments are agile but many of them build up vast piles of low priority bugs which never get fixed. In many agile environments is hard to fix code which sorts vast buffers with bubble sort because the code works. Customers can't see the source code and therefore won't be aware of this problem.<br>
<p>
Tasks like fixing spelling mistakes, especially those in comments, become almost impossible.<br>
<p>
The only way agile environments will be made to fix split locks is for them to cause something very bad to happen somewhere they care about. A demonstration that an allegedly safe interface to root allowed anybody to read /etc/shadow was required to get time to fix it.<br>
<p>
As you might expect no customers where told anything and no fix issued.  I will neither confirm nor deny any suggestions about the company or product involved.<br>

It actually sounds like DoSing a cloud provider this way would be an easy task, requiring to continuously create split-locks just on a single thread of a hyperthreaded core. Would that affect just one NUMA node or all of them?<br>

Maybe, but the issue could be caused by a faulty software or a hacked VM. Contract termination seems as a last resort, e.g. in case the customer does not cooperate. However, in the meantime there can be a huge performance issue caused to many others.<br>
E.g. if I run 100 faulty worker nodes, spread over 100 random hosts, each host having 48 CPU cores (96 vCPU's due to hyperthreading/SMT), that looks like a potentially significant issue.<br>

Since the most interested parties are the cloud providers... why not let them lead the pack and test this feature until BIOSes and other funny firmware stabilizes?<br>

After that, it may be time to declare it the default!<br>

IOW: why should everyone else play guinea pigs to the benefit of the cloud providers?<br>

Memory control groups exist to track and limit the amount of memory used by
sets of processes.  Normally, one would not expect that memory used by one
group would be charged to another but, as Shakeel Butt described in a
memory-management track session at the 2019 Linux Storage, Filesystem, and
Memory-Management Summit, that does happen in a number of different
situations.  It's often a problem, but occasionally it's also a useful
feature.
<p>
One of the most common examples of this sort of "remote charging" happens
when a page of memory shared by more than one group is swapped out.  When
that page is swapped back in, it will be charged to the group that
originally allocated it, even if that group has long since stopped using
it.  That can lead to surprising situations like a page fault in one group
triggering reclaim or even an out-of-memory (OOM) response in another group.
Remote charging can happen when <a
href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html"><tt>userfaultfd()</tt></a>
is in use; the
fault-handling process can be charged for memory used by the controlled process.
It is seen when
processes are traced with <tt>ptrace()</tt> and can even happen  explicitly
with a call to <tt><a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/mm/gup.c#L1045">get_user_pages_remote()</a></tt>.
At times, memory allocated in kernel space can also be remotely charged.
<p>
Michal Hocko asked about <tt>userfaultfd()</tt> in particular, wondering
how often the control process runs in a different group than the processes
it is handling faults for.  Butt responded that he didn't know, but that
the remote charging is documented.  Hocko suggested that running in
different groups was probably not a good idea in general, and said that he
would be reluctant to complicate the code for a theoretical use case that
may not happen in the real world.
<p>
One of the in-kernel cases mentioned by Butt was the allocation of buffer
heads, which can happen when writeback is triggered on a page.  That can
happen in the global reclaim process, as well as elsewhere.  Those buffer
heads will be charged to the control group that is being charged for the page
being written back, even if that group had nothing to do with the activity
that made writeback necessary.
<p>
One interesting quirk of remote charging is that it bypasses the
<tt>memory.high</tt> control knob, which defines when an allocating process
should be throttled.  That throttling will not happen on allocations that
are remotely charged.  Rik van Riel asked how often this problem comes
about; Butt didn't have a precise answer but said that he had seen it.
Hocko said that if 1% of allocations are remotely charged in this way it
really doesn't matter; the processes within the control group will
eventually be charged directly for a page and the throttling will happen.
In more unbalanced cases it could be a problem, though.
<p>
In some cases there might actually be a use case for remote charging,
though.  Some users want to separate virtualized workloads, with
the virtual-machine monitor running in a different group than the virtual
machines themselves.  This is evidently done mostly as a way of knowing what
the monitor overhead is.  The way this is done currently is to create a
tmpfs filesystem and mount it in its own control group; all pages allocated
will then be charged to that group.  There's just one little problem: if
the virtual machine dies (from the OOM killer, for example) the
tmpfs filesystem will remain, consuming memory.  To deal with that, the
kernel has been hacked to send a special notification on OOM kills so that
somebody can go and clean up the tmpfs files.
<p>
Butt described a new idea that he has been working on: the tmpfs files
could be attached to a special dummy process that is subject to the
out-of-memory killer's attention.  When the process is killed, the files
are truncated; it's essentially an OOM-killable tmpfs file.  Johannes
Weiner said that such a mechanism was far too specialized to go upstream.
Van Riel, though, suggested that it might be possible to upstream a patch
implementing a new mount flag for tmpfs.  If the control group attached to
a given mount is killed, the filesystem would automatically drop its
contents.
<p>
Hugh Dickins said that problems with OOM kills and tmpfs are common, so it
would be good to have some sort of a solution there.  Weiner said that
perhaps the best place to implement it would be in the <a
href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/oomd">oomd</a> user-space OOM
daemon.  That kind of policy is hard to put into the kernel's OOM killer,
which exists primarily to protect the machine as a whole.  The
implementation of specific resource-control policies, perhaps, is better
placed in a user-space process.  At that point, the session wound down.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

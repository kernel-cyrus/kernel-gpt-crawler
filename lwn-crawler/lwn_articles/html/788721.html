<p>
In a combined filesystem and storage session at the 2019 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, and Memory-Management Summit, Avri Altman wanted to discuss the
"turbo-write" mode that is coming for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Flash_Storage">Universal
Flash Storage</a> (UFS) devices.  He wanted to introduce this new feature
to assembled developers and to get some opinions on how to support this
mode in the kernel.
</p>

<p>
NAND flash devices can store three bits per cell (triple-level cell or
TLC), but it is much slower 
than storing a single bit (single-level cell or SLC); TLC is generally two
to three times slower than SLC.  A new version of the UFS specification is
being written and turbo-write is expected to be part of it.  The idea
behind turbo-write is to use an SLC buffer to provide faster writes, with
the contents being shifted to the slower TLC as needed.  So Altman wondered
when turbo-write mode should be used.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/788848/">

alt="[Avri Altman]" title="Avri Altman" width=212 height=300>
</a>

<p>
Ted Ts'o asked what is managing the blocks; does Linux need to copy the
data from SLC to TLC?  Altman said that it was transparent to the operating
system; the device is managing the physical addresses and copies.  Ts'o
wondered what would happen if all writes were set to turbo.  That would
lead to endurance problems for the device, Altman said; sending every write
request through the SLC will kill the flash.
</p>

<p>
Damien Le Moal said that the developers need to understand about the
wear-leveling done by the device in order to make real use of turbo mode.
At some point, the device will have to ignore the a request for
turbo-write, because the SLC is full or due to wear-leveling constraints,
but without more information, the system cannot make the right decisions;
the driver for the device is best placed to make those decisions.
</p>

<p>
But Ts'o said that the kernel developers have to make a bunch of
assumptions because the devices (and their makers) do not give the
developers anything to work with.
The impact of copying the data to TLC is not known, for example; will that
affect read and write performance while it is happening?
 There are lots of unknowns, presumably
devices will have different ratios of SLC to TLC, which would have an
effect on what those decisions should be.
</p>

<p>
Altman said that the amount of SLC available can be queried, but wondered
if there is a 
policy that would make sense even without that information.  Le Moal
reiterated that more is needed beyond just the SLC capacity; in particular,
information about wear-leveling will be needed.  But applications will just
treat wear-leveling as somebody else's problem, James Bottomley said.  No
application is going to go slow if the only tradeoff is wear-leveling for
all of the applications using the device.  Ts'o said that the simplest
thing would be to make all synchronous writes be turbo and all background
writes done in the normal mode; it may mean that the device will only last three
months, however.
</p>

<p>
Le Moal argued that the driver is the right place to make the
turbo-write decision; it sees all the traffic, from that it can determine
the right course.  But Ewan Milne said that the decision should be pushed even
lower: into the drive itself.  This SLC/TLC split is meant as a performance
enhancement for high-capacity devices.  The device itself has the most
information about its state; the question in his mind is what the kernel
developers could even do to help.  But Ts'o pointed out that the drive does not
know if something is waiting for the write to complete, while the kernel can
(and does) differentiate synchronous writes.
</p>

<p>
Bottomley asked what happens when the SLC portion of the drive fails; does
the whole device fail or does it just degrade?  Altman said that it does
degrade, so Bottomley thought that the kernel could just set turbo mode for
all writes and it would be a fast device for a while, then turn into a
slower one.  Ts'o said that these flash chips are targeting mobile devices,
so if it goes slow after three months or something, the mobile-device
makers will not care because the reviewers will never test them for that long.
</p>

<p>
In the end, telling the drive that a write is a turbo-write is simply a
hint, the drive needs to make the decision, Le Moal said; it is like I/O
priority. But Martin
Petersen said he wanted to get up on his soapbox to point out that hinting
and I/O priority have failed; they are an "awful, awful way" to convey to
the device 
what it is you want it to do, he said. Indicating metadata or transaction
journal writes is something the device can actually use, but relative
priority has always been broken. 
</p>

<p>
Chris Mason said that from a practical point of view, the real problem is
that there is no success criteria.  His suggestion in the short term is to
wire up some of these ideas, define what success is, and then debate
various approaches based on that.
</p>

<p>
But Ts'o said that the problem is not as bad as for generic SCSI devices,
since UFS is only going to be used for mobile devices.  Christoph Hellwig
cautioned that "I wish that were true", but there are other classes of
hardware where UFS is being considered—though probably not for laptops, he
conceded. The point is that UFS devices will not be hosting Oracle
enterprise databases or the like, Ts'o said, so the device interaction can
be tuned for mobile-style workloads.   
</p>

<p>
Ts'o said that kernel developers are nervous about wiring things up in a
highly application-specific 
way, however.  The handset vendors are going to be driven by the device
benchmarks, which do not take into account things like device health and
endurance.  There are various hints that can be given to the driver; it
is up to the driver or the device to make use of them, Bottomley said.  So,
Altman concluded, the UFS device driver is the central place to make the
decisions. 
</p>

<p>
Bottomley suggested that the driver look at the synchronous bit and turn on
turbo mode for those writes, then benchmark the results to see how well it
works.  Ts'o noted that ext4 journal writes are marked synchronous,
which could be used.  The bigger issue is how to benchmark these
changes, there is a need for some kind of internal measure on how the SLC
is being affected by various choices.  Bottomley said that existing hints
could be used for now and if there are others that work better, they could be
added to the kernel, but only in a data-driven way.
</p>

<p>
Altman also wanted to discuss policies on when the SLC buffer contents
should be moved to TLC.  Ts'o suggested maybe flushing more aggressively
when the device is connected to a power source, when the drive is idle
would be another criteria, but the flushing decision also depends on how
full the SLC buffer 
is—those are all things that the driver or device should know.  As with the
turbo-write policy, the plan should be to prototype it and if it needs more
kernel infrastructure to work, then request it at that point.
</p>

<p>
To sum up, Altman said, both the turbo-write governance and the evacuation
policy should be handled by the UFS driver.  Ts'o agreed, noting that the
mobile-storage community has traditionally been resistant to putting more
smarts in the devices; if that were not the case, one could imagine other
engineering solutions, such as well-defined flush policies that the kernel
could choose from.

It would appear to be addressing a different market segment entirely, NVMe puts non-volatile storage on the PCIe lanes for v. high transfer speed minimising latency, rather than be driven by a HDD era I/O protocol.<br>
It sounds like UFS is intended as a way to use some SLC to speed up an inexpensive flash storage device used in mobile.<br>

A flash drive is a computer. It has its own OS, and exposes the raw blocks through a complicated filesystem implementing wear leveling and other features back as a block device to the main computer with a few commands via sata/scsi.<br>
<p>
This embedded OS typically suffers from the same problems other proprietary OS's have.<br>
Open source OS's usually doesn't have these issues.<br>
<p>
Why not (at least for a while):<br>
 * make the ssd's a dumb collection of blocks again<br>
 * make a linux subsystem for wear leveling the raw blocks<br>
<p>
This would leverage the power of open source and allow the the ability to tune the api between the wear leveling subsystem and regular linux driver / block device / file system layers in order to take into account things like SLC/TLC splits, write behaviors, scheduling flushing wherever the correct place for that is, without taking into account rigid api's. The correct api's can be discovered along the way.<br>
<p>
Perhaps once the api's have been fleshed out and work well for these sorts of things, then the logic can once again be pushed down right into the devices, but this time with an api designed not in the age of spinny disks, but for flash specifically.<br>

I think you'll find that Linux kernel developers would be mostly OK with this state of affairs, given that the device vendors expose enough information to make reasonable decisions.  However, device vendors have often proven to not be very fond of this approach.<br>

How do you implement this?<br>
Use LBA's on top of a flash drive, which ASSUMES it's formatted in vfat, treating the area used by MFT separately?<br>
More general purpose drives, still compete and differentiate on controller &amp; intetnal druve smarts.<br>
Suppose a vendor co-operates, their drive has immature Linux only management code tied to the exact OS version.  How do you sell that?<br>
What you want is Open Hardware with Open Firmware for Open OSes but purchasers don't fund such development, they buy based on short term performance/convenience considerations.<br>

This has been attempted several times and is, in essence what Open Channel and Lightnvm attempt to do. <br>
<p>
The challenge is that there is a lot of secret sauce in the firmware of a modern SSD and no vendor is willing to open that up to the world. Also such a SSD would need to reveal low level details of the NAND that the NAND vendors are not willing to do either. <br>

I'm not sure that Linux has a filesystem suitable for MLC or QLC flash.<br>
As I understand it ubifs has given up supporting MLC and one presumes QLC would have even more problems.<br>
<p>
This patch causes ubifs to refuse to handle MLC flash rather than allow people to build systems that would be unreliable (i.e. using UBIFS on top of MLC).<br>

This mailing list item talks about ubihealthd (never merged into mtd-utils) which was a proposal for handling less reliable NAND.<br>

Happy to be updated/proven wrong :-)<br>

That face when your brain is old enough it thinks "Unix FS?" when you see the title "Supporting the UFS turbo-write mode" 🧐<br>

Isn't that the exact same situation than SSHDs?<br>
<p>
Why don't SSHDs need a "turbo mode"? Because they're more expensive so there was enough money for a complete firmware implementation?<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; There are lots of unknowns, presumably devices will have different ratios of SLC to TLC, which would have an effect on what those decisions should be.</font><br>
<p>
Yeah, who's in charge here? It should be either the drive or the driver but not shared across with a ridiculously poor exchange of information between the two... Maybe the UFS standard body has been infiltrated by NVMe members? :-)<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Ts'o said that these flash chips are targeting mobile devices, so if it goes slow after three months or something, the mobile-device makers will not care because the reviewers will never test them for that long.</font><br>
<p>
Priceless, thanks :-)<br>
<p>
More seriously: pretty much every such reviewer has already complained about mobile devices slowing down over time. It looks like with cheap flash memory you "got what you paid for" - even long before "turbo mode" came up. I would really love if someone performed some before/after eMMC benchmarking some day, even a non rigorous one.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; Christoph Hellwig cautioned that "I wish that were true", but there are other classes of hardware where UFS is being considered—though probably not for laptops, he conceded.</font><br>

Most Chromebooks ship with eMMC.<br>

Also most Windows laptops with less than 100 GB of disk space. Admittedly, that is a very price-concious market, but if UFS ever gets to similar prices to eMMC, they would switch.
<p>
And Linux runs a lot better in limited storage than Windows 10.

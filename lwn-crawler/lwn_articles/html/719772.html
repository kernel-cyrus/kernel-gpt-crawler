<p>
At the <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/vault">2017 Vault</a> storage conference, Amir Goldstein gave a talk about
using <a href="/Articles/403012/">overlayfs</a> in a novel way to
create snapshots for the underlying filesystem.  His company, CTERA
Networks, has used the <a href="http://next3.sourceforge.net/">NEXT3</a>
ext3-based filesystem with snapshots, but customers want to be able to use
larger filesystems than those supported by ext3.  Thus he turned to
overlayfs as a way to add snapshots for XFS and other local filesystems.
</p>

<p>
NEXT3 has a number of shortcomings that he wanted to address with overlayfs
snapshots.  Though it only had a few requirements, which were reasonably
well supported, NEXT3 never got upstream.  It was ported to ext4, but his
employer stuck with the original ext3-based system, so the ext4 version was
never really pushed for upstream inclusion.
</p>

</a>

<p>
One of the goals of the <a href="/Articles/708370/">overlayfs snapshots</a>
(ovfs-snap) project is for it to be included 
upstream for better maintainability.  It will also allow snapshots at a
directory subtree level; the alternative mechanisms for snapshots, Btrfs
or LVM thin 
provisioning (thinp), are volume-level snapshots.  Those two also allow writable
and nested snapshots, while ovfs-snap does not.  The "champion feature" for
ovfs-snap is that the inode and page cache are shared, which is not true of
the others.  For a large number of containers, it becomes inefficient to
have multiple copies of the same data in these caches, he said.  
</p>

<p>
Goldstein then moved into a demonstration of the feature.  In previous
versions of the talk, he did the demo at the end but, based on some
feedback, has moved it near the beginning.  It is a bit hard to describe,
however, as with many demos.  The basic idea is that snapshot mounts turn
overlayfs on its head: the lower layer, which normally doesn't change in a
normal overlayfs mount, is allowed to change, while the upper layer is
modified to 
cover up the changes made in the lower so that the upper has the same
contents as the lower at the time of the snapshot.
</p>

<p>
This is done using a special "snapshot mount" that is a shim over the lower
layer to intercept filesystem operations to it.  Before those operations
are performed, the current state of the lower layer is copied up to the
upper layer.  The upper layer is a snapshot overlay (which is different
from a snapshot mount) that effectively records the state of the lower
layer before any changes are made to it.
</p>

<p>
So the lower layer must be accessed through the snapshot mount, but the
upper layer is simply a regular overlayfs that can be accessed as usual to
get a view of the filesystem at the time of the snapshot.  Multiple
snapshots can be supported by having a lower layer shared between multiple
upper layers, each of which hides any changes made to the lower after they
were mounted (which is when the snapshot is taken).
</p>

<p>
These snapshots can work for any size of directory tree.  It will also work
on top of Btrfs, XFS, or another local filesystem.  The upper layer will
record what has changed, but at the file level, not at the block level.
One consequence of this design is that changing one byte of a large file
results in a copy-up operation for the whole file.  In addition, currently
only one copy-up at a time is supported, so a large copy-up blocks any
others. 
</p>

<p>
Some new features are coming that will address some of these problems.  For
the container use case, Goldstein said, the copy-up performance issue is
not usually a real problem.  But for his use case, with large XFS files,
copy-up performance is important.  So, for 4.10, a "clone up" operation was
added when the underlying filesystem supports the clone operation (as XFS
and others do).  The clone will do a copy-on-write "copy" of the file
before it is modified so that only changed blocks actually get copied.
There is also support for doing concurrent copy-up
operations that is coming in 4.11.
</p>

<p>
Goldstein presented a couple of different use cases for ovfs-snap.  For a
short-lived snapshot for backup purposes, an ovfs-snap provides a
file-level copy-on-write filesystem.  Changes to the lower layer trigger
the copy-up so the snapshot is consistent with the state at the time of the
backup.   The lower layer can be accessed at near-native performance, while
accessing the snapshot can tolerate some lesser performance, he said.
</p>

<p>
One could also use ovfs-snap to allow access to multiple previous versions
of the filesystem.  Multiple upper layers can be composed to create a view
of the filesystem at any of the snapshot times, while the lower layer
remains mounted and accessible.  Those snapshots are read-only, however,
unlike Btrfs or LVM thinp snapshots.
</p>

<p>
The rules for maintaining an overlay that represents a snapshot are fairly
straightforward.  Files must copied (or cloned) up before they are modified
or deleted in the lower layers.  A whiteout marking a deletion must be
added before a file gets created in the lower layer.  A directory in the
snapshot overlay must be redirected when a directory in the lower layer
gets renamed.  Finally, when a lower layer directory gets deleted, an
opaque directory must be created in the snapshot.
</p>

<p>
Taking a snapshot is a somewhat complicated process (see slide 15 in
Goldstein's <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/overlayfs-snapshots-vault-2017_0.pdf">slides
[PDF]</a> for more information).  Simplifying that process is on the to-do
list for the project.  There are also plans to support merging snapshots as
well as working on getting the code upstream.  He finished the talk with
the inevitable invitation to help work on the project; he pointed those
interested at the <a

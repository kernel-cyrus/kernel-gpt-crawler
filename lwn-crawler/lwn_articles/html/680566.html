<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>March 23, 2016</br>
           </div>
As of this writing, Linus has pulled 11,118 non-merge changesets into the
mainline repository for the 4.6 development cycle; just over 10,000 of
those came since <a href="/Articles/680121/">last week's summary</a>.  As
can be seen, the flow of patches can no longer be described as "slow."  A
number of significant features can be found in that flood of patches.
<p>
The most notable user-visible changes include:
<ul>
<li> Support for <a href="/Articles/667156/">memory protection keys</a>
     has been merged.  This is an Intel feature allowing user space to
     partition its memory into zones and apply additional access
     restrictions to each.  The system calls for the manipulation of memory
     protection keys have not yet been merged; they are waiting for a bit more
     review.  But keys will be used by the kernel in 4.6 to implement truly
     execute-only 
     memory that cannot be read by the executing process.
<p>
<li> Control groups are now namespace-aware; there is a new
     <tt>CLONE_NEWCGROUP</tt> flag to <tt>clone()</tt> to create a process
     in a new control-group namespace.  See <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d4021f6cd41f03017f831b3d40b0067bed54893d">this
     patch</a> for documentation on this new feature.  The control-group
     filesystem can also now be mounted within user namespaces.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/670231/"><tt>preadv2()</tt> and
     <tt>pwritev2()</tt> system calls</a>, which take an extra "flags"
     argument, have finally been merged, allowing for the addition of new
     functionality.  The first flag is <tt>RWF_HIPRI</tt>, which enables
     the use of polling for a high-priority request.
<p>
<li> Page poisoning has traditionally been a kernel debugging feature; it
     fills freed pages with a special pattern that is easy to spot when
     looking for things that went wrong.  In 4.6, poisoning can be enabled
     independently of the debugging options, and the "poison" value can be
     set to zero; this results in pages being simply cleared when they are
     freed.  This behavior, inspired by the grsecurity/PaX patches, reduces
     the chances of the kernel leaking sensitive data.
<p>
<li> The memory-management subsystem's thrash-detection code has never
     worked properly within control groups; that has been rectified.  The
     result should be better behavior when specific control groups are
     experiencing memory pressure.
<p>
<li> The integrity measurement architecture (IMA) subsystem now requires
     that its policy be signed, and the integrity of that policy is
     measured prior to loading.
<p>
<li> The ARM64 architecture now supports the "user access override" feature
     found in ARMv8.2.  It allows user space to be accessed (by the kernel)
     using ordinary unprivileged instructions that check the owning
     process's 
     permissions in the normal way.  That, in turn, offers extra protection
     against the kernel being fooled into accessing memory it shouldn't.
<p>
<li> ARM64 also now supports <a href="/Articles/569635/">kernel
     address-space layout randomization</a>. 
<p>

<li> The kernel's representation of general-purpose I/O (GPIO) devices has
     been massively reworked; the <tt>gpio_chip</tt> structure is a proper
     device within the device model now.  There is a new ABI for getting
     information about the GPIOs on the system, but some work remains to be
     done.  As Linus Walleij <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1a46712aa99594eabe1e9aeedf115dfff0db1dfd">noted</a>:
     "<q>We can now discover GPIOs properly from userspace.  We still
     have not come up with a way to actually *use* GPIOs from
     userspace.</q>"  See <tt>tools/gpio/lsgpio.c</tt> for an example of
     the new ABI; note that the old sysfs-based ABI is now considered
     obsolete (even though it has not yet been completely replaced).
<p>
<li> A process's timer slack value — the amount by which timer requests may
     be delayed to cause them to coincide with others — can now be seen and
     modified via <tt>/proc/<i>PID</i>/timerslack_ns</tt>.
<p>
<li> The extended BPF virtual machine now implements per-CPU maps for
     high-speed statistics collection.  There is also a new map type to
     store stack traces.
<p>
<li> There is a new network-control API called "devlink," intended for the
     setting of various parameters that are not related to any specific
     device class.  This protocol is, naturally, undocumented; some
     information can be found in <a
     href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7f66ee41566d00f80ed15c0cec0b237f7af8ac0f">this
     merge changelog</a>.
<p>
<li> The <a href="/Articles/657999/">kernel connection multiplexer</a>,
     which allows for certain types of higher-level protocol handling in
     the kernel, has been merged.
<p>
<li> A number of network-oriented sysctl knobs (<tt>tcp_syn_retries</tt>,
     <tt>tcp_synack_retries</tt>,
     <tt>tcp_syncookies</tt>,
     <tt>tcp_reordering</tt>,
     <tt>tcp_retries1</tt>,
     <tt>tcp_retries2</tt>,
     <tt>tcp_orphan_retries</tt>,
     <tt>tcp_fin_timeout</tt>,
     <tt>tcp_notsent_lowat</tt>,
     <tt>igmp_max_memberships</tt>,
     <tt>igmp_max_msf</tt>,
     <tt>igmp_llm_reports</tt>, and
     <tt>igmp_qrv</tt>) have been made network-namespace aware, so
     that different namespaces can have different values.
<p>
<li> The "local checksum offload" mechanism (described in <a
     href="/Articles/674943/">this article</a>) has been merged.  Local
     checksum offload speeds checksum calculations, making tunneled
     protocol implementations faster.  See
     <a
     href="/Articles/681048/"><tt>Documentation/networking/checksum-offloads.txt</tt></a> for 
     more information.
<p>
<li> Netlink support over shared memory segments has been removed; it has
     never worked correctly and there does not appear to be any user-space code
     using it.
<p>
<li> A couple of new filesystem <tt>ioctl()</tt> commands
     (<tt>Q_GETNEXTQUOTA</tt> and <tt>Q_XGETNEXTQUOTA</tt>) have been added
     to enable efficient iteration through all of the disk quotas on a
     filesystem. 
<p>
<li> The Btrfs filesystem has a new mount option, <tt>nologreplay</tt>,
     which prevents the replaying of the log tree; this can be used with
     <tt>ro</tt> to obtain a truly read-only mount.  The new mount option
     <tt>usebackuproot</tt> is meant to replace the existing
     <tt>recovery</tt> option.

</ul>
<p>
Changes visible to kernel developers include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> The <a href="/Articles/658333/">compile-time stack validation
     patches</a> have been merged, providing a tool that ensures that the
     call stack will always be valid.  The result will be more reliable
     stack traces for developers; this feature is also needed for the
     further development of the live-patching mechanism.
<p>
<li> There is a new function for freeing a set of objects:
<p>
<pre>
    void kfree_bulk(size_t size, void **objects);
</pre>
<p>
     It differs from <tt>kmem_cache_free_bulk()</tt> in that there is no
     pointer to a <tt>kmem_cache</tt> structure, meaning that objects from
     multiple slabs can be freed together.  There is a cost to doing things
     this way, though, so <tt>kmem_cache_free_bulk()</tt> is preferred in
     cases where it is applicable.
<p>

<li> The cpufreq subsystem, charged with setting CPU frequencies to match
     the current system load, has seen some significant changes.  In
     current kernels, it uses timers to periodically sample the load on the
     CPU and, perhaps, make changes.  As of 4.6, instead, the cpufreq
     governors will be called directly from the scheduler when things
     change, eliminating the timers.  Eventually the governors will also
     use the projected load information from the scheduler to make
     (hopefully) better decisions, but that is work for a future
     development cycle.
<p>
<li> <tt>sscanf()</tt> now has basic support for matching sets of
     characters using the <tt>%[</tt> operator (e.g. "<tt>%[abc]</tt>" to
     match any of <tt>abc</tt>).  Only literal sets can be
     matched; there is, for example, no special meaning for "<tt>-</tt>"
     within a character set.
<p>
<li> The new <tt>dtx_diff</tt> tool, in the <tt>scripts/dtc</tt> directory,
     can calculate the differences between device trees in a number of
     formats. 
<p>
<li> The generic code supporting encrypted filesystems has been moved into
     the VFS layer (in <tt>fs/crypto</tt>) so that it can be used beyond
     the ext4 and f2fs filesystems.
<p>
<li> The I2C subsystem has a new pin-controller-based bus demultiplexor
     allowing runtime selection between multiple I2C controllers.  See <a
     href="/Articles/681046/"><tt>i2c-demux-pinctrl.txt</tt></a> for an
     overview. 
<p>
<li> The "kcov" kernel code-coverage analyzer has been merged; it can be
     useful to ensure that fuzzing and other testing efforts have exercised
     as much code as possible.  See <a
     href="/Articles/681047/"><tt>Documentation/kcov.txt</tt></a> for more
     information. 
</ul>
<p>

At this point, it would appear that the bulk of the changes for this
development cycle have been merged.  The merge window will likely stay open
through March&nbsp;27, though, so one never knows whether something else of
interest might turn up.  Next week's Kernel Page will summarize any
significant changes that appear at the tail end of the 4.6 merge window.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

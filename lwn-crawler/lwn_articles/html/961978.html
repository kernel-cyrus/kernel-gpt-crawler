The <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures</a> (CVE) system was set up in 1999 as a way to refer
unambiguously to known vulnerabilities in software.  That system has found
itself under increasing strain over the years, and numerous projects have
responded by trying to assert greater control over how CVE numbers are
assigned for their code.  On February 13, though, a big shoe dropped when
the Linux kernel project <a
href="http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2024/02/13/linux-is-a-cna/">announced</a>
that it, too, was taking control of CVE-number assignments.  As is often
the case, though, the kernel developers are taking a different approach to
vulnerabilities, with possible implications for the CVE system as a whole.
<p>
CVE numbers can be useful for anybody who is interested in whether a given
software release contains a specific vulnerability or not.  Over time,
though, they have gained other uses that have degraded the value of
the system overall.  Developers within software distributors, for example,
have been known to file CVE numbers in order to be able to ship important
patches that would, without such a number, not be accepted into a stable
product release.  Security researchers (and their companies) like to
accumulate CVE numbers as a form of resume padding and skill signaling.
CVE numbers have become a target in their own right; following <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's law</a>,
they would appear to have lost much of their value as a result.
<p>
Specifically, in many cases, the CVE numbers resulting from these
activities do not correspond to actual vulnerabilities that users need to
be worried about.  The assignment of a CVE number, though, imposes
obligations on the project responsible for the software; there may be
pressure to include a fix, or developers may have to go through the painful
and uncertain
process of contesting a CVE assignment and getting it nullified.  As this
problem has worsened, frustration with the CVE system has grown.
<p>
One outcome of that has been an increasing number of projects applying to
become the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for their code.  If a CNA exists
for a given program, all CVE numbers for that program must be issued by
that CNA, which can decline to issue a number for a report that, in its
judgment, does not correspond to a real vulnerability.  Thus, becoming the
CNA gives projects a way to stem the flow of <a
href="/Articles/944209/">bogus CVE numbers</a>.  In recent times, a number
of projects, including <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/16/curl-is-a-cna/">curl</a>, <a
href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-is-now-a-cve-numbering-authority-cna-2790/">PostgreSQL</a>,

<a
href="https://policies.python.org/python.org/CVE-Numbering-Authority/">Python</a>,
and many others have set up their own CNAs.  The OpenSSF has provided <a
href="https://openssf.org/blog/2023/11/27/openssf-introduces-guide-to-becoming-a-cve-numbering-authority-as-an-open-source-project/">a
guide to becoming a CNA</a> for other projects that might be interested in
taking that path.
<p>
Corporations, too, can become the CNA for their products.  Many companies
want that control for the same reasons that free-software projects do; they
grow tired of responding to frivolous CVE-number assignments and want to
put and end to them.  Of course, control over CVE assignments could be
abused by a company (or a free-software project) to try to sweep
vulnerabilities under the rug.  There is <a
href="https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules#section_9_appeals_process">an
appeal process</a> that can be followed in such cases.
<p>
<h4>The kernel CNA</h4>
<p>
The kernel project has, for the most part, declined to participate in the
CVE game.  Famously, the project (or, at least, some of the most
influential developers within it) <a href="/Articles/290227/">has long
taken the position</a> that all bugs are potentially security issues, so
there is <a href="/Articles/704231/">no point</a> in making a fuss over the
fixes that have been identified by somebody as having security
implications.  Still, the kernel has proved fertile ground for those who
would pad their resumes with CVE credits, and that grates on both
developers and distributors.
<p>
The situation has now changed, and the kernel will be assigning CVE numbers
for itself.  If that idea brings to mind a group of grumpy, beer-drinking kernel
developers reviewing and rejecting CVE-number requests, though, then a
closer look is warranted.  The key to how this is going to  work can be
found in <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/2024021430-blanching-spotter-c7c8@gregkh/">this
patch</a> to the kernel's documentation:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	As part of the normal stable release process, kernel changes that
	are potentially security issues are identified by the developers
	responsible for CVE number assignments and have CVE numbers
	automatically assigned to them.  These assignments are published on
	the linux-cve-announce mailing list as announcements on a frequent
	basis.
<p>
	Note, due to the layer at which the Linux kernel is in a system,
	almost any bug might be exploitable to compromise the security of
	the kernel, but the possibility of exploitation is often not
	evident when the bug is fixed.  <b>Because of this, the CVE assignment
	team is overly cautious and assign CVE numbers to any bugfix that
	they identify</b>.  This explains the seemingly large number of CVEs
	that are issued by the Linux kernel team.
</blockquote>
<p>
(Emphasis added).  What this text is saying is that anything that looks
like a bug fix — meaning many of the changes that find their way into the
stable kernel updates — will have a CVE number assigned to it.  Bear in
mind that, as of 6.1.74, the 6.1 kernel (which has been out for just over
one year) has had 12,639 fixes applied to it.  The 4.19 kernel, as of
4.19.306, has had 27,952.  Not all of these patches will get CVE numbers,
but many will.  So there are going to be a <i>lot</i> of CVE
numbers assigned to the kernel in the coming years.
<p>
Back in 2019, LWN <a href="/Articles/801157/">covered a talk by Greg
Kroah-Hartman</a> about the CVE-number problem.  From that article:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Kroah-Hartman put up a slide showing possible "fixes" for CVE
	numbers. The first, "ignore them", is more-or-less what is
	happening today. The next, option, "burn them down", could be
	brought about by requesting a CVE number for every patch applied to
	the kernel.
</blockquote>
<p>
It would appear that, nearly five years later, a form of the "burn them
down" option has been chosen.  The flood of CVE numbers is going to play
havoc with policies requiring that shipped software contain fixes for all
CVE numbers filed against it — and there are plenty of policies like that
out there.  Nobody who relies on backporting fixes to a non-mainline kernel
will be able to keep up with this CVE stream.  Any company that is using
CVE numbers to select kernel patches is going to have to rethink its
processes. 
<p>
A couple of possible outcomes come to mind.  One is that the CVE system
will be overwhelmed and eventually abandoned, at least with regard to the
kernel.  There was not much useful signal in kernel CVE numbers before, but
there will be even less now.  An alternative is that distributors will
simply fall back on shipping the stable kernel updates which, almost by
definition, will contain fixes for every known CVE number.  That, for
example, is the result that Kees Cook <a
href="https://fosstodon.org/@kees/111925962939008804">seemed to hope
for</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I'm excited to see this taking shape! It's going to be quite the
	fire-hose of identifiers, but I think that'll more accurately
	represent the number of fixes landing in stable trees and how
	important it is for end users to stay current on a stable kernel.
</blockquote>
<p>
It is easy to get the sense, though, that either outcome would be
acceptable to the developers in charge of mainline kernel security.
<p>
However it plays out, it is going to be interesting to watch; popcorn is
recommended.  The CVE system has been under increasing stress for years,
and it hasn't always seemed like there has been much interest in fixing it.
The arrival of the kernel CNA will not provide that fix, but it may reduce
the use of kernel CVE numbers as resume padding or ways to work around
corporate rules and, perhaps, draw attention to the fact that keeping a
secure kernel requires accepting a truly large number of fixes.  That might
just be a step in the right direction.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

      I hadn't seen <a href="https://social.kernel.org/notice/Aeroz3uO3oYwL7Y5qK">this quote from Greg Kroah-Hartman</a> before posting the article, but it kind of reinforces the point:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
The "simple solution" for all of this is just to have open source projects say "You must update to our latest version, it fixes all known issues at this time".
<p>
That's what we have done in the kernel for a very long time, and I predict this fascination of unique identifiers somehow meaning something is going to go away over time as it's obviously not sustainable for anyone involved.

I know that's tongue-in-cheek kind of thing but backported kernels are not the panacea stability-wise (compared to LTS or even normal kernels).<br>
<p>
Plus, and that's the whole point, pulling a google and updating the kernel once in a bluemoon, using "critical" CVEs as an indicator for backports and most ARM boards not even doing that and giving you the finger are not practices that should be condoned. This kind of backporting gives you an illusion of stability and security (it does improve ABI stability a fair bit but at the expense of other things).<br>
<p>
I know the term has lost quite a fair bit of meaning but I'd argue the whole point of devop-ing is precisely developing ways to perform updates (and rollbacks) that are the most seamless so that your systems are always up and if something had to be rolled-back, gives you and your team the time to sort it out.<br>
<p>
If you do so often, it's only little bits and bobs you need to fix here and there. If you don't and use Ubuntu LTS, it's a full migration, with many arguments, tears and pain every time you switch to a new LTS. <br>
<p>
The debian model is catered towards sysadmins who install everything by hand once and generally would be in it very deep if any of their servers actually fell because of hardware or because config became invalid after an update.<br>
<p>
If kernel updates are all that is possible to really get a secure one (because backports require too much work), the Linux ecosystem will evolve. Debian, for instance, will probably track LTS kernels instead but will also ask the kerbel dev to be much more methodic with how changes are made and documented.<br>
<p>
The kernel devs' point is that CVEs are rubbish. A lot of them being redundant or not real and a lot of them downplaying the impact they have on the system. My current understanding is that backporting doesn't scale well. But we'll see how it pans out. In the meantime, if an "unfortunate" kernel upgrade has large business impact, try to think and implement ways to negate that impact. We are mostly using on-prem resources here and yet I can redeploy bare-metal servers as I wish and most our OSes provided automatic rollback should anything go wrong. That's the way to go, instead of complaining an update, any update, broke something in prod.<br>

Anyone who cares about that should run production canaries and do actual regression testing. Yes, the Linux kernel testing strategy is lacking, but why put the onus on the project to do what *you* care about ? Anyone can build and test for regressions. And even do that in advance for the -rc versions (stable or upstream), so that when the release comes, you already know if it's breaking anything.<br>

IIRC Kernel patches are supposed to have a "Fixes" annotation for... fixes.<br>

Does this mean the CVE generation part can basically be fully automated. But with possible touch ups for patches with bad commit messages.<br>

Yes it can, and that is what we are going to use for tracking when a problem showed up, and when and what branch it is fixed in.  CVE makes this very easy to consume on their side as they are using JSON to handle all of it, which while complex at times, is at least machine-parsable.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Famously, the project (or, at least, some of the most influential developers within it) has long taken the position that all bugs are potentially security issues, so there is no point in making a fuss over the fixes that have been identified by somebody as having security implications.</span><br>
<p>
It really feels like said 'influential developers' live in a world of their own and have never actually spoken to anybody working in a commercial project anywhere, as this is such a naive and disingenuous take that it is the most charitable interpretation possible. The point of the CVE system should in theory be (yes of course there's plenty of misuse and straight out abuse as noted in the article, those are all very real problems with the system) that it allows to quickly decide whether it's worth to drop everything on the floor and pay a large sum of money and disrupt all your customers to go and do a kernel update, which in most cases results in unrelated stuff breaking left and right, due to how regressions are routinely ignored upstream, and how backward compatibility is not really a thing that any kernel maintainer cares about, outside of the syscalls ABI. A bug that is knowingly exploited in the wild is very, very very different from any other random bug fixes that doesn't affect you in any way, and it's incredibly naive to pretend they are all the same. They are very much not for anybody running any production system.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; A couple of possible outcomes come to mind. One is that the CVE system will be overwhelmed and eventually abandoned, at least with regard to the kernel. There was not much useful signal in kernel CVE numbers before, but there will be even less now. An alternative is that distributors will simply fall back on shipping the stable kernel updates which, almost by definition, will contain fixes for every known CVE number.</span><br>
<p>
The third possible outcome is that, given shipping with known security problems (which is synonym of unfixed CVEs, like it or not) is slowly becoming the target of legislation in the US and the EU, companies will just stop using Linux in their products, starting with anything to do with government contracts, given it's essentially impossible to continuously update the kernel in production, due to how disruptive it is and also how often new versions break backward compatibility all over the place. Now _that_ would be a hilarious unintended consequence.<br>

I'm afraid it's going to be the last option. Greg, you're shooting all of us in the feet. While I agree that the CVE system is broken and needs to be completely rethought, this is not the way. It is going to backfire. I know that you think that everybody should be using stable; I beg you to go out of your glass tower and go see the real problems people have with the aggressive way of picking stuff for stable. Forcing distros to take everything and the kitchen sink that goes into stable (since this is what this is really about, either intentionally or as an unintended consequence) is not going to make the users happy. The quality of stable is way too low.<br>

Companies using Linux "for free" should hire fewer amateurs and more "real"software engineers who actually know how to:<br>
- write test code,<br>
- automate their validation<br>
- quickly test stable branches<br>
- bisect regressions<br>
- file good bugs<br>
 - [optional] fix regressions themselves<br>
<p>
You get what you paid for; if you don't pay for quality, then you don't get quality.<br>
<p>
[indefinite "you", not answering anyone in particular]<br>
<p>
If stable branches are full of regressions then _prove_ it. Overwhelm them with bug reports and... even more CVEs! The very first step is sharing _evidence_ of the problem, otherwise nothing ever changes.<br>
<p>
If nothing changes even after sharing evidence then maybe Linux was too cheap and too good to be true and the wrong choice for you. Either write your own kernel and operating system or buy a better one. Linux has been incredibly successful but many companies still do that. <br>
<p>
Whatever you do, before whining remember how much you paid for it.<br>

We need to look at why those amateurs are being hired.  It's not JUST in code this is happening.<br>
<p>
There are simply not enough "qualified" individuals to support the "I want it NOW" world we have.  And I don't mean in any given country.  So, it's become grab a warm body that comes close,  pay the going rate and pray.<br>

You're right: as long as the market is happy to keep buying buggy, insecure and unmaintained products that happen to use Linux then who am I to tell anyone to stop making them.<br>
<p>
But still: don't come and complain that some Linux branches are buggy when you got them for free and did barely any QA on them yourself. You got what you paid for.<br>
<p>
I think there is a perception problem because quality is even less tangible than lines of code. But good companies making quality products (Linux-based and not) know very well how much it's really worth.<br>

I'm sure the EU/US legislation will not force to fix every CVE. Instead companies should be held responsible if their product had actual security problems that impacted the customers.<br>
<p>
I would hope the criteria will allow cases where companies just need to ensure there are product is safe. That can be done by locking it down or by many other means. But if there is a security breach as a result of a known bug that had a fix available, but that was not provided to the customers. Then company could be held liable.<br>
<p>
And I think that will work transiently too. If the company in the chain did not apply the provided upstream fix, then they themselves should be liable to their customers.<br>

The problem that the CVE system solves is that it allows users to delegate the initial triaging to the CVE authority. Having millions of users do the triaging themselves from scratch is an horrendous waste of resources, and straight impossible in most cases outside of very large corporations with lots of resources to throw at the problem. Then with automation you filter out what is merely present in your product(s), and then your engineers do a final triage to see if it actually appliers depending on severity, impact and other metadata/information. This makes the whole process manageable, and you can self-certify that there is a sensible process in place to take care of security vulnerabilities, precautions are taken and so on.<br>
<p>
But if the kernel tries to game the system by flooding it with bogus CVEs - one for each commit as it was suggested - then the above process breaks, and suddenly companies shipping products will no longer be able to self-certify that. There will be short term solutions, and then there will be long-term solutions, which might very well involve at least recalculating whether it still makes economic sense to rely on Linux.<br>

I am cautious about the announcement. If the floodgates open but the result is useful, I hope that whatever tooling distros create to handle kernel CVEs will be public. And also perhaps it will encourage more people to do stable backports of patches that do not apply directly.<br>
<p>
If the result is useless, on the other hand, I will just stop suggesting patches for stable. *shrug*<br>

Yeah yeah, in the real world people refuse to go see their doctor because they are afraid they might tell them they have cancer or any other grave illness...<br>
<p>
The message is clear: you want security, you use the latest kernel (LTS is probably fine because fixes are backported there too).<br>
<p>
I do agree and I do think that if the plan goes through, the kernel devs will have to up their testing game.<br>
<p>
But at any rate, the time of the go-lucky approach of installing Debian stable and believing the system will never come down after an update is over. You talk about "real problems people have"... If you can afford a hardware failure or a borked package after such an upgrade, you can afford a kernel "failure". If you can't, there are already measures in place to handle those, "bad" kernel update included.<br>
<p>
And again, this will go both ways. I bet you we'll see a lot of investment in testing in the next couple years.<br>

What's the standard financial disclaimer... "past performance is no guarantee of future success"?<br>
<p>
I once publicly called out someone (who _definitely_ should have known better) for professional incompetence after they went on a "systemd is responsble for everything wrong with society!!!111" rant after something went wrong on a Debian 9 (I think) upgrade on a critical system.  A remote, (completely) headless critical system.<br>
<p>
...Because you don't do _any_ updates on critical systems without some measure of testing first.  Or, at minimum, some sort of reversion/recovery procedure.  While even basic (end-user) smoke tests would have caught this particular failure [1] the fact that there wasn't any thought given to recovering from an update failure (not even "remote hands" capable of hooking up and looking at the local console) was inexcusable.<br>
<p>
[1] Due to non-Debian-supplied software failing to start properly and systemd actually catching the failure instead of ignoring it.  <br>

      <p>Your anecdote links to a known change we're seeing in the software world: failure is less and less of an option over time. Back In The Day™ (for various values of back in the day), it was fine to depend on user complaints to tell you if a service was running or not. It was fine for anyone who could telnet to a host to be able to log in as root with just a plaintext password to authenticate them. It was fine for a system to have a few days downtime while broken hardware got replaced. It was fine for sysadmins to go digging in people's files just to see if there was something interesting in there.
<p>None of this is OK any more; arguably, much of it was never OK, it was just accepted because doing better cost more than people were willing to pay. But time has moved on, and we expect more for less money, and to some extent, we get it - I can pay someone like Fastmail for better e-mail service than I used to be able to get from an in-house server, backed up by improvements to connectivity (where my LAN might have shared a single dial-up link 30 years ago, I've now got high speed Internet that's faster than the LAN speeds I got 30 years ago, and mail protocols designed to cope with the latency added by going to an outside datacentre instead of to a machine on the 10BASE2 network).

Note that "for less money" in practice, means an increasing unwillingness to pay _anything at all_, because "something else is paying/subsidizing the cost of service"<br>

(And one of those "something elses" is our service provider snooping on everything we do, including our at-rest data, finding "interesting" things to monetize.  But hey, it's not "money", so that's fine!)<br>

Debian stable regularly ships upstream kernel stable releases. Which is a problem, as we found out a couple of months ago, as "stable" kernels are not stable at all and can corrupt your disks and require a reinstall and restore from backups.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt;The point of the CVE system should in theory be that it allows to quickly decide whether it's worth to drop everything on the floor..</span><br>
<p>
But that does not and cannot work for something that is as wide scoped as the Linux kernel.<br>
Even assuming the CVE does refer to a real vulnerability the impact is very usecase dependent.<br>
<p>
A local privilege escalation on a server providing shell acounts is probably a big deal whereas the same vulnerabiliity on an embedded device that is only running the intended software (maybe already as root) who cares?<br>
<p>
The problem is that CVE numbers are conceptually simple and hide a lot of the real complexity and nuances that need to go into their sensible interpretation and you end up with stupid policies that say "you have to fix all CVEs" (of course that's not directly the fault of the CVE numbers themselves but the way people try to use them).<br>
<p>
Giving  managers something they think they can understand and make decisions on when the realities are much more complicated is generally a bad idea.  <br>
<p>
Also in my experience updates in the same stable kernel series very rarely cause issues and those that ocasionally do slip though can be mitigated with reasonable testing. Updating to a new kernel release does need a bit more care and tesrting though. I think the risk of *not* updating is higher than that of updating, providing you do test to some extent.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; companies will just stop using Linux in their products, starting with anything to do with government contracts,</span><br>
<p>
Unlikely I think. At this point is there are few viable alternatives to Linux for vast swathes of applications. The alternatives generally either aren't open source and involve per instance license fees (making them either insufficiently flexible or too expensive) or lack the breadth of hardware support that Linux enjoys (making them unusable for many, partiuclarly in embedded).<br>

Of course it can and does, this is just the usual kernel developers misplaced exceptionalism and sense of grandeur. It's just some piece of software like many others.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Even assuming the CVE does refer to a real vulnerability the impact is very usecase dependent.</span><br>

And that's what the impact assessment and other data are used for, you are stating the obvious. "Does this exploit apply to our product" is the standard minimum assessment that everyone does.<br>

<p>
They break apart all the time, as soon as they involve anything that is not exercised on a couple dozens kernel developers laptops or desktops, and sometimes even there, like the disk corruption bug of a couple of months ago. New major releases are even worse, with userspace interfaces being intentionally broken left and right.<br>
<p>
<span class="QuotedText">&gt; At this point is there are few viable alternatives to Linux for vast swathes of applications.</span><br>
<p>
I'm sure the developers of all past software that was once widespread and then faded into obscurity thought the same at some point or another. It just needs to stop making economic sense to use it, and that's exactly what it will happen - back to being a toy for hobbyists. We live in a capitalist society, and all those companies that are directly or indirectly sponsoring the vast, vast majority of development feel no attachment nor loyalty to anything but their share prices and profit margins.<br>

That rule is a fantasy from a world that never existed. There is the syscall ABI stability, and that's about it. I still remember the scramble to fix pretty much every single udev rule in existence when the sequence of uevents was changed in an incompatible way. Or having to throw a way a bunch of stuff and start over when overlayfs was made incomaptible with SELinux. Or countless changes in the netlink protocol. And so on and so forth. If you really think "don't break userspace" really means anything, then either we have fundamentally different ideas of what userspace actually means, or you haven't been paying much attention.<br>

Seriously, write and/or maintain your own kernel/system if that sort of stability matters so much to you.<br>

Depends what you're talking about. As far as I know udev is (developer wise) absolutely nothing to do with the kernel.<br>
<p>
"Do not break user space" is the rule Linus applies to the linux kernel. And that is a big part of the reason linux is so successful. Who knows what rules the udev guys apply to udev...<br>

udev acts on uevents, which are a userspace interface exposed by the kernel. Some time ago the sequence of events for existing devices was changed in a way that broke pretty much every userspace configuration in existence, so userspace was very much broken. The answer was "shrug, deal with it".<br>
<p>
And that's a legitimate answer to give of course, it's their kernel after all. The problem is taking that approach _and_ then going around proudly proclaiming "we do not break userspace".<br>

Linus et al. approach the “never break userspace” rule pragmatically, with a kind of “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” thinking: If the kernel devs know of no actual userspace code depending on some kernel API/ABI, and if nobody complains when something is changed or deprecated, then this case is not in scope for the “never break userspace” rule; in the same way, if after the fact someone complains, the kernel devs are usually quick to roll back any change or deprecation.<br>

      Examples?  Preferably with pointers to the discussion around the issue?  I don't doubt there are places where the kernel community is failing to live up to its goals, but it's hard to make things better without some clarity about where the problem exists.

The other one that hit me personally was when overlayfs was made incompatible with selinux. And then there's all the times that netlink changed. And all the time uevents changed. And all the times sysfs changed. And so on and so forth. The reality is that "we don't break userspace" is a nice story that kernel developers like to go around tell anybody who's willing to listen, but it's just that, a story. They barely care about syscall ABI stability, and even that gets broken from time to time as already pointed out by another comment.<br>

Well. Technically you are right. The kernel frequently breaks interfaces.<br>
But in reality, systemd and udev are parts of the operating system.<br>
So I don't care that much, if the OS breaks itself. That will get fixed eventually.<br>
<p>
What I and most users care about is whether actual user applications break.<br>
And that extremely rarely happens.<br>
I run decades old binaries that work just fine.<br>
<p>
It doesn't affect my application, because the OS as a whole still works as before, after porting systemd/udev to the new interfaces. A combination of updated kernel and incompatible systemd/udev would never hit stable distributions.<br>
<p>
Therefore, do you have examples of real user applications breaking, that are not part of the OS?<br>

      As yes, the BIND/UNBIND thing was a big enough deal that I <a href="/Articles/837033/">wrote about it</a> at the time.  What I suggested there might still seem to make sense: rather than sniping at the kernel community from the sideline, work with them to improve the situation.  Let Thorsten know about regressions, preferably early enough to keep them from making it into a release.  Things can be improved.
<p>
I have to say, Luca, that I would expect a systemd developer to understand how this kind of constant badmouthing from outside can make an environment toxic; systemd has certainly suffered its share of that.  Why continue with that pattern?  A more constructive approach might work wonders.

These things do get reported, and they get ignored/shrugged away if you are lucky, and if not you get taken for a long ride. For this case it's explained in the link above as well. For the overlayfs case Google even went as far as sending 20 revisions of a patchset to try and restore backward compatibility, albeit optionally, and it was stonewalled: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211117015806.2192263-1-dvander@google.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211117015806.2192263-1-dva...</a><br>
Apparently breaking userspace can just be waved through, while fixing it requires "building a security model" and other extremely high-bars to be met. All in the meanwhile anybody using selinux needs to completely open up the security policy to make it work at all, of course, which I guess makes for a very interesting "security model". I could go on, but can't be bothered to look up yet more references.<br>
<p>
So yeah, trying and dispelling this myth that "the kernel doesn't break userspace" is pretty much all that's left. Reading blatantly false statements being made irks me really badly, especially when used to justify some potentially damaging process changes as it happened here.<br>

Quite honestly, systemd and udev also broke lots and lots of things about how the Linux operating system works.<br>
Administrators had to change tons of scripts, because some things suddenly worked differently after the distribution updated from classic init to systemd.<br>
<p>
But the correct answer to users complaining often enough is to "ignore it" or "shrug it away".<br>
Things work differently now. Get used to it. That's the correct answer surprisingly often.<br>
That's true for systemd and it's also true for parts of the kernel.<br>
<p>
What should be avoided is breaking changes that don't have positive sides. Changes just for the sake of changing and breaking things. That is bad and must be avoided. And it should always be considered, if a non-breaking change is possible.<br>
<p>
But if a change breaks things and at the same time brings big benefits (relative to the breakage)?<br>
*shrug*<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; Quite honestly, systemd and udev also broke lots and lots of things about how the Linux operating system works.</span><br>
<p>
Or in other words, different software work differently. Or, yet again, you are moving the goal posts. Because nobody ever said "systemd works in exactly the same way as your 1980s garden variety collection of shell scripts", in fact the idea was very much the opposite. Some compat layers for the main interfaces were provided, which were always clearly documented as sub-optimal and wonky and intended for transition purposes, and after 20 years or so we'll remove them too, with ample advance notice. But nobody ever claimed that every single workflow in existence would continue unchanged after switching.<br>
<p>
In fact, we don't even make absolute claims such as "we never break compatibility, period". From time to time we do breaking changes, and we try to announce them in advance, and for really impactful ones we try to get consensus on the mailing list first, and in rare cases we even try to help distributions migrate ahead of time to ensure the impact is nominal only - see when we dropped support for unmerged-usr last year for example - this happened in v255, and nobody noticed.<br>
Sometimes things break accidentally, and sometimes they get fixed and sometimes they don't.<br>
<p>
But what we most certainly don't do, is going around claiming "we never break compatibility", and I certainly don't use such a claim to start firing a bogus CVE for each commit that I backport to every stable branch I maintain.<br>
<p>
See where the difference is?<br>

The difference is that kernel developers have publicly committed to never breaking userspace. Systemd developers haven't.   It is the disconnect between the public messaging and reality that's causing the contention.  Not the changes themselves necessarily.<br>

Things like uevents, tracepoints, sysfs files, etc... were pretty much never part of that claim.<br>
Devs try hard to not make unnecessary breakages, but if a sysfs file disappears/changes or an uevent changes, programs have to deal with it.<br>
Has always been like that.<br>

Even syscalls have been removed in the past, breaking applications.<br>
BUT these applications always were very limited in count and usually part of the OS itself.<br>
<p>
Citation: Look at the sources.<br>
<p>
There has never been a thing like a general stability guarantee.<br>
It always has been a matter of common sense.<br>
If a change only breaks udev or systemd and nothing else, it might make sense to do it.<br>

Excellent, you have now demonstrated that my original post, claiming that there is no such thing as 'kernel never breaks userspace', was indeed correct, and thus 'just update to the latest' cannot be suggested as a solution to security issues since public interfaces will be broken left and right with no regard for backward compatibility.

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; The difference is that kernel developers have publicly committed to never breaking userspace.</span><br>
<p>
Where?<br>
<p>
Okay, I know Linus says "never break user-space", and he is very strict about it. But at the end of the day, shit happens.<br>
<p>
And there's plenty of kernel developers who *haven't* signed up to it. They just know that trying to get it past Linus is not a battle worth fighting most of the time.<br>
<p>
There's one big example I can think of, that had a rather nasty fall-out, in the raid world. So bad, in fact, that kernels were modified to have an explicit "fail to boot" config, iirc!<br>
<p>
Something to do with the fact that raid layout was accidentally changed. So you have pre-change kernels that will trash post-change arrays, pre-discovery kernels that will trash pre-change arrays, and post-discovery kernels that will refuse to access arrays without a "this is a pre/post-layout flag".<br>
<p>
Sometimes that's all you can do :-(<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Wol<br>

It's not breaking anything.<br>
<p>
If you have a policy that says you need to ship fixes for all CVEs, then that's a stupid policy. It just conditions vendors to refuse each and every CVE until it goes through arbitration (something proprietary vendors already do).<br>
<p>
What consumers of CVEs need to do is be selective, evaluate if the CVE is relevant, what are the effects of exploiting it, etc. and only then backport it to the product they ship that uses the kernel or other CVEs. Same for end users, if the bug is in an API that's not used by any software that is running, then, no, you don't have to install updates.<br>
<p>
The problem is that all of it requires actual work, not blind adherence to the policy, and it's for security, so the business also doesn't want to spend money for it.<br>
<p>
It's a complex problem and there are no simple solutions.<br>

Nobody I know of has such a policy, so that sounds like yet another of those made-up strawman that the kernel people pushing for this have conjured out of thin air.<br>
<p>
We rely on CVE metadata&amp;al to decide whether we need to pick a fix or not. If the metadata is bogus, because the kernel maintainers just flood the system with bogus CVEs, then we can't do that sensibly anymore, and the process is broken.<br>

*shrug*  You made an assertion such organizations do not exist (because you didn't know any) and used that to accuse others of making things up or otherwise speaking in bad faith.  You were incorrect on both fronts.<br>
<p>
You're free to argue that the current status quo has problems (or not).  You're free to talk about *your* experiences, and how proposed actions by others will have ill effects on you or third parties.<br>
<p>
But you don't get to claim that other people's direct experiences are wrong, incorrect, or irrelevant, and accuse them of bad faith for taking steps to improve the messes they are dealing with, "because you have no idea about either".<br>

Incidently, that company was that way because *EU regulations required them to be*.<br>
<p>
(They laid off my research team on the tail end of a major process/policy revamp brought about by new regulations soon to come into effect.  I was made to endure many training sessions about how those new/updated regulations affected every part of the overall product lifecycle, from early design to manufacturing to label placement/content to post-sales support to how end-of-life would be handled)<br>
<p>
So it's not "that company's problem" so much as "the problem of any company operating in a regulated space"<br>

I would beg to differ. How much software - that was perfectly good at doing its job - has been replaced by a FAR inferior solution because one bunch of suits with a big marketing budget schmoozed another bunch of suits with a big spending budget.

The problem is that in the real world, _hardware_ (and its configurations, and the expectations of the software running on top of it) is more complex than ever, and that requires ever-more-complex software to sanely manage it.  Decry that reality all you want, but at the end of the day, reality doesn't care about feelings.<br>
<p>
So I stand by my point.  You want "simpler/inferior" operating systems?  They already exist [1], and it turns out nobody wants to use them, or invest the (considerable!) effort needed to adapt/maintain them for their own needs.<br>
<p>
[1] Or rather, existed, having never grown beyond the "academic toy" status or long since confined to the dustbins of history.<br>

<p>
And how much software, having started out as an "academic toy", is now mainstream despite being unfit for purpose precisely because it's all the CS grads know?<br>
<p>
Pretty much all the software I swear BY, was designed and then built. Pretty much all the software I swear AT, was cobbled together and the cracks papered over. Unfortunately, properly designed software is a rarity :-( It's also usually older software which imho is still better in many cases than its modern replacements, which just aren't "fit for purpose".<br>
<p>
Even if it's only in the programmer's head, a truth table of all possible options leads to a far better program than a programmer responding "oh I didn't think of that" when faced with an end user pointing out the beedin' obvious! (And no, I don't expect the first programmer to *implement* all possible options, just the fact that they were considered in the design results in a far better design.)<br>

This is a pretty large blanket statement that definitely isn't always true. If it were as true as you claim it was, things wouldn't fade into obscurity or ever be replaced. There are plenty of conditions where replacing something is cheaper than continuing to use it. X is a great recent example.<br>

The more I've watched the conversations around this announcement, the more I suspect that the "middle path" outcome will be switching to using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for assessing the "applicability" of CVEs.<br>
<p>
There are currently no plans to assign CVSS scores from cve@kernel.org, so this may happen externally, which kind of puts things back to square one: external entities will call out specific fixes as "important", and the cherry-picking will continue.<br>
<p>
Honestly, when I would do security flaw lifetime analysis, I only ever looked at "Critical" and "High" CVEs (as rated by the Ubuntu security and kernel teams), since there was already such a giant long tail of "Medium" and "Low". E.g. see slides 4 &amp; 5:<br>

      <p>The point is that, because the kernel is a CNA, doing anything with kernel vulnerabilities requires you to either get the kernel team to issue the CVE number, CVSS score etc, or show MITRE that you engaged the kernel team, and they refused to issue a CVE number, attach a CVSS score etc.
<p>A CNA cannot block publication of CVEs in their product, nor can a CNA prevent a CVSS score being attached to a CVE it's responsible for. It just gets "first dibs" on dealing with the issue, but you can still go around them if they're being slow or obstructive. Most of the gain for the kernel is that this blocks the noise, because it blocks the zero-effort CNAs from issuing CVE numbers (or attaching CVSS scores) to a kernel vulnerability. These CNAs are the ones who'd happily issue a CVE for the same vulnerability in the source code once for each supported architecture, or put a 9.8/10.0 CVSS score on a vulnerability because if you have credentials to SSH as root to a host, you can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

Technically issuing distinct CVE numbers for the same vulnerability on different architectures would actually be useful to the people using the CVE numbers to judge impact, especially if only affected architectures get one. There is nothing worse than a security advisory for an issue you know can't affect you because you are using entirely different hardware (or in the case of non-kernel software entirely different host operating systems) to the one where the problem occurs.<br>

Maybe actually that would be the best way to get rid of the tiny portion of perpetual complainers who don't want to miss any single security notification but are upset when the most likely ones are going to be reported because there are too many. Or their level of expectations just means that they want for free something that costs a lot of man power and that from the beginning they should have gone with paid distros whose job is to invest more time in that triage.<br>

      <blockquote>Or their level of expectations just means that they want for free something that costs a lot of man power</blockquote>
<p>This underlies a lot of people's complaints about open source projects; you get something for free that's anything from 10% to 95% of what you need, and then complain that the remaining parts are expensive to do. They don't account for the savings when compared to licensing a commercial product in that; they just want the open source product to be a free drop-in replacement for the thing they'd otherwise be paying for, and they don't want to spend on it because then it's not "free", and the accounting gets hard.

Nah, this is the opposite: if the plan is to spend resources to flood the system with bogus CVEs, then just don't. Much better to not do anything at all, and leave security triaging to somebody else.<br>

      <p>That ship sailed a long time ago; the system is currently being flooded with bogus CVEs by "security" people looking to pad their CVs with a large number of discovered CVEs. At least this way round, the kernel controls the flood, instead of being flooded by other people's demands.

That's the narrative the kernel developers are pushing - it's complete nonsense of course. Yes there is some abuse, like with any other public input system, but it's nowhere near "flooding" levels. As anybody managing any distro can attest, the noise ratio is very low.<br>

I am part of a team that manages an internal distribution that, among other things, deals with CVEs weekly. Is that enough "street creds" to call bullshit?<br>
<p>
Look, every single Linux distribution has systems and teams to deal with CVEs and security updates. Of course there is abuse, of course there are bogus ones being raised. It is not 80%, it is not the majority, it is not flooding. Could things be improved? Sure. Flooding the system with a bogus CVE for every commit is not the way to do that, quite the opposite.<br>

Why is a kernel upgrade disruptive?  That seems like an indication that the application doesn’t have proper clustering support.  Obviously, that’s quite possible, but my understanding is that best practice nowadays is to ensure that rebooting a server is just not a bug deal.<br>
<p>
There are obviously many exceptions to this (HPC and embedded systems come to mind), but this seems to be the general rule.  As far as stable kernel releases breaking stuff, is that something that should be caught in testing, preferable before the new stable tree is released?<br>

I don't think this proves that having a CVE was "necessary to include the bug in older releases". The security impact was missed back in 2022; it's been assessed only now, and this process included filing a CVE. Apart from the affected RHEL releases there are likely millions of devices that have the issue.<br>
<p>
But yeah, I can see that it's a nuisance from the upstream point of view and I agree that assigning the CVEs proactively can be an improvement.<br>

It is true that most things going into 8.6 at this point are fixes for vulnerabilities, and it is true that according to RHEL policy CVEs are created for every vulnerability that is fixed and can affect customers.<br>
<p>
However that doesn't mean that Red Hat creates CVEs  *because otherwise the backport wouldn't be allowed*. For example, a serious bug in 8.6 can be fixed without a CVE, and a low priority vulnerability wouldn't be fixed even with a CVE. (Also, giving an artificially high CVSS would be against Red Hat's interest for multiple reasons—it gets noticed and decreases credibility, forces customers to scramble, and imposes stricter deadlines that everyone would rather avoid).<br>
<p>
I do agree that this is one case in which the new process can help, in multiple ways: 1) it makes it easier for distros not using LTS to identify candidate backports 2) it prevents confusion if Red Hat and friends do a late backport, and it gives a heads up to the upstream CVE team if Red Hat decides to assign a security impact to a fix a couple years down the line 3) it *may* provide impetus for manufacturers of embedded Linux products to get their act together and keep the f***ing kernel up to date, through either Linux LTS releases or distro vendors.<br>
<p>
So I appreciate the example. However, I think you're reading from it a gaming of Red Hat policies that isn't there.<br>

I mean... how do you want me to respond to this? Unless RH replies with a statement saying that the only reason they assigned a CVE to this is because they needed to backport a patch (and a statement that says "... for backport to older versions of Red Hat Linux ... " is not enough) to convince you that this is what is going on, then I'm not sure if it's worth discussing it here.<br>
<p>
Given that you feel that we should go for completeness around our CVE reporting, I'm more than happy to personally check the CVEs assigned by kernel.org against RH's kernel trees, and request CVEs for issues that may affect RH's trees explicitly from the RH CNAs.<br>

That escalated quickly, didn't it?<br>
<p>
We've gone from LTS maintainers defending kernel developers against bad CVEs straight to LTS maintainers using their new authority to make extortion threats towards independent downstream CNAs in the space of a few discussion points.<br>
<p>
It's no wonder there's a significant amount of distrust of this new power grab by the LTS maintainers. It will do nothing to lighten the CVE-related workload of downstream distros, and they seem to think nothing of using their authority as a weapon against independent, competing stable kernel products.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; and a statement that says "... for backport to older versions of Red Hat Linux ... " is not enough</span><br>
<p>
I've been working with Red Hat kernels for 15 years and I can confidently say that a CVE number is neither necessary nor sufficient to commit to old releases. For example <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?h=master&amp;id=18164f66e6c59fda15c198b371fa008431efdb22">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?h...</a> will be in 8.6 soon and it does not have a CVE.<br>
<p>
This statement was from someone who is clearly not too fluent in English, in fact the only way I can make *any* sense of the sentence is if it refers to the Bugzilla rather than the CVE. I understand that the grammar makes you read it like that, and I understand how this was annoying to you so I thanked you for showing it to me. But please concede that I might know Red Hat policies better than you, will you?<br>

Sasha's example is from 2024 but people have been complaining about the "file for a CVE" life hack for years...  I'm not in a position to know how common it is to do it in real life though.<br>

See <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata">https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata</a><br>

it clearly states that Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs) can be fixed in extended support channels.<br>

<span class="QuotedText">&gt; CVE numbers have become a target in their own right; following Goodhart's law, they would appear to have lost much of their value as a result.</span><br>
<p>
Thank you for the Goodhart reference. Like most people I had seen many examples of this law but I could not yet see the forest for the trees and now I'm finally connecting all those dots.<br>
<p>
Typical release rules like "no more than X bugs of priority Y" always felt subjective and artificial but now I understand exactly why. Priorities are by definition _relative_, so how could such rules make sense? If anything these rules should look at some absolute "severity", not a relative "priority", right? But in reality, the use of the word "priority" is  a incredibly honest admission of Goodhart's law :-)<br>
<p>
From at least that particular "metrics" perspective, security bugs are indeed just like other bugs.<br>

I had to check the date while reading this article to make sure it wasn't April Fools Day.  The only outcome of this is that kernel-issued CVEs will be ignored.  I hope there's some automated way to look up which CNA issued a CVE number.<br>

Users/vendors can pretend security bugs are not there today because there's no CVE published... but the bugs are there and they were fixed. The bad actors know this and track what changed. We know they're watching. Users/vendors not paying attention are big targets. Ivanti VPNs are an extreme, but real time example.<br>
<p>
If you want to keep pretending and hoping, just filter the kernel CNA out. Greg has been telling everyone for a decade+ the solution is to keep updating with the LTS kernel. If you've done the engineering required to implement that process, nothing changes. If you ignored him and others and are still pretending... government regulation is here+more_coming. Like it or not, I'm sorry to say this isn't optional anymore, and it's not just going to be the kernel changing. I remember the days of happily running my own FTP+SMTP server. Things change.<br>

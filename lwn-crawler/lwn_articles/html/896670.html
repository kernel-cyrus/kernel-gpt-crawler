<p>
The challenges of testing filesystems and the block layer were the topic of a
combined storage and filesystem session led by Luis Chamberlain at the
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmm/">2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit</a> (LSFMM).  His goal is to
reduce the amount of time it takes to test new features in those areas, but
one of the problems that he has encountered is a lack of determinism in the
test results.  It is sometimes hard to distinguish problems in the kernel
code from problems in the tests themselves.
</p>

<p>
He began with a request to always use the term "fstests" for the tests that
have been known as "xfstests".  The old name is confusing, especially for new kernel
developers, because the test suite has long been used for testing more than
just the XFS filesystem.  It is not just new folks, though; even at
previous LSFMMs, he has seen people get 
confused by the "xfs" in the name.
</p>

<a href="/Articles/896745/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/lsfmm-chamberlain-sm.png" border=0 hspace=5
align="right" alt="[Luis Chamberlain]" title="Luis Chamberlain" width=192
height=260>
</a>

<p>
He noted that it takes ten years or more to stabilize a new filesystem;
long ago he set an objective for himself to try to help with that problem.
One of the ways to do so is to reduce the amount of time that it takes to
run filesystem tests.  Along the way, he decided to try to reduce the time
it takes to test new features in the block layer as well.
</p>

<p>
One of the differences he has observed for fstests and blktests versus
tests for the
rest of the kernel is that their determinism is lower.  The KUnit tests are
"extremely deterministic", while the kernel selftests are highly deterministic,
though they do sometimes fail unexpectedly. On the other hand, fstests and
blktests are just the opposite; they can be "extremely
non-deterministic", he said.
</p>

<p>
One of the takeaways from his findings is that the time spent on "testing"
needs to be divided properly.  There are four separate parts of that, which
should all get roughly equal amounts of time: test design, tracking
results, reporting bugs, and fixing low-hanging fruit.  The kernel
development community is "actually pretty good at test design", but does
not really spend enough time on the other parts of the testing puzzle.
</p>

<p>
He has worked on the <a href="https://github.com/mcgrof/kdevops">kdevops
project</a> to try to make some of that better.  It uses Kconfig for its
configuration and allows users to choose between cloud or local
virtualization for bringing up systems for kernel testing.  But that was
not the topic of the session, he said, rather the topic is the lessons that he has learned
from that effort.
</p>

<p>
One example of non-deterministic behavior is an ext4 test that fails once
in&nbsp;300 runs of fstests.  When 
he asks filesystem developers how many times they run fstests in a loop, he
gets a funny look, he said; but if you do run it in a loop, you will find some of these
sporadic failures.  Another example was a failure in blktests one time out
of&nbsp;80 because of an RCU stall.  It turned out to be a problem in the
QEMU zoned-device emulation, but that false positive in blktests helped
track down the problem.
</p>

<p>
Another example was in the <strike>"block/000"</strike> "block/009" test in blktests, which would fail
once out of&nbsp;669 times.  It took around eight months to track down the
problem and reach a consensus on the fix.  Jan Kara merged a fix
for&nbsp;5.12 that could potentially be backported to earlier stable
kernels, but it would be difficult to do because the patches are complex.
</p>

<p>
Another failure that turned up in both blktests and fstests somewhat randomly is an
example of the low-hanging fruit, he said.  The error came about because of a
longstanding problem removing kernel modules; the test tried (and sometimes
failed) to remove the <tt>scsi_debug</tt> module.  The underlying bug will be fixed in
kmod soon by adding a more patient module remover, but it points to
another problem: fstests and blktests should not require modules to be
unloaded so that unrelated problems do not introduce sporadic failures of
this sort.
</p>

<p>
But others in the room said that it was important to ensure that the
cleanup was done correctly, for example with NVMe devices.  There was some
discussion of whether that kind of testing was truly useful and whether module
unloading was the right way to go about it, but no real consensus emerged.
Josef Bacik said that it was important to focus on "testing the thing that
we care about" and not to let unrelated problems muddy the waters by way of
side effects.
</p>

<p>
There are also some problems with the error reporting in fstests, Chamberlain
said.  There are two kinds of files associated with each test,
a <tt>.bad</tt> file and another in the Junit 
format, that do not always agree.  So both types of files need to be
processed in order to find the errors associated with a particular test.
Blktests is better in that respect, he said, at least partly because it is
a newer test suite.
</p>

<p>
Ted Ts'o said that tests with errors in one type of file and not the other
are simply test bugs that should be fixed; the test runners could perhaps
be changed to process both, as well, but the tests should be updated to
have 
the right information.  There was also some discussion of saving dmesg output
when there are test failures.  Bacik said that fstests has an option to
always save that output even if the test passes, which can be useful; Omar Sandoval said that if
blktests did not have 
a similar option, it would be added.
</p>

<p>
To try to investigate the failure rates of some of the tests, Chamberlain
runs fstests and blktests in a loop for&nbsp;100 iterations on each.  For
running fstests on all of the filesystems, that loop takes five or six days, while
the loop takes a single day for blktests.  Tests that do not pass for all
of the test runs can be removed from the baseline while they are being investigated.
</p>

<p>
Ts'o cautioned that there are
different goals for running these test suites, however.  A QA person who is
"trying for the platonic ideal of zero bugs" may have to do multiple runs
looking for bugs that only appear infrequently.  But, from his company's
perspective, it does not make sense to try to detect those kinds of bugs
since he does not have the budget to hire enough people to track them all down.
</p>

<p>
Instead, his testing focuses on running tests on the hardware that is being
used in production to try to find the kinds of bugs that will occur in that
scenario.  So Ts'o said he has different goals than Chamberlain does,
though the work that Chamberlain is doing is valuable.  Ts'o
said that he is trying to "maximize bang for the buck" to produce the
highest-quality kernel he can afford given his budget.  Chamberlain agreed
that there is a need to prioritize the work based on the goals of the
organizations involved, but as Ts'o noted, this kind of work requires lots
of resources.
</p>

<p>
Moving onto another subject, establishing a baseline for a new filesystem takes one or two months,
Chamberlain said.  Not having a public baseline for a filesystem should be
seen as a technical debt within the community.   But it takes time and
resources to investigate the test failures, so dropping failing tests to
establish a "lazy baseline" is needed.
</p>

<p>
Another problem that he sees is that tests that <i>should</i> fail for a
given configuration or filesystem should be annotated so that they can be
run and the failure verified.  But others disagreed, saying that known
failures should be turned into separate tests to demonstrate the correct
behavior. Bacik worried that it would simply introduce further uncertainty into
the tests.  The session ran out of time, but Bacik scheduled another
session later in the day to discuss other problem areas for testing.

I know the OpenZFS folks slam their filesystem for every changeset, but how much testing does BTRFS do? It seems like more comprehensive testing would enable a lot more of it&#x27;s spurious bugs to be caught and fixed.<br>

Each developer *aught* to run fstests or blktests, depending on what they are developing.<br>
<p>
Each maintainer runs these tests as well.<br>
<p>
To address low deterministic bugs however one must run the tests multiple times. That will vary by developer, maintainer and Linux distribution.<br>
<p>
Do the math for what you can afford to test and in what timeline.<br>
<p>
I doubt OpenZFS gets more test coverage than the aggregate testing of any real Linux filesystems for all Linux distributions ;) We all stand to gain each filesystem is tested heavily. If your filesystem is upstream you benefit from generic tests, there are tons. If you&#x27;re filesystem is out of tree the onus is on you. OpenZFS stands out as a wonderful example of loosing out of everything valuable from the standard Linux filesystems test experience.<br>

Ah, flaky tests! At $DAYJOB we have regular crusades against them, we declare victory, and after a while they creep in again. And it&#x27;s not because we have a bad engineering culture. Sadly, not all of them are fully under our control - some of them are integration tests with external systems, sometimes there is a hiccup in the environment. Anyway, I feel your pain and hope that others see the light and come to realize that it&#x27;s important to fix all of them :)<br>

To address some of those flakey tests one must rule out determinism in the other components first. So for instance:<br>
<p>
How often can you reboot a system without issue and ensure it comes up fine?<br>
<p>
The kdevops reboot-limit workflow test is designed to test just that. And currently I suggest distributions to aim for as many reboots a release allows per architecture.<br>
<p>
An oddball x86 issue has been reproduced with this test:<br>

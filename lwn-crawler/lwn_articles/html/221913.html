<div class="ArticleText">
Since the writing of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/220897/">last week's
article on fibrils</a>, there has been relatively little discussion of that
set of patches.  That silence does not mean that interest in the idea has
faded for now, however; instead, a couple of different approaches have been
posted for consideration.
<p>

Linus Torvalds got inspired to create <a href="/Articles/221914/">an
asynchronous system call patch</a> of his own.  Simplicity is the word to
describe this patch: it adds less than 200 lines of code to the kernel
("<q>I even added comments, so a lot of the few new added lines aren't
even code!</q>").  It works like this:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The new <tt>async()</tt> system call takes a system call number,
     arguments for the system call, and a pointer to a location for the
     final status code.
<p>
<li> The process's register set is saved, then the system call is executed
     as usual.
<p>
<li> Should the kernel call <tt>schedule()</tt>, meaning that the system
     call is about to block, the process will fork before blocking.
<p>
<li> The new <i>child</i> process returns to user space and continues
     executing there.  Meanwhile, the original process will finish out the
     asynchronous system call.
</ul>
<p>
The largest claimed advantage to this patch, beyond its simplicity, is that
there is almost no overhead if the asynchronous system call can be
completed without blocking.  The fibril patch, instead, always runs
asynchronous calls in independent fibrils.  Linus claims that almost all
asynchronous system calls can, in fact, be completed synchronously without
blocking, so he would really rather see little or no up-front cost in that
case. 
<p>

There are various issues with Linus's patch.  If the asynchronous call
blocks, for example, the return to user space will happen in a different
process - a change which could prove confusing to user space.  Only one
asynchronous operation can be outstanding at any given time.  There is also
no way to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete except to poll the
exit status.  But this patch was never meant to be a complete solution; as
a proof of concept it is interesting.

<p>

For a rather more elaborate approach, Ingo Molnar's <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/221887/">syslet patchset</a> is worth a
look.  With syslets, a user-space program can run system calls
asynchronously.  Beyond that, however, it can load little programs into the
kernel and let them run independently.
<p>

To use syslets, the application starts by filling in one of these structures:
<p>
<pre>
    struct syslet_uatom {
	unsigned long		flags;
	unsigned long		nr;
	long 	 		*ret_ptr;
	struct syslet_uatom	*next;
	unsigned long		*arg_ptr[6];
	void 	 		*private;
    };
 </pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>nr</tt> is the number of the system call to run, <tt>arg_ptr</tt>
holds pointers to the arguments, and <tt>ret_ptr</tt> tells the kernel
where to put the final status from the call.  The <tt>private</tt> field is
not used by the kernel at all.  We'll get to the other fields shortly.
<p>
Once the <tt>syslet_uatom</tt> structure is ready, the application can run
it with:
<p>
<pre>
    long async_exec(struct syslet_uatom *atom);
</pre>
<p>
This call will start on the requested system call immediately.  If that
system call never blocks, it will be run synchronously and the address of
the <tt>atom</tt> will be returned from <tt>async_exec()</tt>.  Otherwise
the kernel will grab a thread from a pool and use that thread to return to
user space, continuing the system call in the original thread.  The
application can then go off and do whatever makes sense - including running
more syslets - while the system call runs to completion.
<p>

What actually happens when the system call completes is a little more
complex and interesting, however.  Unless user space has requested
otherwise, the kernel does <i>not</i> just complete the syslet after the
first system call runs; instead, it looks at the <tt>next</tt> field of the
<tt>syslet_uatom</tt> structure.  If that field is non-<tt>NULL</tt>, it is
taken as the user-space address of the next syslet to be run by the
kernel.  In other words, an application is not restricted to running
individual asynchronous system calls; it can chain up a whole series of
them to run without ever exiting the kernel.  The cost of fetching a new
syslet atom is far less than a transition to user space and back, so there
is a significant performance improvement to be had just by chaining two
system calls together.
<p>

The final field in <tt>struct syslet_uatom</tt> is <tt>flags</tt>, which
controls how syslets are executed.  Four of them
(<tt>SYSLET_STOP_ON_NONZERO</tt>, <tt>SYSLET_STOP_ON_ZERO</tt>,
<tt>SYSLET_STOP_ON_NEGATIVE</tt>, and <tt>SYSLET_STOP_ON_NON_POSITIVE</tt>)
will test the result of the current atom's system call and, possibly,
terminate execution of the syslet.  In this way, for example, a chain of
system calls can be stopped early if one of them fails.  It is also
possible to create a kernel-space loop which reads a file until no more
data is available.  
<p>

The <tt>SYSLET_SKIP_TO_NEXT_ON_STOP</tt> modifies the above flags so that,
rather than terminating the syslet, the kernel skips to an atom found
immediately after the current one in the process's address space.  This
flag allows a syslet to terminate a loop and move on to further processing
within the syslet.  If an application knows that a syslet will block, it
can request asynchronous execution from the outset with
<tt>SYSLET_ASYNC</tt>.  There is also a <tt>SYSLET_SYNC</tt> flag which
causes the whole thing to run synchronously.
<p>

Syslets do not have any variables of their own.  To help with the writing
of useful programs, Ingo has added a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    long umem_add(unsigned long *pointer, unsigned long increment);
</pre>
<p>
This call simply adds the given <tt>increment</tt> to <tt>*pointer</tt>,
returning the resulting value.
<p>

The application can register a ring buffer with the kernel using the
<tt>async_register()</tt> system call.  Whenever an atom completes, its
address will be stored in the next ring buffer entry; the application can
then use that address to find the system call status.  The kernel will not
overwrite non-<tt>NULL</tt> ring buffer entries, so the application must
reset them as it consumes them.  If the application needs to wait for
syslet completion, it can call:
<p>
<pre>
    long async_wait(unsigned long min_events);
</pre>
<p>
This call will block the process until at least <tt>min_events</tt> have
been stored into the ring buffer.
<p>

This patch set, too, presents a number of unanswered questions.  Once
again, signal handling has been punted for now.  There's no end of security
implications which must be thought out; in the end, a number
of system calls will probably be marked as being off-limits for asynchronous
execution.  There has still been no discussion on how this sort of
interface would play with the kevent patches - kevents seem to be concept
that nobody wants to talk about at the moment.  64/32-bit compatibility
could present interesting challenges of its own.  And so on.

But the initial reaction to syslets appears to be positive (though <a
href="/Articles/222168/">Linus hates it</a>); syslets might just point to
the form of the 
fibril idea which eventually makes it into the mainline kernel.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is why free software is special - he just assumes it can get into the <br>
kernel, even tough Linus doesn't like it. Consensus is so 'normal' in FOSS <br>
development you don't notice it all the time, but it's a great thing. It's <br>
the reason for creativity and the 'free spirit'. I love it. I wish more <br>
things worked this way... Politics anyone? I'm liberal by nature, and I <br>
think freedom will always find it's way. As long as there is a community <br>
watching it and protecting it. Wiki's, blogs, podcasts, they are <br>
transforming the world. I hope we can protect it from you-know-who (from <br>
evil governments to RIAA, from terrorists and other fanatics to greedy <br>
companies).<br>

Who is "he"?  Ingo or our editor?  If Ingo, he wrote the patch before Linus commented on it.  If it's the editor, please note the word "eventually".  I don't think anybody assumes that Ingo's patch can go to the kernel as is.
<p>
I think you are generalizing too much.  Other projects are run in a different way.  Consensus doesn't always work.  Although if developers are motivated to stick together, they will look for a solution that doesn't alienate any of them.

      In both cases the system call is done by the parent process and the return is the child process. Why can't this be done the other way around, where the asyncrhonous call is being done by the child and it returns immediately to the parent? That would make a lot more sense, so I assumme there is a sensible reason that I can't figure out for how they are doing this.<br>

      In his explanation it was so that the fork code could be reused with no modifications. He implies it could be done if it matters to callers.<br>
<p>
Linus:<br>
Now, I agree that this is a bit ugly in some of the details: in <br>
particular, it means that if the system call blocks, we will literally <br>
return as a *different* thread to user space. If you care, you shouldn't <br>
use this interface, or come up with some way to make it work nicely (doing <br>
it this way meant that I could just re-use all the clone/fork code as-is).<br>

      How could it _not_ matter to callers ? If the thread id can change arbitrarily based on factors outside of the applications control - e.g. if some driver buffer is empty - then the thread id becomes completely pointless.<br>
<p>
To me this seems completely unacceptable. Am I missing something ?<br>

      You are right, it's indeed unacceptable.<br>

      Has there been any discussion of canceling an asynchronous operation ? It seems to me that there may not be a structured way to do it using fibrils/kernel_threads because there are no formally defined states where a request sits and can be canceled.<br>

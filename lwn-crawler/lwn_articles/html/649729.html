<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/649115/">Previously</a> in this series we
explored the pathname-lookup procedures 
in Linux (and the REF-walk mechanism in particular), which are complex
because there are numerous details and 
special cases.  This time we are looking at a different part of the
process which is complex for a different reason.  The
read-copy-update-based RCU-walk mechanism avoids some
details and cases by simply refusing to handle them; instead, it just
falls back to REF-walk when it runs into something it cannot deal with.  It
remains hard to understand, though, because it is so 
unfamiliar.   In an <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/453685/">earlier
article</a> discussing this unfamiliarity I suggested that:</p>

<div class="BigQuote">
In human relationships a friendship can blossom more quickly if a
mutual friend acts to introduce two parties and start them out on
a sound footing.
</div>

<p>
A couple of months ago, Al Viro — the maintainer of the Linux VFS
layer — provided that introduction when he <a
href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/23/432">took the time</a>,
during a discussion of some possible changes, 
to put together a brief overview of the goals and mechanisms of
RCU-walk. He also suggested that it "<q>probably needs to be turned into
coherent text</q>"
and be placed in <tt>Documentation/filesystems/</tt>.  Not being one to turn
down the opportunity to translate brief notes and C code into English,
I took on the challenge.  The first part of this series provided the
context against which RCU-walk can make sense.  The next part will
detail the changes to symlink handling that were the concrete outcome
of that discussion.  This is the part where we make friends with
RCU-walk.</p>
<p>
RCU-walk is an algorithm for performing pathname lookup in Linux.  It
is in many ways similar to REF-walk, which we met last time, and the
two share quite a bit of code.  The significant difference in RCU-walk
is how it allows for the possibility of concurrent access.</p>
<h4>Clear demarcation of roles</h4>
<p>
The easiest way to manage concurrency is to forcibly stop any other
thread from changing the data structures that a given thread is looking
at.  In cases where no other thread would even think of changing the
data and lots of different threads want to read at the same time,
this can be very costly.

Even when using locks that permit multiple concurrent readers, the
simple act of updating the count of the number of current readers can
impose an unwanted cost.  So the goal when reading a shared data
structure that no other process is changing is to avoid writing
anything to memory at all.  Take no locks, increment no counts, leave
no footprints.</p>
<p>
The REF-walk mechanism already described certainly doesn't follow this
principle, but then it is really designed to work when there may well
be other threads modifying the data.  RCU-walk, in contrast, is
designed for the common situation where there are lots of frequent
readers and only occasional writers.  This may not be common in all
parts of the filesystem tree, but in many parts it will be.  For the other
parts it is important that RCU-walk can quickly fall back to using
REF-walk.</p>
<p>
Pathname lookup always starts in RCU-walk mode but only remains there
as long as what it is looking for is in the cache and is stable.  It
dances lightly down the cached filesystem image, leaving no footprints and
carefully watching where it is, to be sure it doesn't trip. 
If it notices that something has changed or is changing, or if
something isn't in the cache, then it tries to stop gracefully and
switch to REF-walk.</p>
<p>
This stopping requires getting a counted reference on the current <tt>vfsmount</tt>
and <tt>dentry</tt>, and ensuring that these are still valid — that a path
walk with REF-walk would have found the same entries.
This is an invariant that RCU-walk must guarantee.  It can only make
decisions, such as selecting the next step, that are decisions which
REF-walk could also have made if it were walking down the tree at the
same time.
If the graceful stop succeeds, the rest of the path is processed with
the reliable, if slightly sluggish, REF-walk.  If RCU-walk finds it
cannot stop gracefully, it simply gives up and restarts from the top
with REF-walk.
<p>
This pattern of "try RCU-walk, if that fails try
REF-walk" can be clearly seen in functions like
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n2119"><tt>filename_lookup()</tt></a>, 
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n2164"><tt>filename_parentat()</tt></a>, 
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n2438"><tt>filename_mountpoint()</tt></a>, 
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n3321"><tt>do_filp_open()</tt></a>,
and 
<a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n3338"><tt>do_file_open_root()</tt></a>.
These five correspond roughly to the four 
<tt>path_</tt>* functions we met last time, each of which calls <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n1859"><tt>link_path_walk()</tt></a>.

The <tt>path_</tt>* functions are called using different
mode flags until a mode is found which works.  They are first called with
<tt>LOOKUP_RCU</tt> set to request "RCU-walk".  If that fails with the error
<tt>ECHILD</tt> they are called again with no special flag to request "REF-walk".
If either of those report the error <tt>ESTALE</tt> a final attempt is made
with <tt>LOOKUP_REVAL</tt> set (and no <tt>LOOKUP_RCU</tt>) to ensure that entries
found in the cache are forcibly revalidated &mdash; normally entries are
only revalidated if the filesystem determines that they are too old to
trust.</p>
<p>
The <tt>LOOKUP_RCU</tt> attempt may drop that flag internally and switch to
REF-walk, but will never then try to switch back to RCU-walk.  Places
that trip up RCU-walk are much more likely to be near the leaves and
so it is very unlikely that there will be much, if any, benefit from
switching back.</p>
<h4>RCU and seqlocks: fast and light</h4>
<p>
RCU is, unsurprisingly, critical to RCU-walk mode.  The
<tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> is held for the entire time that RCU-walk is
walking down a path.  The particular guarantee it provides is that the
key data structures — dentries, inodes, super_blocks, and mounts — will
not be freed while the lock is held.  They might be unlinked or
invalidated in one way or another, but the memory will not be
repurposed, so values in various fields will still be meaningful.
This is the only guarantee that RCU provides; everything else is done
using seqlocks.</p>
<p>
As we saw last time, REF-walk holds a counted reference to the current
<tt>dentry</tt> and the current <tt>vfsmount</tt>, and does not release those references
before taking references to the "next" dentry or vfsmount.  It also
sometimes takes the <tt>d_lock</tt> spinlock.  These references and locks are
taken to prevent certain changes from happening.  RCU-walk must not
take those references or locks and so cannot prevent such changes.
Instead, it checks to see if a change has been made, and aborts or
retries if it has.</p>
<p>
To preserve the invariant mentioned above (that RCU-walk may only make
decisions that REF-walk could have made), it must make the checks at
or near the same places that REF-walk holds the references.

So, when REF-walk increments a reference count or takes a spinlock,
RCU-walk samples the status of a seqlock using <tt>read_seqcount_begin()</tt>
or a similar function.  When REF-walk decrements the count or drops
the lock, RCU-walk checks if the sampled status is still valid using
<tt>read_seqcount_retry()</tt> or similar.
<p>
However, there is a little bit
more to seqlocks than that.
If RCU-walk accesses two different fields in a seqlock-protected
structure, or accesses the same field twice, there is no a-priori
guarantee of any consistency between those accesses.  When consistency
is needed — which it usually is — RCU-walk must take a copy and then
use <tt>read_seqcount_retry()</tt> to validate that copy.</p>
<p>
<tt>read_seqcount_retry()</tt> not only checks the sequence number, but also
imposes a <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt">memory
barrier</a> so that no memory-read instruction from 
<em>before</em> the call can be delayed until <em>after</em> the call, either by
the CPU or by the compiler.

A simple example of this can be seen in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/dcache.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n2079"><tt>slow_dentry_cmp()</tt></a> which,
for filesystems which do not use simple byte-wise name equality, calls
into the filesystem to compare a name against a dentry.  The length
and name pointer are copied into local variables, then
<tt>read_seqcount_retry()</tt> is called to confirm the two are consistent,
and only then is <tt>-&gt;d_compare()</tt> called.  When standard filename
comparison is used, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/dcache.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n215"><tt>dentry_cmp()</tt></a> is called instead.  Notably it does
<em>not</em> use <tt>read_seqcount_retry()</tt>, but instead has a large comment
explaining why the consistency guarantee isn't necessary.  A
subsequent <tt>read_seqcount_retry()</tt> will be sufficient to catch any
problem that could occur at this point.</p>
<p>
With that little refresher on seqlocks out of the way we can look at
the bigger picture of how RCU-walk uses seqlocks.</p>
<h4><tt>mount_lock</tt> and <tt>nd-&gt;m_seq</tt></h4>
<p>
We already met the <tt>mount_lock</tt> seqlock when REF-walk used it to ensure
that crossing a mount point is performed safely.  RCU-walk uses it for
that too, but for quite a bit more.</p>
<p>
Instead of taking a counted reference to each <tt>vfsmount</tt> as it
descends the tree, RCU-walk samples the state of <tt>mount_lock</tt> at the
start of the walk and stores this initial sequence number in the
<tt>struct nameidata</tt> in the <tt>m_seq</tt> field.  This one lock and one
sequence number are used to validate all accesses to all <tt>vfsmounts</tt>
and all mount point crossings.  As changes to the mount table are
relatively rare, it is reasonable to fall back on REF-walk any time
that any "mount" or "unmount" happens.</p>
<p>
<tt>m_seq</tt> is checked (using <tt>read_seqretry()</tt>) at the end of an RCU-walk
sequence, whether switching to REF-walk for the rest of the path or
when the end of the path is reached.  It is also checked when stepping
down over a mount point (in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n1235"><tt>__follow_mount_rcu()</tt></a>) or up (in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n1279"><tt>follow_dotdot_rcu()</tt></a>).  If it is ever found to have changed, the
whole RCU-walk sequence is aborted and the path is processed again by
REF-walk.</p>
<p>
If RCU-walk finds that <tt>mount_lock</tt> hasn't changed then it can be sure
that, had REF-walk taken counted references on each <tt>vfsmount</tt>, the
results would have been the same.  This ensures the invariant holds,
at least for <tt>vfsmount</tt> structures.</p>
<h4><tt>dentry-&gt;d_seq</tt> and <tt>nd-&gt;seq</tt></h4>
<p>
In place of taking a count or lock on <tt>d_reflock</tt>, RCU-walk samples
the per-<tt>dentry</tt> <tt>d_seq</tt> seqlock, and stores the sequence number in the
<tt>seq</tt> field of the <tt>nameidata</tt> structure, so
<tt>nd-&gt;seq</tt> should always be the 
current sequence number of <tt>nd-&gt;dentry</tt>.  This number needs to be
revalidated after copying, and before using, the name, parent, or
inode of the <tt>dentry</tt>.</p>
<p>
The handling of the name we have already looked at, and the parent is
only accessed in <tt>follow_dotdot_rcu()</tt> which fairly trivially follows
the required pattern, though it does so for three different cases.</p>
<p>
When not at a mount point, <tt>d_parent</tt> is followed and its <tt>d_seq</tt> is
collected.  When we are at a mount point, we instead follow the
<tt>mnt-&gt;mnt_mountpoint</tt> link to get a new <tt>dentry</tt> and collect its <tt>d_seq</tt>.
Then, after finally finding a <tt>d_parent</tt> to follow, we must check if we
have landed on a mount point and, if so, must find that mount point and
follow the <tt>mnt-&gt;mnt_root</tt> link.  This would imply a somewhat unusual,
but certainly possible, circumstance where the starting point of the
path lookup was in part of the filesystem that was mounted on, and so
not visible from the root.</p>
<p>
The inode pointer, stored in <tt>-&gt;d_inode</tt>, is a little more
interesting.  The inode will always need to be accessed at least
twice, once to determine if it is NULL and once to verify access
permissions.  Symlink handling requires a validated inode pointer too.
Rather than revalidating on each access, a copy is made on the first
access and it is stored in the <tt>inode</tt> field of <tt>nameidata</tt> from
where it can be safely accessed without further validation.</p>
<p>
<tt>lookup_fast()</tt> is the only lookup routine that is used in RCU-mode,
<tt>lookup_slow()</tt> being too slow and requiring locks.  It is in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n1503"><tt>lookup_fast()</tt></a> that we find the important "hand over hand" tracking
of the current <tt>dentry</tt>.</p>
<p>
The current <tt>dentry</tt> and current <tt>seq</tt> number are passed to
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/dcache.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n2117"><tt>__d_lookup_rcu()</tt></a> which, on success, returns a new <tt>dentry</tt> and a new
<tt>seq</tt> number.  <tt>lookup_fast()</tt> then copies the inode pointer and
revalidates the new <tt>seq</tt> number.  It then validates the old <tt>dentry</tt>
with the old <tt>seq</tt> number one last time and only then continues.  This
process of getting the <tt>seq</tt> number of the new <tt>dentry</tt> and then
checking the <tt>seq</tt> number of the old exactly mirrors the process of
getting a counted reference to the new <tt>dentry</tt> before dropping that for
the old <tt>dentry</tt> which we saw in REF-walk.</p>
<h4>No <tt>inode-&gt;i_mutex</tt> or even <tt>rename_lock</tt></h4>
<p>
A mutex is a fairly heavyweight lock that can only be taken when it
is permissible to sleep.  As <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> forbids sleeping,
<tt>inode-&gt;i_mutex</tt> plays no role in RCU-walk.  If some other thread
does take <tt>i_mutex</tt> and modifies the directory in a way that RCU-walk
needs to notice, the result will be either that RCU-walk fails to find
the dentry that it is looking for, or it will find a dentry which
<tt>read_seqretry()</tt> won't validate.  In either case it will drop down to
REF-walk mode which can take whatever locks are needed.
<p>
Though <tt>rename_lock</tt> could be used by RCU-walk as it doesn't require
any sleeping, RCU-walk doesn't bother.  REF-walk uses <tt>rename_lock</tt>
to protect against the possibility of hash chains in the dcache changing
while they are being searched. This can result in failing to find
something that actually is there.  When RCU-walk fails to find
something in the dentry cache, whether it is really there or not, it already
drops down to REF-walk and tries again with appropriate locking.  This
neatly handles all cases, so adding extra checks on <tt>rename_lock</tt> would
bring no significant value.

<p>

<h4><tt>unlazy walk()</tt> and <tt>complete_walk()</tt></h4>
<p>
That "dropping down to REF-walk" typically involves a call to
<tt>unlazy_walk()</tt>, so named because "RCU-walk" is also sometimes
referred to as "lazy walk".
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n648"><tt>unlazy_walk()</tt></a> is called when following the path down to the current
<tt>vfsmount</tt>/<tt>dentry</tt> pair seems to have proceeded successfully, but the
next step is problematic.  This can happen if the next name cannot be
found in the dcache, if permission checking or name revalidation couldn't
be achieved while the <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> is held (which forbids
sleeping), if an automount point is found, or in a couple of cases
involving symlinks.  It is also called from <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namei.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n751"><tt>complete_walk()</tt></a> when the
lookup has reached the final component, or the very end of the path,
depending on which particular flavor of lookup is used.</p>
<p>
Other reasons for dropping out of RCU-walk that do not trigger a call
to <tt>unlazy_walk()</tt> are when some inconsistency is found that cannot be
handled immediately, such as <tt>mount_lock</tt> or one of the <tt>d_seq</tt>
seqlocks reporting a change.  In these cases the relevant function
will return <tt>-ECHILD</tt> which will percolate up until it triggers a new
attempt from the top using REF-walk.</p>
<p>
For those cases where <tt>unlazy_walk()</tt> is an option, it essentially
takes a reference on each of the pointers that it holds (<tt>vfsmount</tt>,
dentry, and possibly some symbolic links) and then verifies that the
relevant seqlocks have not been changed.  If there have been changes,
it, too, aborts with <tt>-ECHILD</tt>, otherwise the transition to REF-walk
has been a success and the lookup process continues.
<p>
Taking a reference on those pointers is not quite as simple as just
incrementing a counter.  That works to take a second reference if you
already have one (often indirectly through another object), but it
isn't sufficient if you don't actually have a counted reference at
all.
For <tt>dentry-&gt;d_lockref</tt>, it is safe to increment the reference counter
to get a reference unless it has been explicitly marked as "dead"
which involves setting the counter to <tt>-128</tt>.
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/lib/lockref.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n169"><tt>lockref_get_not_dead()</tt></a> achieves this.</p>
<p>
For <tt>mnt-&gt;mnt_count</tt> it is safe to take a reference as long as
<tt>mount_lock</tt> is then used to validate the reference.  If that
validation fails, it may <em>not</em> be safe to just drop that reference in
the standard way of calling <tt>mnt_put()</tt> — an unmount may have
progressed too far.  So the code in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/namespace.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n591"><tt>legitimize_mnt()</tt></a>, when it finds
that the reference it got might not be safe, checks the
<tt>MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT</tt> flag to determine if a simple <tt>mnt_put()</tt> is
correct, or if it should just decrement the count and pretend none of
this ever happened.</p>
<h4>Taking care in filesystems</h4>
<p>
RCU-walk depends almost entirely on cached information and often will
not call into the filesystem at all.  However there are two places,
besides the already-mentioned component-name comparison, where the file
system might be included in RCU-walk, and it must know to be
careful.</p>
<p>
If the filesystem has non-standard permission-checking requirements —
such as a networked filesystem which may need to check with the server —
the <tt>i_op-&gt;permission</tt> interface might be called during RCU-walk.  In
this case an extra "<tt>MAY_NOT_BLOCK</tt>" flag is passed so that it knows
not to sleep, but to return <tt>-ECHILD</tt> if it cannot complete promptly.
<tt>i_op-&gt;permission</tt> is given the inode pointer, not the dentry, so it
doesn't need to worry about further consistency checks.  However if it
accesses any other filesystem data structures, it must ensure they are
safe to be accessed with only the <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt> held.  This
typically means they must be freed using <tt>kfree_rcu()</tt> or similar.</p>
<p>
If the filesystem may need to revalidate dcache entries, then
<tt>d_op-&gt;d_revalidate</tt> may be called in RCU-walk too.  This interface
<em>is</em> passed the dentry but does not have access to the <tt>inode</tt> or the
<tt>seq</tt> number from the <tt>nameidata</tt>, so it needs to be extra careful when
accessing fields in the <tt>dentry</tt>.
This extra care typically involves using <tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt> or the
newer <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/624126/"><tt>READ_ONCE()</tt></a> to access fields, and verifying the result is not
NULL before using it.  This pattern can be see in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/nfs/dir.c?id=052b398a43a7de8c68c13e7fa05d6b3d16ce6801#n1100"><tt>nfs_lookup_revalidate()</tt></a>.</p>
<h4>A pair of patterns</h4>
<p>
In various places in the details of REF-walk and RCU-walk, and also in
the big picture, there are a couple of related patterns that are worth
being aware of.</p>
<p>
The first is "try quickly and check, if that fails, try slowly".  We
can see that in the high-level approach of first trying RCU-walk and
then trying REF-walk, and in places were <tt>unlazy_walk()</tt> is used to
switch to REF-walk for the rest of the path.  We also saw it last time
in <tt>dget_parent()</tt> when following a "<tt>..</tt>" link.  It tries a quick way
to get a reference, then falls back to taking locks if needed.</p>
<p>
The second pattern is "try quickly and check, if that fails, try again —
repeatedly".  This is seen with the use of <tt>rename_lock</tt> and
<tt>mount_lock</tt> in REF-walk.  RCU-walk doesn't make use of this pattern;
if anything goes wrong it is much safer to just abort and try a more
sedate approach.</p>
<p>
The emphasis here is "try quickly and check".  It should probably be
"try quickly <em>and carefully</em>, then check".  The fact that checking is
needed is a reminder that the system is dynamic and only a
limited number of things are safe at all.  The most likely cause of
errors in this whole process is assuming something is safe when in
reality it isn't.  Careful consideration of what exactly guarantees
the safety of each access is sometimes necessary.</p>
<h4>Next: symlinks</h4>
<p>
We have now covered nearly all of pathname lookup with the major
missing part being symbolic links.  The handling of symbolic links
received a major rewrite recently so it deserves a thorough
treatment.  That treatment will form the bulk of the final article in
this series which should appear in the next week or so.</p><br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

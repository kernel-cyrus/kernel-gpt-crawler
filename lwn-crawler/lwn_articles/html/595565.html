<h1>Ktap or BPF?</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 23, 2014</br>
           </div>
While the kernel's built-in tracing mechanisms have advanced considerably
over the last few years, the kernel still lacks a DTrace-style dynamic
tracing facility.  In the last year we have seen the posting of two
different approaches toward scriptable dynamic tracing: <a
href="/Articles/551314/">ktap</a> and <a href="/Articles/575531/">BPF
tracing filters</a>.  Both work by embedding a virtual machine in the
kernel to execute scripts, but the similarity ends there.  Putting one
virtual machine into the kernel for tracing is a hard sell; adding two of
them is not really seen as an option by anybody involved.  So, at some
point, a decision will have to be made.  A recent discussion on that topic
gives some hints about the direction that decision could go.
<p>
The trigger for the discussion was the posting of <a
href="/Articles/592438/">a new version of the ktap patch set</a> after a
period of silence.  While quite a bit of work has been done on ktap,
little was done to address the concerns that <a
href="/Articles/572788/">kept ktap out of the 3.13 kernel</a>.  Ingo
Molnar, who blocked the merging of ktap the last time around, <a
href="/Articles/595580/">was not pleased</a> that progress had not been
made on that front.
<p>
<h4>Virtual machines</h4>
<p>
There appear to be two specific points of argument that come up
when the merits of ktap and BPF tracing filters are discussed.  The first
of those is, naturally, the question of introducing another virtual machine
into the kernel.  On this point, the discussion has shifted a bit, though,
for a simple reason: while ktap needs its own virtual machine, the BPF
engine is already in the mainline kernel, and it has been getting better.

<p>
BPF originally stood for "Berkeley packet filter"; it was used as a way to
tell the kernel how to narrow down a stream of packets from a network
interface when tools like <tt>tcpdump</tt> are in use.  Over time, though,
BPF has been used in other contexts, such as filtering access to system
calls as part of the <a href="/Articles/475043/">seccomp mechanism</a> and
in a number of packet classification subsystems.
Alexei Starovoitov's tracing filters patch set simply allows this virtual
engine to be used to select and process system events as well.
<p>
In 2011, BPF <a href="/Articles/437981/">gained a just-in-time compiler</a>
that sped it up considerably.  The 3.15 kernel takes this work further; 
it will feature a
radically reworked (by Alexei) BPF engine that expands its functionality
considerably.  The new BPF offers the same virtual instruction set to user
space, but those instructions are translated within the kernel into a
format that is closer to what the hardware provides.  The new format offers
a number of advantages over the old, including ten registers instead of
two, 64-bit registers, more efficient jump instructions, and a mechanism to
allow kernel functions to be called from BPF programs.  Needless to say,
the additional capabilities have further reinforced BPF's position as
the virtual machine of choice for an in-kernel dynamic tracing facility.
<p>
Thus, if ktap is to be accepted into the kernel, it almost certainly needs
to be retargeted to the BPF virtual machine.  Ktap author Jovi Zhangwei <a
href="/Articles/595581/">has expressed a willingness</a> to consider making
such a change, but he sees a number of shortcomings in BPF that would need
to be resolved first.  BPF as it currently exists does not support
features needed by ktap, including access to global variables,
timer-limited looping (or loops in general, since BPF disallows them by
design), and more.  Jovi also repeatedly complained about the BPF tracing
filter design, which is oriented around attaching scripts to specific
tracepoints; Jovi wants a more flexible mechanism that would allow
attaching a single script to a range of tracepoints.
<p>
That last functionality should not be too hard to add.  Most of the rest of
Jovi's requests could probably be worked into BPF as well, especially if
Jovi were to help to do the work.  Alexei seems to be amenable to evolving
BPF in ways that would enable it to better support ktap.  The communication
between the two developers appears to be 
difficult, though, with frequent misunderstandings being seen.  At one
point, Jovi <a href="/Articles/595582/">concluded</a> that Alexei was not
interested in making the necessary changes to BPF; he responded by saying:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	Anyway, I think there will don't have any necessary to upstream
	ktap any more, I still enjoy the simplicity and flexibility given
	by ktap, and hope there will have a kernel built-in alternative
	solution in future.
</div>
<p>
In truth, the situation need not be so grim, but there may be a need for an 
outside developer to come in and actually do the work to integrate ktap and
BPF to show that it is possible.  Thus far, volunteers to do this work have
not made themselves known.   And, in any case, there is another issue.
<p>
<h4>Scripting languages</h4>
<p>
Ktap is built on the Lua language, which offers a number of features
(associative arrays, for example) that can be useful in dynamic tracing
settings.  Ingo, along with a few others, would <a
href="/Articles/595583/">rather see</a> a language that looks more
like&nbsp;C: 
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	I'd suggest using C syntax instead initially, because that's what
	the kernel is using.

	The overwhelming majority of people probing the kernel are
	programmers, so there's no point in inventing new syntax, we should
	reuse existing syntax!
</div>
<p>

The BPF tracing filters patch uses a restricted version of the C language;
Alexei has also provided backends for both GCC and LLVM to translate that
language into 
something the BPF virtual machine can run.  So, once again, the BPF approach
appears to have a bit of an advantage here at the moment.
<p>
Unsurprisingly, Jovi <a href="/Articles/595584/">feels differently</a>
about this issue; he sees the ktap language as being far simpler to work
with.  To support this claim, he provided this code from a BPF tracing filter
example:
<p>
<pre>
    void dropmon(struct bpf_context *ctx) {
        void *loc;
        uint64_t *drop_cnt;

        loc = (void *)ctx-&gt;arg2;

        drop_cnt = bpf_table_lookup(ctx, 0, &amp;loc);
        if (drop_cnt) {
            __sync_fetch_and_add(drop_cnt, 1);
        } else {
            uint64_t init = 0;
            bpf_table_update(ctx, 0, &amp;loc, &amp;init);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
This filter, he says, can be expressed this way in ktap:
<p>
<pre>
    var s ={}

    trace skb:kfree_skb {
        s[arg2] += 1
    }
</pre>
<p>

Alexei <a href="/Articles/595585/">concedes</a> that ktap has a far less
verbose source language, though he has reservations about the conciseness
of the underlying bytecode.  In any case, though, he (along with others)
has suggested that, once there is agreement on which virtual machine is to
be used, there could be any number of scripting languages supported in user
space.
<p>
And that is roughly where the discussion wound down.  There is a lot of
interesting functionality to be found in ktap, but, the way things stand
currently, it may well be that this code gets passed over in favor of an
offering from a developer who is more willing to do what is needed to get
the code upstream.  That said, this discussion is far from resolved, and
Jovi is not the only developer who is working on ktap.  With the
application of a bit of energy, it may yet be possible to get ktap's
higher-level functionality into a condition where it could someday be merged.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Loops and concision are gold. But if I had to choose, I'd say that loops are absolutely required. There might an argument to be made that loops shouldn't be allowed in the c-like BPF syntax but should be allowed in the Lua-based ktap syntax.<br>

      I think "I think there will don't have any necessary to upstream ktap any more" is more likely to mean, "I don't think it is necessary to upstream ktap any more" than to mean, "I don't think I have the will to upstream ktap anymore."
<P>
I.e. "will" is just a verb particle indicating the upstreaming is in the future and "necessary" indicates necessity.

I don't quite understand the idea to implement a lua virtual machine in the kernel.<br>
<p>
Why not create special interface for userspace for tracing/packet-filtering and then implement virtual machine completely in userspace? In this case userspace could use full featured optimizer to perform optimizations. I assume it is not a good idea to implement full featured optimizer in kernel space from security point of view.<br>
<p>
A quick googling shows that cost of context switching is less 2k cycles. So performing any non trivial action in lua in kernel is probably more expensive than switching to userspace and doing the same operation in userspace.<br>

Beyond simple context switching costs, there is also the need to pass contextual data from the probe site to the interpreter.  Some of that data may not be known declaratively (ahead of time), so the interpreter would have to run just to know what data will be needed, then the kernel would have to be consulted, then back to the interpreter, etc. etc.<br>

<font class="QuotedText">&gt; I'd suggest using C syntax instead initially, because that's what the kernel is using. The overwhelming majority of people probing the kernel are programmers, so there's no point in inventing new syntax, we should reuse existing syntax!</font><br>
<p>
Syntax is one thing, features are another.<br>
<p>
Is there an existing high-level language with C-like syntax? (Please don't answer Java)<br>

Well... I meant: *significantly* higher level than C. I don't see C++ features making much difference in this specific context. (counter-)examples?<br>

What does high-level mean? What does C-like mean?<br>
<p>
C doesn't have most of the features you want in a high-level language, such as lambda expressions, list literals, pattern matching, maybe regexes etc., so a high-level language can't possibly reuse C syntax for those (actually C99 does have array literals, but the syntax is hideous). Otoh C has features that you don't want in a high-level language, notably pointers and the silly distinction between statements and expressions, the horrid preprocessor and some operators whose usefulness is questionable at best, such as {pre,post}{in,de}crement.<br>
<p>
“High-level language with C-like syntax” is thus pretty close to an oxymoron if you ask me.<br>

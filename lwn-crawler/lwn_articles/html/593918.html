           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 9, 2014</br>
           </div>
Interprocess communication using shared memory can be easy and efficient,
but there is a catch: all of the processes involved must be able to trust
each other.  They must be able to assume that their peers will not modify
memory contents after making them available; otherwise, no end of mischief
is possible in the time between when memory contents are checked for sanity
and when they are actually used.  Similarly, processes need to trust that
their peers will not truncate the file backing up a shared memory region at
an inopportune time, causing fatal signals when they try to access parts of
the region that no longer exist.  In the real world, where this kind of
trust is often not present, careful users of shared memory must copy data
before using it and be prepared for signals; that kind of programming is
cumbersome, error-prone, and slow.  
<p>
Developers have been talking about coming up with a solution to these
problems for a bit; this discussion took the form of real code in
mid-March, when David Herrmann posted his <a href="/Articles/591108/">file
sealing patch set</a>.  The sealing concept allows one party in a
shared-memory transaction to work with a memory segment in the knowledge
that it cannot be changed by another process at an inopportune time.
<p>
A process working with the sealing API will start by creating a file on an
shmfs filesystem and mapping it into memory.  That memory region is then filled
with whatever data the process wants to pass to a another process on the
system.  When the segment is ready to be handed over, the process can seal
it with a call to <tt>fcntl()</tt> using the new <tt>SHMEM_SET_SEALS</tt>
command.  There are three types of seal that can be set on a file:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>SEAL_SHRINK</tt> prevents the file from being reduced in size.
<li> <tt>SEAL_GROW</tt> disallows file growth.
<li> <tt>SEAL_WRITE</tt> prevents all modifications except resizing.
</ul>
<P>
If all three seals are set, then the file becomes immutable.  Seals cannot
be set on a file that has writable mappings; the creating process must
remove all such mappings with <tt>munmap()</tt> before the
<tt>fcntl()</tt> call.
<p>
Once the file is sealed, the associated file descriptor can be passed to
the peer process, which can verify that the seals are in place using the
<tt>SHMEM_GET_SEALS</tt> <tt>fcntl()</tt> operation.  If the seals are
there, the recipient knows that the file (and associated shared memory
region) cannot be changed in the indicated ways.  That makes the use of
zero-copy techniques much safer, and avoids a number of other potential
issues as well.
<p>
The actual enforcement of the seals is done within the shmfs filesystem.
It is not hard to augment the calls implementing <tt>write()</tt> and
<tt>truncate()</tt> to check for the existence of a seal and fail with
<tt>EPERM</tt> should a seal exist.  Since (as mentioned above) no writable
mappings can exist when a seal is applied, all that is needed to prevent
modification through memory mappings is a check in the <tt>mmap()</tt>
implementation when a writable mapping is requested.  It appears that the
kernel can indeed credibly promise that a sealed file will not be changed
in the indicated ways.
<p>
One might argue that the potential for shared-memory mischief has just been
replaced with the potential for seal-related attacks instead.  The feature
has been developed with an eye toward preventing such attacks, though.  To
start with, only shmfs supports sealing, so there should be no issues with
hostile processes setting seals on real files.  Once the initial seals have
been set, they can only be changed by a process that has an
<i>exclusive</i> reference to the file.  So a recipient process can verify
that the seals are in place knowing that they cannot be removed as long as
it holds its own reference to the file.  So it should not be possible to
perform denial-of-service attacks by placing seals on random files, and
seals cannot be changed while another process is counting on their
protection. 
<p>
For those who do not want to mount shmfs and work with files explicitly,
there is also a new system call:
<p>
<pre>
    int memfd_create(const char *name, u64 size, u64 flags);
</pre>
<p>
This call will create a file (not visible in the filesystem) that is
suitable for sealing; it will be associated with the given <tt>name</tt>
and be <tt>size</tt> bytes in length.  The return value on success will be
a file descriptor associated with the newly created file.  The only
recognized flag is <tt>MFD_CLOEXEC</tt>, which maps to <tt>O_CLOEXEC</tt>
internally, causing the file descriptor to be automatically closed if the
process calls one of the forms of <tt>exec()</tt>.  The returned file
descriptor can be passed to <tt>mmap()</tt>, of course.
<p>
Most commenters seemed happy enough with the proposed functionality, but
there were a number of questions about the implementation and the
semantics.  Linus <a href="/Articles/593957/">didn't like the rules</a>
regarding when seals could be changed; he suggested that, instead, only the
creator of a file should be allowed to seal it.  David <a
href="/Articles/593959/">is not averse</a> to doing things that way; if
sealing were made into a one-time operation, the reference counting on
files could be eliminated entirely.  He might also add a new flag
(<tt>MFD_ALLOW_SEALING</tt>) to <tt>memfd_create()</tt> and restrict the
sealing operations to files created with that flag set.
<p>
Ted Ts'o, instead, <a href="/Articles/593963/">suggested</a> that sealing
should not be limited to shmfs files.  Instead, he would like to see
consideration given to implementing this functionality in the virtual
filesystem layer so that sealing could be used with files from any
filesystem.  David <a href="/Articles/593964/">responded</a> that he didn't
see a use case for sealing in any other context, but Ted would still like
to see a more general use for this functionality.  This part of the
conversation wound down without any resolution.
<p>
There are a number of fairly immediate use cases for the sealing
functionality in general.  Graphics drivers could use it to safely receive
buffers from applications.  The upcoming <a
href="/Articles/580194/">kdbus</a> transport can benefit from sealing.
The Android "ashmem" allocator also implements a similar feature that could
be moved over once this code gets upstream.  So the chances of this
functionality being merged into the mainline are fairly good, even though
the details of how things will work have not yet been sealed in place.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

I don't see the connection. E sealing is logically similar to public-key encryption - it allows you to give someone a value that they can't read, but which they can pass on to someone else who can. A sealed value can still be mutable, though.<br>

Could DMA from e.g. asynchronous direct I/O be used to subvert SEAL_WRITE?<br>
<p>
1) mmap() the shared memory<br>
2) open some other file with O_DIRECT<br>
3) prepare a read-type iocb pointing to the mmap()ed memory<br>
4) io_submit(), but don't wait for it to complete<br>
5) munmap() the shared memory<br>
6) SEAL_WRITE<br>
7) the "sealed" memory is overwritten by DMA from the disk drive at some point in the future when the I/O completes<br>
<p>
In this case the kernel pins the submitted pages in memory for DMA by incrementing the page reference counts when the I/O is submitted, allowing the pages to be modified by DMA even if they are no longer mapped in the address space of the process.  This is different from a regular read(), which uses the CPU to copy the data and will fail if the pages are not mapped.<br>
<p>
I am sure there are also other direct I/O mechanisms in the kernel that can be used to setup a DMA transfer to change the contents of unmapped memory; the SCSI generic driver comes to mind.<br>

Presumably the right fix is to do something along the lines of whatever COW on a MAP_ANONYMOUS page does.  I suspect that there's a reference count in struct page that's used for this, but I haven't checked.<br>

IIRC, COW marks the page read-only and then makes a copy in the trap handler when the CPU attempts a write operation.  I don't believe it is triggered by a DMA operation that had already been setup prior to marking the page read-only.<br>
<p>
I suppose SEAL_WRITE could iterate over all the pages in the file and check to make sure no page refcount is greater than the "expected" value, and return an error instead of granting the seal if a page is found with an unexpected extra reference that might have been added by e.g. get_user_pages() for direct I/O.  But looking over shmem_set_seals() in patch 2/6, it doesn't seem to do that.<br>

      Actually, in my opinion, the real bug is in step 5: <tt>munmap()</tt> should have failed when there are still pending uses of the memory area it just unmapped.
<br>
Although I doubt this is feasible&nbsp;&mdash; the pending IOs aren't marked in the VMA, and the pages might legitimately be shared by another MM (so pending IOs could be claimed to belong to this other MM).

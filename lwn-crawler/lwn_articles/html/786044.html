<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>April 16, 2019</br>
           </div>
The <a href="/Articles/786002/">5.1-rc5 announcement</a> mentioned
"<q>changes all over</q>" and highlighted a number of the areas that
had been touched.  One thing that was <i>not</i> mentioned there was the
addition of four patches fixing a security-related issue in the core
memory-management subsystem.  The vulnerability is sufficiently difficult
to exploit that almost nobody should feel the need to rush out a kernel
update, but it is still interesting to look at as a demonstration of how
things can go wrong.
<p>
One of the many things crammed into <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L31"><tt>struct
page</tt></a> is a field called <tt>_refcount</tt>; it is an
<tt>atomic_t</tt> variable that counts the number of references to the page
in question.  As an <tt>atomic_t</tt>, it's a signed, 32-bit quantity.  As
long as this count is nonzero, references to the page exist and it cannot
be reused for other purposes; once it drops to zero, the page can be
freed.
<p>
As with any counter in the kernel, <tt>_refcount</tt> should be manipulated
with care lest it overflow.  If one looks at the definition of <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/include/linux/mm.h#L968"><tt>get_page()</tt></a>,
one will see this check:
<p>
<pre>
    VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) &lt;= 0, page);
</pre>
<p>
If the reference count is incremented beyond the maximum positive value
that can be held in a 32-bit signed variable (2,147,483,647), it will wrap
around to the largest-magnitude negative value (-2,147,483,648).  That,
of course, wanders into undefined behavior, so the compiler is entitled to
set it to <tt>0xdeadbeef</tt> and erase the disk drives instead if it so
chooses.  With reasonable 
compilers and a two's complement representation, though, one can expect the
count to go negative when it overflows; that is what the above test is
checking for.
<p>
There are a couple of interesting things to note about this test.
One is that it happens <i>before</i> <tt>_refcount</tt> is incremented, so
it will only trigger on the second overflow.  That is not a problem,
though, since the system will behave as expected — even with negative
reference counts — as long as the count is not incremented all the way back
to zero.  The other thing to note is that, while
<tt>VM_BUG_ON_PAGE()</tt> will crash the kernel when the
<tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_VM</tt> configuration option is selected, it does
precisely nothing in production builds.  So, on most systems, an overflow
of the page reference count will go undetected.  That is potentially bad:
if the reference count can be incremented to the point where it
returns to zero, the page will be freed while a vast number of references
remain, and a variety of use-after-free vulnerabilities will result.
Good things do not generally ensue after an event like that.
<p>
That said, memory-management developers have had good reason to be
unworried about this eventuality.  Overflowing the reference count to zero
would require 
creating a full four-billion references to the page in question (the
negative reference counts for the second two-billion references would look
weird, but things will work as intended), and that is not an easy thing to
do.  As it turns out, according to <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6b3a70773630">this merge commit</a>,
Jann Horn has figured out how to do it, and it was indeed not easy:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	To have more than four billion references to a page requires a
	minimum of 32GB of kernel memory just for the pointers to the
	pages, much less any metadata to keep track of those pointers.
	Jann needed a total of 140GB of memory and a specially crafted
	filesystem that leaves all reads pending (in order to not ever free
	the page references and just keep adding more).
</div>
<p>
Most of us are unlikely to give such resources to an attacker, even when
asked nicely.  But a bug is a bug, and the developers who were privy to the
information about Horn's exploit decided to fix it.  The result was four
commits (from Linus Torvalds and Matthew Wilcox) making this particular
hole even harder to exploit.
<p>
The "specially crafted filesystem" mentioned above is necessary because it
is not easy for an attacker running in user space to create large numbers
of references to a given page.  Simply creating a lot of mappings using
<tt>mmap()</tt> or <tt>fork()</tt> would run into other limits long before
the reference count overflowed.  One way that does seem to work, though, is
to create large numbers of direct-I/O requests, each of which acquires a
reference while the operation is underway.  Should the filesystem be
extremely slow to finish those operations — even slower than VFAT — the
references could eventually add up to the magic number.

<p>
The first step toward preventing such exploits was to create a macro to
check whether a given reference count is getting close to going negative:
<p>
<pre>
    #define page_ref_zero_or_close_to_overflow(page) \
	    ((unsigned int) page_ref_count(page) + 127u &lt;= 127u)
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>VM_BUG_ON_PAGE()</tt> check shown above was then changed to use
this macro.  On systems where <tt>VM_BUG_ON_PAGE()</tt> does anything at
all, this new test should 
prevent reference counts from going negative, thus stopping things far
short of incrementing all the way to zero.
<p>
That said, if <tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_VM</tt> is set on a target system, an
attacker could 
still use this overflow for denial-of-service attacks.  To prevent that,
Torvalds <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/88b1a17dfc3e">created a new
<tt>try_get_page()</tt> function</a> that will refuse to acquire a
reference if the count is close to overflowing.  Then, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/8fde12ca79af"><tt>get_user_pages()</tt>
was changed</a> to use <tt>try_get_page()</tt> and to fail the entire
operation if the needed references cannot be acquired.  With those changes
in place, direct-I/O requests that threaten to overflow a reference count
will simply fail, and the attacker will be left looking for other good uses
for 140GB of free memory.  Another possible exploit, using pipes, was <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/15fab63e1e57">closed off</a> in a
similar fashion by Wilcox.
<p>
While these changes were added late in the release cycle like an urgent
fix, this clearly isn't a vulnerability that has a lot of people worried.
In fact, it was first
discussed in January on the closed kernel security list, but then the
developers involved <a 
href="/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wj7jgMOVFW0tiU-X+zhg6+Rn7mEBTej+f26rV3zXezOSA@mail.gmail.com/">simply forgot
about it</a> for a while.  That lapse has now been rectified, which is a good
thing; one never knows when somebody might discover an easier way to force
the page reference count to overflow.  When that happens, the patches
merged for 5.1-rc5 should be able to prevent a severe compromise of the
system.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

Was there a reason this wasn't just changed to refcount_t, which cannot overflow (once it gets too big, it stays there) ???<br>

And if refcount_t isn't suitable here, is it suitable anywhere?<br>

Doesn't a reference count that gets stuck to its highest value cause the page to be never freed?<br>
Allowing it to be decremented from the saturated value would also be dangerous, because the page might get then freed prematurely.<br>
It seems to me a reference count overflow simply must be handled as an error, otherwise you introduce rare bugs.<br>

I agree with you, but I don't know how the "getting stuck" is handled, perhaps it triggers some special handling to free the resource.<br>

      Once a <tt>refcount_t</tt> value hits its max, it will no longer be changed — it gets "stuck".  Any resource controlled by that count will then never be freed.  A resource leak is considered to be less threatening than a premature free.  More information in <a href="/Articles/693038/">this article</a> and <a href="/Articles/706498/">this one</a>.

This is pretty much correct. Consider somebody using this attack against a page of libc (using it as the source for an O_DIRECT write). If we want to be able to fork() in the future, we need to have _those_ refcount increments succeed while further attempts to do O_DIRECT I/Os fail.<br>
<p>
And that's what this patch does. Once the refcount reaches 2^31, "safe" increments are still allowed but "potentially exploitable" ones fail.<br>

That's right. There are now essentially four ranges for the page refcount -- 0 (unreferenced), up to 2^31 (normal), 2^31 to 2^32-127 (heavily used) and -127 to -1 (underflow)<br>

The macro is misnamed, I now realise.<br>

<p>
I think it's a question of tradeoffs (as so much of programming is). Getting an object that uses a refcount_t always succeeds. It may have the side-effect of making the object indestructible, but there's no new rarely-executed, security-critical code-path to test.<br>
<p>
get_user_pages() can already fail, so all users should be prepared for that. If not, they're currently a security hole -- consider one thread which calls munmap() on addresses that another thread is passing to a syscall.<br>
<p>
refcount_t isn't the appropriate fix for this problem, but is generally a better approach than a silently overflowing / wrapping atomic_t<br>

I was wondering the same.  This change feels almost against the principal of improving existing mechanisms rather than adding new ones.<br>
<p>
But then I looked up the refcount_t overflow protection and noted it was first designed by PaXTeam with work to mainline it being done by Kees along with impressive benchmarking results.<br>
<p>
The reputation of PaXTeam needs no comment, though I admit an unhealthy amount of admiration for Kees for continuing excellent work in the face of past fierce and unkind put downs from the Linux project leader in chief and friction elsewhere.<br>
<p>
While we now have 'nice Linus', he himself had a hand in this patch set, so perhaps the reason for not using or adapting refcount_t is one of personal politics rather than technical merit.<br>
<p>
I may well be blind to something here (and certainly I'm not close enough to this sub-system) but personally I just don't buy that refcount_t couldn't be used here, or slightly improved for use.  The refcount_t saturating behaviour sounds right, as does producing a call stack on first saturation of the counter and then never decrementing the count again.  Killing the calling process on first saturation of a count may not be suitable in case a call originates from a kernel thread itself, but I'm sure that could be adapted if needed (or not already) - with possible benefits and uses in other parts of the kernel too.<br>
<p>
Hopefully a later comment will clearly explain the technical limitation of refcount_t which could only be overcome by adding a new esoteric mechanism.<br>

For the record, the original idea of using the negative reference count in this way was mine. I didn't consider switching to refcount_t for a second, not because I have a long-standing problem with Spender, but because it would be a ridiculous amount of change for a fix. And as my earlier comment said, it would have had significant downsides.<br>

If you are going to tell me where I should write, may I respectfully suggest that as a leading linux kernel developer, perhaps you should read the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/765108/">CoC</a> and at least choose a more respectful tone in your replies.  This isn't the lkml and serves a more diverse audience.  It's reasonable to expect different levels of understanding here.

<P>
Having read and re-read the article and comments, that seems to be the crux of the argument for making a new mechanism.  Apart from "refcount_t isn't the appropriate fix for this problem", I don't see where any critical technical limitation of refcount_t is stated.</p>
<P>Short-cutting the work to make this change might have been the best option here, but it's surely creating technical debt.  For a "vulnerability [that] is sufficiently difficult to exploit that almost nobody should feel the need to rush out a kernel update", I hope it is worth it.</p>

Of course, he didn't speak on behalf of LWN -- but he didn't claim to do so, too.<br>
<p>
He spoke on behalf of us long-time LWN readers who don't want to see ad-hominem attacks or comments with random assumptions expressing negative connotations on a personal level, why kernel developers did implement a change in a certain way besides them explaining explicitly why it was done this way here in this LWN thread.<br>

Why not just panic if a page's refcount &lt; -1?<br>
<p>
(I'm assuming &lt;-1 and not ≤-1 based on Willy's comment)<br>
<p>
As Willy pointed out earlier, this change makes the refcount have four ranges instead of two (or one, depending on how you count.) That seems like a lot of added complexity (hidden behind a macro) to accommodate a use case... actually, can anyone suggest when it would be useful to have 2^32 or more references to a page? I can't think of a good use case, but what do I know? :-)<br>
<p>
(Also, who's Willy?)<br>
<p>
Regardless, congratulations and thank you to all the developers who identified and fixed this before it became more than a theoretical problem.<br>

It's generally considered unfriendly to panic ... we tend to prefer BUG_ON() which just kills the task.<br>
<p>
<font class="QuotedText">&gt; can anyone suggest when it would be useful to have 2^32 or more references to a page?</font><br>
<p>
I don't think it's ever useful to have 2^32 actual references to a page. The four ranges are really there to help the system behave well in the presence of an attack.<br>
<p>
That said, with huge pages, we often increment refcounts by the number of base pages in the huge page. If we supported 1GB THPs, that would be 2^18 references per task. So with 2^14 tasks mapping the same page, we'd overflow in an entirely legitimate manner. Fortunately, we only support 2MB THPs today, so this doesn't yet apply. (hugetlbfs handles refcounts differently from THP)<br>

I'm not sure I understand it. The only real fix I see here is to convert all users of get_page() to try_get_page(). What is the new macro for? If BUG_ON does not crash your kernel, then nothing changes. If it does, it simply lifts the limit from one astronomical value to another.<br>

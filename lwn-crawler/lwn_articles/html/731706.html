<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>August 23, 2017</br>
           </div>
The persistent-memory arrays we're told we'll all be able to get someday
promise high-speed, byte-addressable storage in massive quantities.  The
Linux kernel community has been working to support this
technology fully for a few years now, but there is one problem lacking a proper
solution: allowing direct writes to persistent memory that is managed by a
filesystem.  None of the proposed solutions have yet made
it into the mainline, but that hasn't stopped developers from trying; now
two new patch sets addressing this issue are under consideration.
<p>
Normally, filesystems are in control of all I/O to the underlying storage
media; they use that control to ensure that the filesystem structure is
consistent at all times.  Even when a file on a traditional storage device
is mapped into a process's virtual address space, the filesystem manages
the writeback of modified pages from the page cache to persistent storage.
Directly mapped 
persistent memory bypasses the filesystem, though, leading to a number of
potential problems including inconsistent metadata or data corruption and
loss if the filesystem relocates the file being modified.  Solving this
problem requires getting the filesystem back into the loop just far enough
to avoid confusion while keeping the performance enabled by direct access
to the storage media.
<p>
Proposed solutions have included a special <a href="/Articles/678011/">"I
know what I'm doing" flag</a> and, more recently, <a
href="/Articles/726481/">a new system call named <tt>daxctl()</tt></a> to
freeze the state of a 
file's metadata so that the data could be safely modified in place.
None of them have proved fully satisfactory, though, sending developers
back to their keyboards to come up with a new approach.
<p>
<h4>Synchronous page faults</h4>
<p>
One new contender is the <a href="/Articles/731588/">synchronous page
faults patch set</a> from Jan Kara.  It follows the lead of some of the
previous attempts by ensuring that any needed filesystem metadata writes
are completed before a process is allowed to modify directly mapped data.
A new flag, <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt>, is added to the <tt>mmap()</tt> system call
to request the synchronous behavior; that means, in particular:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	The guarantee provided by this flag is: While a block is writeably
	mapped into page tables of this mapping, it is guaranteed to be
	visible in the file at that offset also after a crash.
</div>
<p>
In other words, the filesystem will not silently relocate the block, and it
will ensure that the file's metadata is in a consistent state so that the
blocks in question will be present after a crash.  This is
done by ensuring 
that any needed metadata writes have been done before the process is
allowed to write pages affected by that metadata.
<p>
When a persistent-memory region is mapped using <tt>MAP_SYNC</tt>, the
memory-management code will check to see whether there are metadata writes
pending for the affected file.  It will not actually flush those writes
out, though.  Instead, the pages are mapped read-only with a special flag,
forcing a page fault when the process first attempts to perform a write to
one of those pages.  The fault handler will then flush out any dirty
metadata synchronously, set the page permissions to allow the write, and
return.  At that point, the process can write the page safely, since
all the necessary metadata changes have already made it to persistent
storage.
<p>
The result is a relatively simple mechanism that will perform far better
than the currently available alternative â€” manually calling
<tt>fsync()</tt> before each write to persistent memory.  The potential
downside is that any write operation can now create a flurry of I/O as the
filesystem flushes out dirty metadata.  That can cause the process to block
in what was supposed to be a simple memory write, introducing latency that
may be unexpected and unwanted.  Fear of that latency has helped to drive
the quest for alternatives.
<p>
<h4>MAP_DIRECT</h4>
<p>
One such alternative is the <a href="/Articles/730991/"><tt>MAP_DIRECT</tt>
patch set</a> from Dan Williams.  It can be thought of as the current form
of the <tt>daxctl()</tt> patch mentioned above, though that new system call
is no longer a part of the proposal.  Instead, we have, once again, a new
<tt>mmap()</tt> flag, but the proposed semantics are
rather different.  This flag eliminates the potential for write-fault
latency by "sealing" the state of the file at the time it is mapped.
<p>
When a filesystem sees a map request with <tt>MAP_DIRECT</tt>, it should
ensure that all metadata related to the area being mapped is consistent on
the storage media before
continuing.  Once the mapping has been made, the filesystem must reject any
operation that would force a metadata write affecting the portion of the
file that has been mapped.  Blocks cannot be moved, for example, unless the
filesystem can magically perform the move in an atomic manner that does not
risk data loss for a concurrent process writing to that block.  Operations
like truncating the file, breaking the sharing of extents in the file, or
allocating blocks will fail.  This extends to allocating blocks for the
region that has been mapped; the application must thus ensure that all of
the relevant blocks are allocated before creating the mapping.
<p>
An important aspect of this "sealing" operation is that it is a part of the
filesystem's runtime state; it is not stored on the media itself.  So, if
the system crashes, the file will not be sealed after the reboot.  The seal
is only there to support a specific mapping and will go away when the
mapping itself is taken down.  It's also worth noting that the filesystem
implementation may choose to only seal the portion of the file that has
been mapped, or it may seal the entire file.
<p>
An application that uses <tt>MAP_DIRECT</tt> will want a clear indication
from the kernel that the file has indeed been sealed.  Unfortunately,
<tt>mmap()</tt> is one of those system calls that does not check for
unknown flags; one can pass <tt>MAP_DIRECT</tt> on any existing kernel and
not get an error back.  To get around this problem, the patch set adds a
new <tt>mmap3()</tt> variant that <i>does</i> fail on unknown flags.
Internally, the patch set adds a <tt>mmap_supported_mask</tt> field to the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure so that each low-level implementation
can specify which flags it is able to handle.  Requiring applications to
use a new version of <tt>mmap()</tt> is not pretty, but there is no other
way to solve the problem without an ABI change.
<p>
Use of <tt>MAP_DIRECT</tt> requires the <tt>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</tt>
capability; without that restriction, it was feared, it might be possible
to carry out a denial-of-service attack by sealing a file that some other
process needs to be able to change.  As a result, this feature is not
available to most users, which rather limits its usefulness.  In an attempt
to improve the situation, the patch set also adds a new <tt>fcntl()</tt>
operation called <tt>F_MAP_DIRECT</tt>.  This operation, which is also
subject to the capability check, sets a flag on an open file that causes
subsequent <tt>mmap()</tt> operations to act as if <tt>MAP_DIRECT</tt> had
been specified, but without the capability check.  The idea is that a
privileged process could open a file and set this flag, then pass the file
descriptor to an unprivileged process that does the actual work with that
file.
<p>
One advantage to <tt>MAP_DIRECT</tt> is that it has applications beyond
just allowing high-performance applications to write directly to storage.
The sealing mechanism is close to what the kernel needs anyway for files
used for swapping, so some improvements may be possible there.  It also
makes it possible to set up DMA I/O operations from user-space drivers, a
feature that is attractive in the RDMA realm, at least.
<p>
Comments on both patch sets have been relatively muted after the most
recent posting.  Each is probably getting close to a point where it could
be considered for inclusion.  What has not happened, though, is any sort of
discussion on which of the two is the better approach, or whether they
should be combined somehow.  So, while the community may be getting closer
to a solution for direct writes to persistent memory, it will probably be a
little while yet before any solution makes it upstream.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

If you are willing to add an fcntl, it doesn't seem like you need mmap3.  An fcntl can tell the kernel to interpret mmap flags in the desired manner on that fd, which seems like a good idea independently of any persistent- memory goals.<br>
<p>
Rather than restricting use with a capability, I think I would rather see the ability to designate a snapshot of a file as modifiable by memory writes, while the file proper remains modifiable by other programs.<br>
<p>
In 1988, IBM introduced the AS400, which emulated a persistent-memory programming model. (It is still sold as a VM to run on POWER hardware. Programs written to it routinely outlive the hardware they were started on.)  People with experience programming for that environment may have useful insights into how to best use persistent RAM.<br>

I'm confused, how then do you merge the snapshot and the regular file if conflicting changes are made?  This seems fraught.  Also, not all filesystems support snapshots.<br>
<p>
As does the MAP_DIRECT idea.  Perhaps the required complexity could be hidden in a library...?  But as it stands, that seems like a lot of careful work for an application to have to do to use this feature.<br>
<p>
It does seem they could coexist, though Ã  best of both worlds with the ease of option 1 and the latency guarantee of 2 would be ideal.  Though perhaps impossible :p<br>

In normal use, there would be no need to merge the snapshot and the regular file, because in practice no one would change the latter, and the snapshot could simply replace it.  If the regular file were written on, the snapshot version is just another file, and you deal with conflicts the same way as other cases where there are two modified copies of a file -- choose one, choose the other, diff and resolve conflicts -- it's not the kernel's business, they're just files.<br>

... and about snapshot support: I think we can assume that persistent RAM would be managed by a new file system designed to match its characteristics, and that file system can be assumed to provide snapshots.  As an extravagant alternative, the kernel VFS might be improved to support snapshots on all file systems.<br>

Not only do they outlive the hardware, the AS400's operating system was designed for programs outliving the hardware! The binaries were basically the compiler's intermediate representation, and the machine compiled them into a cache when they first ran. The same programs could thus be installed both on the old 48-bit CISC architecture (*) or on newer POWER-based systems.<br>

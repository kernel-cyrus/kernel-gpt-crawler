<h1>LFCS: Building the kernel with Clang</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="FeatureByline">
           By <b>Jake Edge</b><br>May 4, 2011</br>
           </div>
<p>
Back in October, Bryce Lelbach <a
href="/Articles/411654/rss">announced</a> that he (and others) had built
a working Linux kernel using (mostly) Clang, the LLVM-based C compiler. At
the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit (LFCS) back in April, Lelbach
gave a talk about the progress that had been made, and the work still to be
done, for the <a href="https://github.com/lll-project">LLVM Linux (LLL)
project</a>.  That talk, along with the rest of the LLVM track, was quite
interesting, and once again showed that having two (or more) "competing"
projects is generally beneficial to both. 
</p>

<h4>Why build Linux with Clang?</h4>

<p>
Lelbach started off describing the reasons behind the decision to try to
build Linux with Clang, most of which centered around the diagnostics that
the compiler produces. The Clang static analyzer has the ability to show
"<q>what the compiler sees when it's looking at your code</q>", he
said. He thought that a huge codebase like Linux could benefit from that
kind of analysis. 
</p>

<p>
In fact, the Clang diagnostics were quite useful when he was building the
Broadcom wireless driver for his MacBook, he said.  Clang doesn't forget
things, so it can show macros before their expansion, typedefs, and so on.
It also shows the line in the source code with a caret pointing to the
offending code, along with "fixit hints".  Those hints can be automatically
applied to the source code to fix the problem in question.

</blockquote>
<p>
The project got a 2.6.36-based kernel running back in October, and now has
working kernels based on .37 and .38. Neither Xen nor KVM worked at the
time of the talk and Xen won't even compile, though KVM
is said to work now.  More than 90% of the drivers in the kernel will at
least compile, and many will work.  Some out-of-tree binary drivers (Broadcom, NVIDIA) will
work as well. SMP versions of the kernel for both 32 and 64-bit x86
platforms are now working, though some of the code needs to be patched in
order to build correctly.
</p>

<h4>Things that don't work</h4>

<p>
The integrated assembler (IA) for Clang does not have support for
generating "real
mode" code using <tt>.code16gcc</tt> directives, so the Linux boot code cannot
be built using IA.  There is a "<q>nasty pile</q>" of real mode code
required to boot on x86, Lelbach said. IA is the default for recent
versions of Clang, but using the 
GNU Assembler (gas) was required for the boot code.  Adding support for an
LLVM x86-16 backend is the right approach, he said, and LLVM project
members in the audience agreed that it was something that could be added to
IA. 
</p>

<p>
The "<q>vast majority of GCC extensions are supported</q>" by Clang,
even those which are not documented, which makes compiling the kernel much
easier. Things like inline assembly, the <tt>__attribute__</tt> and
<tt>__builtin__</tt> syntax, and so on, all just work.  He expected that
there might be problems with inline assembly, but that has not proven to be
the case.  Clang defaults to the C99 standard, though, so the
<tt>gnu89</tt> standard needs to be specified to build the kernel.
</p>

<p>
There are some GCC extensions that aren't implemented, however, including
explicit register variables. That lack blocks Xen and some user-space
libraries (like glibc) from compiling.  There
are also some "<q>intentionally unsupported extensions</q>",
including local/nested functions, which is only used in a Thinkpad driver.
A bigger problem is that Clang lacks support for variable-length arrays in
structures (VLAIS). A declaration like:
<pre>
    void f (int i) {
        struct foo_t {
            char a[i];
        } foo;
    }
</pre>
cannot be compiled in Clang, though declarations like:
<pre>
    void f (int i) {
        char foo[i];
    }
</pre>
are perfectly acceptable.  Code like the former is used in the iptables
code, the 
kernel hashing (HMAC) routines, and some drivers.  Those parts have to be
<a
href="https://github.com/lll-project/kernel/commit/d828bfdcbaf01d4a0abae5642c42c969b7ceb980">patched</a>
in order to be built, he said.  
Once again, someone from the audience piped up to say that support for
VLAIS could be added as long as the patches were not "<q>wildly
invasive</q>".  The LLL folks "<q>prefer adding things to Clang
rather than patching the kernel</q>", Lelbach said.
</p>

<p>
That led to a question about whether the project was pushing any of its
patches upstream to the kernel.  Lelbach said that the PaX team (who is
another LLL developer) had
submitted a few, but that those were rejected; "<q>after three, we
stopped</q>" submitting them.  Part of the problem is that the patches
are not ready for inclusion because there is a lack developer time to get
them into shape.  As an audience member noted, though, the kernel folks are
quick 
to take any patches that fix bugs found by Clang.
</p>

<h4>Code generation and optimization problems</h4>

<p>
There are several code generation and optimization options for GCC that
aren't supported by Clang. One of those is <tt>-mregparm</tt> that governs
the number of registers used to pass integer arguments.  That means
calls to functions like <tt>memcpy()</tt> are generated that ignore the custom
calling conventions.
<p>
 Also,
<tt>-fcall-saved-reg</tt> is not supported by Clang and that affects the
uses of the <tt>ALTERNATIVE()</tt> macro in the kernel, which chooses
between assembly instructions depending on the processor model. For some of the
<tt>__arch_hweight*()</tt> implementations <tt>ALTERNATIVE()</tt> buries
the actual function 
call inside 
assembly code, so Clang doesn't know about it.  That means that the
generated code is not saving all of the registers that it needs to, so
 uses
of <tt>ALTERNATIVE()</tt> are commented out and a normal call to the
function is used instead.
</p>

<p>
Another problem is with <tt>-pg</tt>, which enables instrumentation code
for function calls in GCC, and is used when building Ftrace.  For inline
functions, the calls to <tt>mcount()</tt> get added multiple times, both
when the code is generated and when it is expanded inline.  The
<tt>no_instrument_function</tt> attribute is not properly propagated to inline
functions, he said.

<p>
The final
problem that Lelbach mentioned is the <tt>-fno-optimize-sibling-calls</tt>
flag that is not supported by Clang.  The flag disables tail call
elimination, and the kernel introspection code (like Ftrace) assumes
specific stack 
depths in various places.  Because Clang doesn't support the flag,
code which walks the call stack can end up dereferencing user-space
pointers, which 
leads to runtime crashes.  This was worked around by defining
<tt>HAVE_ARCH_CALLER_ADDR</tt> for x86 and defining
<tt>CALLER_ADDR[1-6]</tt> as dummy values, effectively disabling the stack
backtracing. 
</p>

<p>
It is not just Lelbach who is working LLL, and he noted that the PaX team,
Alp Toker, and T&ouml;r&ouml;k Edwin have all contributed, along with various
Clang/LLVM and Linux 
kernel hackers.  There are plans to create a mailing list for the project
and the beginnings of a <a
href="https://github.com/lll-project/kernel/wiki/">wiki</a> are taking
shape.  Overall, it's an interesting project that will likely end up
helping to find bugs in the kernel while discovering features that could or
should be supported by LLVM/Clang.

      Here's a heads up on -pg -mfentry. The -mfentry on top of -pg uses a different mechanism other than mcount. It adds a call to __fentry__ instead of mcount, and uses this at the beginning of the function:
<p>
<pre>
000000000000009e &lt;atomic_long_add&gt;:
      9e:       e8 00 00 00 00          callq  a3 &lt;atomic_long_add+0x5&gt;
                        9f: R_X86_64_PC32       __fentry__-0x4
      a3:       55                      push   %rbp
      a4:       48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
</pre>
<p>
Instead of:
<p>
<pre>
00000000000000c4 &lt;atomic_long_add&gt;:
      c4:       55                      push   %rbp
      c5:       48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
      c8:       e8 00 00 00 00          callq  cd &lt;atomic_long_add+0x9&gt;
                        c9: R_X86_64_PC32       mcount-0x4
      cd:       f0 48 01 3e             lock add %rdi,(%rsi)
</pre>
<p>
It is currently only supported in gcc 4.6.0 and higher on x86, and not on the other platforms (that I know of). I will be converting Ftrace to use this when available which will also add a lot more features to function tracing.

<p>
This is just forward looking, but if LLVM is to be a competitor of gcc, it will definitely need to support this.

If I read this correctly, the only real difference is that the __fentry__ call happens before pushing %rbp and establishing a stack frame, whereas with mcount, it's a true nested call.<br>
<p>
Aside from a shorter stack depth and a different label, could you expand on what the advantages are?  You mention that it will allow you to add a lot more features to Ftrace.  (A link is fine if you have one handy.)<br>

The first main benefit of this, is that you no longer need to have stack frames enabled. The -pg option with mcount requires stack frames. With -pg and -mfentry, you no longer have to have stack frames, which gives a bit of a performance boost.<br>
<p>
The next part is that the callbacks to the function tracer can now get access to the registers. Because the stack frame is set up before mcount is called, you lose out on having the stack and registers holding function parameters by the time mcount is called. With the fentry right at the beginning of the function, you now have full access to the registers and stack frame as it was given to the function, which means we now have the possibility of tracing the data in the function parameters as well.<br>
<p>
The third part and the most extreme, is that because fentry is called as the very first instruction of the function, we could possibly now "hijack" the function completely!  That is, we could call a different function and return to the original caller without any issue. I could imagine crazy things with this feature.<br>
<p>
Perhaps taking point 2 and 3 above, instead of a full hijack, we could also have the ability to modify the parameters. Not sure what usefulness that is besides rootkits and academia. But who knows?<br>
<p>
As for a link for documentation of what ftrace could do with this? Sorry, but I don't know of the url that points into my head ;)<br>

Ah, ok.  I guess the advantages weren't immediately obvious with the example you posted, in part because the __fentry__ version still had a stack frame, and the stack frame in both cases wasn't terribly exciting.<br>
<p>
With a beefier function and beefier stack frame, the differences would become more noticeable.  And if you compile with -fomit-frame-pointer in the __fentry__ version, I can see the differences growing further still, as you note.<br>
<p>
In the atomic_add example, it wasn't obvious that mcount wouldn't let you do the things you say you might want to do with __fentry__. Your explanation makes the limitations of mcount clearer.<br>

I guess the references to Xen in the article refer to the Linux kernel's CONFIG_XEN option?<br>

Patches were applied to the Xen hypervisor xen-unstable.hg tree quite recently which allow it to build with a recent Clang snapshot.<br>

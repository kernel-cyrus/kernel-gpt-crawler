           <p>January 3, 2013</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz</p>
           </div>
Last November, LWN described <a
href="/Articles/524742/">the vmpressure_fd() work</a> which
implemented a new system call making it possible for user-space
applications to be 
informed when system memory is tight.  Those applications could then
respond by freeing memory, easing the crunch.  That patch set has since
evolved considerably.
<p>
Based on the feedback that author Anton Vorontsov received, the concept has
changed from  a new system call to <a
href="/Articles/528687/">a new, control-group-based subsystem</a>.
The controller implementation allows for integration with the memory
controller, meaning that applications can receive notifications when their
specific control group is running low on memory, even if the system as a
whole is not under memory pressure.
<p>
As with previous versions of the patch, applications can receive
notifications for three levels of memory pressure: "low" (memory reclaim is
happening at a low level), "medium" (some swapping is happening), and "oom"
(memory pressure is severe).  But these notifications may no longer be the
primary way in which applications interact with the controller, thanks to 
the most significant change in comparison to the previous
<tt>vmpressure_fd()</tt> solution: 
the addition of a
user-space "shrinker"
interface allowing the kernel to ask user space to 
free specific amounts of memory when needed.  This API was inspired by Andrew
Morton's <a href="/Articles/531138/">feedback</a>
on the first revision of the mempressure control group subsystem patch:
<p>
<div class="BigQuote">
	It blurs the question of "who is in control".  We tell userspace
	"hey, we're getting a bit tight here, please do something".  And
	userspace makes the decision about what "something" is.  So
	userspace is in control of part of the reclaim function and the
	kernel is in control of another part.  Strange interactions are
	likely.
</div>
<p>
Andrew also worried that application developers may tune their programs
against a particular kernel version; subtle behavioral changes in new
kernel releases might then cause regressions.  In short, Andrew complained,
the behavior of the system as a whole was not testable, so there would be
no way to know if subsequent kernel changes made performance worse.
<p>
Andrew's suggestion was to give more control to the kernel and introduce some
kind of interface for user-space memory scanning and freeing (similar in
its main concept to the <tt>shrink_slab()</tt> kernel shrinkers). This
interface would control user-space reclaim behavior; if something goes
wrong, it will be up to kernel to resolve the issue. It would also give
kernel developers the ability to test and tune whole system behavior by
writing a compliant user-space test application and running it.
<p>

The user-space shrinker implementation by Anton operates on the concept of
chunks of an application-defined size. There is an assumption that the
application 
does memory allocations with a specific granularity (the "chunk size,"
which may be not 100% accurate but the more accurate it is, the better).
So if the application caches data in chunks of 1MB, that is the size it
will provide to the shrinker interface.  That is done through a sequence
like this:

<p>
<ol>

<li> The application opens the control interface, which is found as the
     file <tt>cgroup.event_control</tt> in the controller directory.
<p>
<li> The shrinker interface 
     (<tt>mempressure.shrinker</tt> in the controller directory) must also
     be opened.
<p>
<li> The <tt>eventfd()</tt> system call is used to obtain a third file
     descriptor for notifications.
<p>
<li> The application then writes a string containing the <tt>eventfd()</tt>
     file descriptor number, the <tt>mempressure.shrinker</tt> file
     descriptor number, and the chunk size to the control interface.
</ol>
<p>

Occasionally, the application should write a string to the shrinker file
indicating how many chunks have been allocated or (using a negative count)
freed.  The kernel uses this information to maintain an internal count of
how many reclaimable chunks the application is currently holding on to.
<p>

If the kernel wants the application to free some memory, the notification
will come through the <tt>eventfd()</tt> file descriptor in the form of an
integer count of the number of chunks that should be freed.  The kernel
assumes that the application will free the specified number of chunks before
reading from the <tt>eventfd()</tt> file descriptor again. If the
application isn't able to reclaim all chunks for some reason, it
should re-add the number of chunks that were not freed by writing to
the <tt>mempressure.shrinker</tt> file.
<p>

The patchset also includes <a href="/Articles/531140/">an example
application</a> (slightly buggy in the current version) for testing the new
interface.  It creates two threads; the first thread initializes the
user-space shrinker mechanism notifications and then tries to allocate
memory (more than physically available) in an infinite loop. The second
thread listens for user-space shrinker notifications and frees the requested
number of chunks (also in an infinite loop).  Ideally, during the run of the
test application the system shouldn't get into an out-of-memory condition
and it also shouldn't use much swap space (if any is available of
course).
<p>

Various comments were received on the patch set, so at least one more round
of changes will be required before this interface can be considered for
merging into the mainline.  There is also an open question on how this
feature interacts with <a href="/Articles/522135/">volatile ranges</a> and
whether both mechanisms (neither of which has yet been merged) are truly
required.  So this discussion may 
continue well into the new year before we end up with reclaimable
user-space memory caches in their final form.<br clear="all"><table class="IndexEntries">

This is a potential route to remove the need for predetermined heap sizes in the JVM and other GC based systems.  The low memory message for the control group would be an appropriate time to trigger a full compacting GC rather than once heap hits some arbitrary per process limit.<br>

Yes, and hopefully it could be used to make application with GCs much better "good citizens" on a shared computer, see "Garbage Collection Without Paging" (their Linux patch was rejected)<br>

If there's only single process in the group, it probably can have pretty good guess about its real memory usage and how much it can free memory, even when overcommit is enabled.  But using groups to manage a single process (the process itself), seems a bit weird.<br>
<p>
If controller is managing a group that contains also other processes, how often that kind of controller really knows how much memory the other processes use (in general that requires parsing SMAPS data from /proc/)?<br>
<p>
I mean, if you need kernel to tell when the group uses more memory than controller has told the kernel it can use, and that comes as "surprise" to the controller, how it knows what it can do with the processes it's managing to free amount that approximates what kernel indicates to be needed?<br>
<p>
To me it seems that at best it can request other processes to free memory and hope for the best...  And if situation doesn't resolve, it of course can kill them.<br>

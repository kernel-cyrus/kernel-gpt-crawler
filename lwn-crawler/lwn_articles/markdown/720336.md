Linus Torvalds recently [let it be known](/Articles/720207/) that the 4.11-rc7 kernel prepatch had a good chance of being the last for this development series. So the time has come to look at this development cycle and the contributors who made it happen. 

As of this writing, 12,546 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline repository for 4.11, making this cycle more-or-less average for recent kernels. Those changesets were contributed by 1,723 developers and grew the kernel by nearly 300,000 lines. Note that the current record for the most developers participating is 1,729 for 4.9; if another half-dozen developers put in a fix for 4.11, that record could yet fall. Of the developers contributing to 4.11, 278 made their first contribution ever in this cycle. 

The most active developers in the 4.11 cycle were:

In the "by changesets" column, Chris Wilson ended up on top with a body of work mostly focused on the Intel i915 driver. Arnd Bergmann continues to apply fixes all over the tree, Ingo Molnar (primarily) contributed a massive reworking of the `sched.h` header file, Christoph Hellwig did significant work all over the block I/O subsystem, and Takashi Iwai added many patches as part of his role as maintainer of the audio subsystem. 

In the "by changed lines" column, James Smart did a lot of work on the lpfc SCSI driver. Ard Biesheuvel's work was mostly in optimized crypto algorithms for the ARM architecture, Selvin Xavier contributed three patches adding the "bnxt_re" RDMA-over-converged-Ethernet driver, Greg Kroah-Hartman deleted some unwanted staging code, and David VomLehn added the AQtion network driver. 

The developers contributing to 4.11 were supported by at least 225 employers, the most active of which were:

This table has gotten pretty boring over the years; it tends not to change much from one cycle to the next. 

Developing code is important, but so are reviewing, testing, and reporting bugs. The kernel process has long had the mechanisms to track these contributions, though they are not as heavily used as they could be. The `Reviewed-by` tag records a reviewer's contribution explicitly; the reviewers most credited in this way in 4.11 were: 

> Top reviewers in 4.11  
> ---  
> Hannes Reinecke| 126  
> Joonas Lahtinen| 125  
> Alex Deucher| 106  
> Christoph Hellwig| 106  
> Chris Wilson| 92  
> Johannes Thumshirn| 77  
> Geert Uytterhoeven| 68  
> Andreas Dilger| 68  
> Christian König| 63  
> Tvrtko Ursulin| 60  
> Daniel Vetter| 57  
> Tomas Henzl| 56  
> Andy Shevchenko| 55  
> Laurent Pinchart| 50  
> Oleg Drokin| 50  
> Doug Oucharek| 46  
> Linus Walleij| 45  
> Liu Bo| 42  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman| 38  
> Darrick J. Wong| 38  
> Chao Yu| 38  
> Josh Triplett| 37  
  
Hannes Reinecke's review work was focused on the SCSI subsystem, while Joonas Lahtinen reviewed i915 patches. Each of them managed to review 1% of the total patch flow going into the 4.11 kernel — two patches per day for (what will probably be) a 63-day development cycle. 

Of the 12,546 changesets merged for 4.11, 3,099 contained `Reviewed-by` tags. Needless to say, those tags do not document all of the review work that happened during this development cycle. Much review activity does not result in the addition of a tag of any type. When patches are reviewed by the subsystem maintainer that ultimately applies them, the result is usually a `Signed-off-by` tag instead. If one looks at those tags when applied by developers who were not the author of the patch, the result is this: 

> Top non-author signoffs in 4.11  
> ---  
> David S. Miller| 1473| 12.4%  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman| 961| 8.1%  
> Andrew Morton| 408| 3.4%  
> Mark Brown| 313| 2.6%  
> Martin K. Petersen| 308| 2.6%  
> Ingo Molnar| 272| 2.3%  
> Kalle Valo| 241| 2.0%  
> Mauro Carvalho Chehab| 231| 1.9%  
> Doug Ledford| 207| 1.7%  
> Jens Axboe| 203| 1.7%  
> Michael Ellerman| 187| 1.6%  
> Linus Walleij| 172| 1.4%  
> Herbert Xu| 166| 1.4%  
> Alex Deucher| 164| 1.4%  
> Daniel Vetter| 152| 1.3%  
> Jonathan Cameron| 129| 1.1%  
> Rafael J. Wysocki| 129| 1.1%  
> David Sterba| 127| 1.1%  
> Ralf Baechle| 126| 1.1%  
> Ulf Hansson| 124| 1.0%  
  
Here, it is hard to separate review activity from the overall level of activity in the relevant subsystems. But a rough correlation will certainly exist, meaning that the developers above are looking at a huge number of patches. This work often goes unsung, but it is a crucial part of the kernel development process; without it, the process would not run as smoothly or as quickly as it does now. 

Testing and bug reporting can also be tracked by tags in the associated patches. Looking at those tags for 4.11 yields this table: 

> Testing and bug reporting in 4.11  
> ---  
> | Reported-by tags  
> ---  
> Dmitry Vyukov| 47| 6.9%  
> Dan Carpenter| 47| 6.9%  
> kbuild test robot| 31| 4.5%  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman| 12| 1.8%  
> Andrey Konovalov| 10| 1.5%

Again, most of the activity out there does not result in explicit tags, especially when it comes to testing — many testers will say nothing if they do not run into problems. Regardless of whether testing and reporting are credited or not, they are critical to our ability to deliver a solid kernel over a nine or ten-week development cycle.

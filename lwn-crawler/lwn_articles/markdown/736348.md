# unsafe_put_user() turns out to be unsafe [LWN.net]

When a veteran kernel developer introduces a severe security hole into the
kernel, it can be instructive to look at how the vulnerability came about.
Among other things, it can point the finger at an API that lends itself
toward the creation of such problems.  And, as it turns out, the knowledge
that the API is dangerous at the outset and marking it as such may not be
enough to prevent problems.
Back in late 2015, kernel developers were looking for ways to speed up the
movement of data between user space and kernel space.  Accessing user data
from the kernel, whether for reading or writing, has clear security
implications, so the kernel must ensure that the requested access is
something that the requester is allowed to do.  That involves checking that
the intended area of memory is indeed accessible; on newer hardware, it can
also require temporarily disabling mechanisms like
supervisor mode access prevention (SMAP)
.
Those preparations are expensive relative to a simple data copy, and they
can add up if the kernel must perform a sequence of several reads and/or
writes to user space.
The obvious solution is to do the preparations once for a series of operations,
then perform the operations themselves directly; that amortizes the cost of
a single set of checks across multiple accesses.  To that end, Linus
Torvalds
added
a new set of access functions
for the 4.5 kernel:
unsafe_get_user(value, source);
    unsafe_put_user(value, destination);
These "functions" are actually macros that expand differently depending on
the type of
source
or
destination
.  If, for example,
source
is a pointer to a
u16
value, then
unsafe_get_user()
will fetch an unsigned 16-bit value from that
location and store it in
value
.  These functions are thus like the
traditional
get_user()
and
put_user()
macros, but with
one change: they dispense with the normal permission checking.
The lack of checks is the clear motivation for the "unsafe" naming, even
if, according to
the
comments in the code
, that term does not really apply:
/*
     * The "unsafe" user accesses aren't really "unsafe", but the naming
     * is a big fat warning: you have to not only do the access_ok()
     * checking before using them, but you have to surround them with the
     * user_access_begin/end() pair.
     */
The required
access_ok()
call ensures that the pointer involved
refers to a user-space address; it is there to prevent user space from
asking the kernel to overwrite itself.  The
user_access_begin()
and
user_access_end()
calls, instead, disable and enable SMAP.
The whole idea behind the "unsafe" functions is that
access_ok()
and (especially)
user_access_begin()
can be called once before
several user-space accesses, thus speeding up the code overall.
During the 4.13 merge window, Al Viro
reworked
the implementation of the
waitid()
system call
to use the "unsafe" functions.  This variant of
wait()
requests that the kernel fill in a
siginfo_t
structure in user space with information on how the waited-for process
died; doing so requires writing several values to user space from the
kernel.  The new code switched to
unsafe_put_user()
to speed these
writes.  Viro duly called
user_access_begin()
and
user_access_end()
, but left out the
access_ok()
calls.
As a result, a call to
waitid()
could ask that the
siginfo_t
structure be stored in kernel space, overwriting a piece
of kernel memory.  Local attackers tend to be most pleased by this sort of
unintended functionality.
The result is deemed CVE-2017-5123; it only affects the 4.13 and 4.14-rc
kernels.  It is fixed by
this
commit
in the mainline, and will be fixed in the
4.13.7 stable update
. 
The good news is that it was caught early enough that the number of
machines that are exposed to the problem should be quite small.
The bad news, of course, is that it happened at all.  It turns out that
this was
the first use of
unsafe_put_user()
in the mainline kernel; this use was written
by a developer who understands the issues involved, and he still got it
wrong.  Even better, the patch tickled a bug in that until-then unused function,
with the result that Torvalds looked at the specific patch in question, but
the problem still was not noticed.  It would seem that, contrary to the
comments, the "unsafe" functions are well named indeed, and that truly
unsafe use does not jump out at people looking at the code â€” even if the
functions proclaim themselves to be unsafe.
Hopefully reviewers in the future will be better tuned into the fact that
there are two necessary preconditions to the use of those functions.  Even
better would be some code that runs in kernels configured for debugging
that would detect a lack of checking and raise the alarm.  It might well be
possible to apply some sort of static checking to the problem as well.
Without such assistance, it seems likely that this type of bug will find
its way into the kernel again in the future; it may not be so quickly
detected next time.

During the 2012 Kernel Summit
memcg/mm
minisummit
, Greg Thelen and Michel Lespinasse led a session on
improving shared-memory accounting for memory cgroups. Currently, memory
cgroups memory usage accounting is done by charging each page to the first
user to touch each page.  In practice, this is usually okay, but it is
potentially unfair when that page is shared.  The process that faults the
page could exit, but the cgroup is still charged for the page.  Greg
described another example where a pair of processes that are implemented as
a producer/consumer, with each process running in separate cgroups, may be
unfairly charged if they share the data using shared memory.  His idea is
that both producer and consumer have to touch the memory, and they should
be charged equally for the resource.  With the current implementation, the
process that is charged is the one that first touches the
memoryâ€”i.e., the producer.  He would like to do something about this
problem.
One suggestion was to extend the
madvise()
system call to allow
a process to claim ownership of any pages currently mapped in a specified
range, but this would solve only some specific subsets of the problem.  It
may also be required that all future charges in an address range get
charged to a specific cgroup, although it was unclear how this could be
specified in a sensible fashion. Minimally, using
madvise()
would
assume that the data was
mmap()
ed.  Greg was asked to post a patch
series for comment, and discussion will continue on the mailing list.

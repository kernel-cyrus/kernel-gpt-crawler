LogFS is a longstanding project by Jörn Engel to create a filesystem for contemporary solid-state storage devices; it was last [covered here](http://lwn.net/Articles/234441/) in May, 2007. Since then, LogFS has mostly disappeared from view. As of November 20, though, [LogFS is back](http://lwn.net/Articles/363198/) and, seemingly, ready for a mainline merge. Jörn says: 

Logfs has been around a couple of times. Linus last word was "go and don't come back until all format changes are done". Or something along those lines at least. Format changes are done. And I don't even intend to break git-bisect for anyone crazy enough to use logfs for /. 

Sufficiently crazy users seem to be relatively scarce so far. But having more options for upcoming hardware can only be a good thing; it will be interesting to see what results come out as people start to play with this new filesystem.

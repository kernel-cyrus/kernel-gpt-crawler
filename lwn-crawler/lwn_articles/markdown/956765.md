The 6.7 kernel was [released](/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=widprp4XoHUcsDe7e16YZjLYJWra-dK0hE1MnfPMf6C3Q@mail.gmail.com/) on January 7 after a ten-week development cycle. This was, as it turns out, the busiest cycle ever with regard to the number of changesets merged. The time has come for our usual look at where all those changesets came from, with a side trip into how long kernel developers tend to stick around. 

The 6.7 kernel saw the addition of 17,284 non-merge changesets to the mainline — the most for any development cycle ever. To a great extent, this volume is due to the merging of the [bcachefs](https://bcachefs.org/) filesystem along with its full development history; bcachefs was responsible for nearly 3,000 commits in 6.7. Otherwise, it was a fairly normal cycle, incorporating the work of 1,973 developers (267 of whom made their first contribution in 6.7) and growing the kernel by 566,000 lines of code. 

The most active developers this time around were:

As might be expected, bcachefs developer Kent Overstreet found himself at the top of both columns by a wide margin. Uwe Kleine-König continues to refactor APIs within the device-driver subsystem. Kees Cook's contributions mostly consisted of adding [`counted_by`](/Articles/936728/) attributes to kernel data structures. Johannes Berg continued his work as the WiFi maintainer, and Thomas Gleixner made significant changes throughout the x86 and serial-port code. 

After Overstreet in the lines-changed column, Qingqing Zhuo, Benjamin Li, and Lang Yu all worked on the amdgpu driver, adding more of the inevitable register-definition header files among other things. Ard Biesheuvel resisted the growth of the kernel this time around by [removing the Itanium architecture](/Articles/950466/).

Daniel Wheeler continues to test nearly five times as many patches as anybody else in his work with the amdgpu driver. Philipp Hortmann tested a set of Realtek patches in the staging tree, and Pucha Himasekhar Reddy did testing of Intel network-driver patches. 

On the review side, Gustavo A. R. Silva reviewed the `counted_by` patches, among others. AngeloGioacchino Del Regno reviewed patches throughout the driver subsystem. Simon Horman reviewed networking patches, and Kees Cook reviewed (mostly) hardening-related patches tree-wide. Andy Shevchenko reviewed numerous driver patches. . Despite occasional worries that some developers may be trying to game the statistics by offering "Reviewed-by" tags that do not reflect real reviews, the developers showing up on this list seem to be doing real work.

Perhaps the most noteworthy thing that jumps out of these otherwise normal-looking numbers is the significant percentage of code coming from developers without any affiliation. Once again, the answer is bcachefs: rather than developing within the confines of a company, Overstreet has done this work on his own, [supported by interested users](https://www.patreon.com/bcachefs) on Patreon. 

#### Developer longevity

At the [2023 Maintainers Summit](/Articles/951847/), there was some discussion about the community's balance between new developers and those with long experience with the kernel. Clearly both are needed for a healthy community. By throwing some computing resources at the kernel's Git repository, one can try to gain some insight into that question. 

So how much experience does each contributor to the 6.7 kernel have? One way to look at it is to count how many kernel releases each 6.7 contributor has commits in. The results, for the period of time covered by the Git repository (since 2.6.12 in 2005), look like this: 

> **Releases contributed to by 6.7 developers** Releases| Count  
> ---|---  
> 1| 267 | 267  
> 2-5 | 446 | 446  
> 6-10 | 300 | 300  
> 11-15 | 172 | 172  
> 16-20 | 130 | 130  
> 21-25 | 96 | 96  
> 26-30 | 86 | 86  
> 31-35 | 75 | 75  
> 36-40 | 60 | 60  
> 41-45 | 43 | 43  
> 46-50 | 47 | 47  
> 51-55 | 43 | 43  
> 56-60 | 22 | 22  
> 61-65 | 25 | 25  
> 66-70 | 26 | 26  
> 71-75 | 30 | 30  
> 76-80 | 23 | 23  
> 81-85 | 27 | 27  
> 86-90 | 19 | 19  
> 91-95 | 23 | 23  
> 96-97 | 18 | 18  
  
The top line represents the 267 developers who contributed for the first time in this development cycle — they have exactly one release under their belts. The next line shows the 446 developers who have contributed to between two and five releases, and so on. 

There have been 97 mainline releases in the Git era, starting with 2.6.12. There are, as it turns out, 11 developers who have participated in all 97 of those releases: Al Viro, David Howells, David S. Miller, Dmitry Torokhov, Greg Kroah-Hartman, Linus Torvalds, Rafael J. Wysocki, Randy Dunlap, Russell King, Takashi Iwai, and Trond Myklebust. Another seven (Jens Axboe, Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, Michael Ellerman, Ingo Molnar, Thomas Gleixner, Paul E. McKenney, and Catalin Marinas) have only missed a single cycle during this time. 

What we see here is that approximately half of the developers who contributed to 6.7 have a maximum of ten releases of development experience. The other half has more, with over 250 developers having contributed to at least 50 different kernel releases. So it would appear that there is indeed a wide spread of experience across the community. 

Another way of looking at the picture is to see when each developer made their first contribution; by looking at the year in which the first patch was written, the following comes out: 

> **Year of first contribution, 6.7 developers** Year| Count  
> ---|---  
> 2024 | 1 | 1  
> 2023 | 458 | 458  
> 2022 | 198 | 198  
> 2021 | 174 | 174  
> 2020 | 114 | 114  
> 2019 | 105 | 105  
> 2018 | 101 | 101  
> 2017 | 89 | 89  
> 2016 | 78 | 78  
> 2015 | 80 | 80  
> 2014 | 95 | 95  
> 2013 | 60 | 60  
> 2012 | 40 | 40  
> 2011 | 47 | 47  
> 2010 | 51 | 51  
> 2009 | 47 | 47  
> 2008 | 43 | 43  
> 2007 | 43 | 43  
> 2006 | 54 | 54  
> 2005 | 99 | 99  
> 2002 | 1 | 1  
  
The kernel community, as can be seen here, has already gotten its first new contributor for 2024. Overall the picture is similar; about half of the contributors to 6.7 have been working in the kernel for five years or less, while quite a few others have been around for the entire Git era. 

Should one wonder about the lone developer showing as starting in 2002; it turns out that there are a few commits made in the early days with somewhat surprising dates; Kroah-Hartman, in particular, has a lot of commits with dates from the few years prior to the beginning of the Git era. The clear winner, though, will be Ursula Braun with [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=224426f168aa) claiming to be from that heyday of Linux kernel development: January 1, 1970. 

As we have seen, not every developer contributes to every kernel release, so it might make sense to look at a longer time period. If, instead of looking at just 6.7, we look at all the releases from 6.2 to 6.7 (being approximately the work done in 2023), the results come out this way: 

> **Releases contributed to by 6.2-6.7 developers** Releases| Count  
> ---|---  
> 1| 1135 | 1135  
> 2-5 | 1433 | 1433  
> 6-10 | 696 | 696  
> 11-15 | 428 | 428  
> 16-20 | 258 | 258  
> 21-25 | 197 | 197  
> 26-30 | 161 | 161  
> 31-35 | 138 | 138  
> 36-40 | 98 | 98  
> 41-45 | 69 | 69  
> 46-50 | 69 | 69  
> 51-55 | 62 | 62

> 86-90 | 22 | 22  
> 91-95 | 26 | 26  
> 96-97 | 18 | 18  
> **Year of first contribution, 6.2-6.7 developers** Year| Count  
> ---|---  
> 2024 | 1 | 1  
> 2023 | 1298 | 1298  
> 2022 | 781 | 781  
> 2021 | 426 | 426  
> 2020 | 306 | 306  
> 2019 | 258 | 258  
> 2018 | 242 | 242  
> 2017 | 215 | 215  
> 2016 | 179 | 179  
> 2015 | 176 | 176  
> 2014 | 180 | 180  
> 2013 | 119 | 119  
> 2012 | 101 | 101  
> 2011 | 115 | 115  
> 2010 | 104 | 104  
> 2009 | 90 | 90  
> 2008 | 77 | 77  
> 2007 | 76 | 76  
> 2006 | 98 | 98  
> 2005 | 179 | 179  
> 2004 | 2 | 2  
> 2002 | 1 | 1  
  
There were contributions from 5,024 developers during this time period; just over half of them have contributed to a maximum of five releases. This pattern could indicate that the community has a healthy mix of new developers; it might also suggest, though, that a lot of developers do not stick around for a large number of releases. 

A certain amount of churn is to be expected in any development community; people come in with a problem to solve, then move on once that work is done. Inexplicably, not everybody has a passion for kernel development. Whether the kernel community's churn is excessive is not a straightforward question to answer. On the one hand, each release sees between 200 and 300 first-time developers come into our community, but the number of developers contributing to each release is not really growing, suggesting that people are leaving as quickly as they are arriving. On the other, the plot above shows that, in any given year out of the last 18, the community has gained developers who have turned into long-term contributors. 

That doesn't mean that the kernel community would not benefit from a higher level of retention of contributors, of course. It is worth taking the question of why people leave the community — and why the diversity of the group that remains is so low — more seriously. One might (or might not) argue that the state of the kernel community is not terribly unhealthy now, but it would be difficult indeed to argue that there isn't substantial room for improvement.

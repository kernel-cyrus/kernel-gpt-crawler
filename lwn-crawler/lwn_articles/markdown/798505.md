It's that time of the development cycle again: work on the 5.3 kernel is winding down with an expected final release date of September 15. Read on for LWN's traditional look at where the code in 5.3 came from in this relatively busy development cycle. 

As of this writing, 14,435 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline repository for 5.3; these changes were contributed by 1,846 developers. That makes 5.3 one of the busier cycles in recent times: 

> Release| Changesets| Developers  
> ---|---|---  
> 4.15| 14,866 | 1,801  
> 4.16| 13,630 | 1,805  
> 4.17| 13,541 | 1,713  
> 4.18| 13,283 | 1,728  
> 4.19| 14,043 | 1,752  
> 4.20| 13,884 | 1,749  
> 5.0| 12,808 | 1,757  
> 5.1| 13,034 | 1,737  
> 5.2| 14,024 | 1,783  
> 5.3| 14,435 | 1,846  
  
The traffic in 5.3 thus did not set a new record; indeed, 4.9, with 16,214 changesets merged, seems likely to hold that record for a while yet. The 1,846 developers contributing during this cycle _is_ a new high, though, suggesting that the kernel community is still growing; 256 of those developers were first-time contributors. 

Those 1,846 developers deleted an impressive 389,000 lines of code from the kernel during this cycle. They also added 973,000 lines, though, so the kernel grew by 584,000 lines of code. The most active developers this time around were:

The biggest contributor of changesets this time around was Kuninori Morimoto, who did a lot of work updating code in the sound subsystem. Christoph Hellwig made significant improvements across the core kernel and the block subsystem, Mauro Carvalho Chehab converted a vast number of documentation files to the restructured text format, Nishka Dasgupta fixed a large number of Coccinelle warnings, and Chris Wilson worked extensively on the Intel i915 graphics driver. 

Hawking Zhang was responsible for nearly one-third of the changed lines in 5.3; as is so often the case, the new code is yet another set of register definitions for the `amdgpu` graphics driver. Arnd Bergmann removed the old ISDN subsystem and, as usual, made improvements across the kernel tree. Harry Wentland also contributed AMD graphics driver changes, and Jason Gunthorpe removed some obsolete RDMA code. 

The top testers and reviewers this time around were:

The biggest collector of Tested-by credits is Andrew Bowers, a developer who has never contributed a patch to the kernel, but who seemingly does extensive testing of changes to various Intel drivers. Review credits are more evenly spread out, though still concentrated on subsystems that require reviews before merging. 4,824 Patches in 5.3 (33% of the total) carried Reviewed-by tags; that is higher than the long-term average but slightly less than the number seen in 5.2. 

The Reported-by tags, applied to give credit to the reporter of a problem, are worth a quick look as well. There were 687 patches with such tags merged for 5.3, with the top reporters being: 

> Reported-by credits in 5.3   
> ---  
> Hulk Robot| 89| 10.7%  
> kbuild test robot| 62| 7.5%  
> Stephen Rothwell| 37| 4.4%  
> Dan Carpenter| 24| 2.9%  
> syzbot| 18| 2.2%  
> Randy Dunlap| 11| 1.3%  
> Geert Uytterhoeven| 9| 1.1%  
> Guenter Roeck| 9| 1.1%  
> kernel test robot| 9| 1.1%  
> Arnd Bergmann| 8| 1.0%  
  
Of the top five bug reporters, three are automated testing systems, one is the linux-next maintainer (linux-next being the first point of integration testing for many patches), and one is a developer who aggressively looks for (and fixes) bugs with a static-analysis tool. In other words, it is fair to say that the testing mechanisms that have slowly been built up around the kernel process are having an effect, catching bugs before they can affect users. 

That said, it's worth noting that 2,026 changes in 5.3 — 14% of the total — carry Fixes: tags, implying that they are fixes for bugs that _did_ make it into the mainline. Many fixes undoubtedly are merged without the addition of a Fixes: tag, so the actual percentage of bug fixes is certain to be significantly higher than that. Clearly, there is plenty of scope for improving our testing infrastructure and procedures still. 

Finally, 233 companies (that we were able to identify) supported work on the 5.3 kernel. The most active of these companies were:

As usual, there are few surprises to be found in the above table. The list of the most active companies does not tend to vary much from one development cycle to the next. 

Overall, the picture that emerges is of a development community that continues to integrate massive numbers of changes on a predictable schedule, and which continues to grow slowly. For all its faults, the kernel development community is clearly doing some things right.

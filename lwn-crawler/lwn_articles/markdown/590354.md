Normally, by the time the [-rc6 prepatch](/Articles/590145/) is released in a given development cycle, the final release is thought to be not too far away. This time around, Linus is making noises about needing to go as far as -rc8 or even -rc9 due to the number of outstanding problems. Even if we are still a few weeks from release, the situation with 3.14 will be stable enough that a look at where the changes in this release came from makes sense. The picture that emerges can be described as "business as usual," with the continuation of some longstanding trends. 

As of this writing, the 3.14 development cycle has seen the addition of just over 12,000 non-merge changesets from exactly 1,400 developers. These changes added 591,000 lines of code while removing 250,000 lines, for a net growth of 341,000 lines. The most active developers this time around were:

After a brief absence, H. Hartley Sweeten has returned to the top of the "by changesets" list with more work on the seemingly interminable project of fixing up the Comedi drivers in the staging tree. Laurent Pinchart did a lot of work in the Video4Linux and ARM architecture trees, while Jingoo Han continues to work on cleaning up the driver tree. Rashika Kheria, an Outreach Program for Women participant, contributed lots of driver cleanup patches, and Geert Uytterhoeven did a lot of work in the m68k architecture and embedded driver subsystems. 

Greg Kroah-Hartman often appears near the top of the "lines changed" column; this time, it is as the result of the addition of the Realtek 8821 PCI WIFI driver and more than the usual number of reverted patches. Micky Ching added the rts5208 and rts5288 drivers to the staging tree, Stephen Boyd added a bunch of Qualcomm hardware support, Paul Gortmaker did (among other things) a bunch of header file cleanups, and Greg Rose contributed the Intel i40evf network driver. 

At least 210 employers supported work on the 3.14 kernel. The most active of these employers were:

There are few surprises here; instead, this table shows the continuation of some trends we have been seeing for a while. After [a short-lived jump in 3.13](/Articles/579081/), the number of contributions from volunteers is back to its long-term decline. Intel seems to have taken a permanent place at the top of the list of changeset contributors. Contributions from the mobile and embedded industry continue to grow. It's tempting to call out the fact that 3.14 will contain a fix to the nouveau driver that came directly from NVIDIA, but this turns out to be the second time that has happened; the [first fix from NVIDIA](http://git.kernel.org/linus/ab9ccb96a6e6f95bcde6b8b2a524370efdbfdcd6) was quietly merged for 3.9 in early 2013. 

A slightly different picture emerges if one looks at non-author signoffs — Signed-off-by tags applied to patches by developers other than the author. Such tags are applied by subsystem maintainers as they accept patches; the statistics can thus indicate who the gatekeepers to the kernel are. Associating signoffs with employers leads to these results:

The concentration of companies here is reduced from what it once was, but it is still true that more than half of the patches that were merged into 3.14 went by way of the employees of just four organizations. Linaro and Facebook are moving up the list; in both cases, this has mostly been done by hiring developers who were already working as subsystem maintainers. Here, too, the presence of volunteer developers has been slowly declining over time. 

All told, the kernel development machine appears to be in a relatively steady state, with things running smoothly and changes happening over relatively long periods of time. Your editor is thus curious to know whether these reports remain useful on a per-release basis. Perhaps it makes sense to scale them back to, say, an annual exercise where the long-term trends might be more pronounced. This is a question that will be considered over the course of the 3.15 development cycle.

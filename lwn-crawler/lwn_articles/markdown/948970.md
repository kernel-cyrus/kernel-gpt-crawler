The 6.6 kernel was [released](/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wiZuU984NWVgP4snp8sEt4Ux5Mp_pxAN5MNV9VpcGUo+A@mail.gmail.com/), right on schedule, on October 29. This development cycle saw the addition of 14,069 non-merge changesets from 1,978 developers — fairly typical numbers for recent releases. The time has come for LWN's traditional look at where the changes in this release came from, along with a look at the longer development "supercycle" that (probably) ends with 6.6. 

Of the developers contributing to 6.6, 249 were new to the kernel community, again a fairly typical number. The most active 6.6 developers were:

Krzysztof Kozlowski is, once again, at the top of the list of changeset contributors, having done a great deal of work in the devicetree subsystem. Yangtao Li mostly converted large numbers of drivers to use [`devm_platform_iomap_resource()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.9/source/drivers/base/platform.c#L111). Konrad Dybcio worked mostly with devicetree files and Qualcomm drivers, Rob Herring worked extensively on devicetree-related code, and Thomas Zimmermann made many improvements to a range of graphics and frame-buffer drivers. 

Developers often end up at the top of the "lines changed" column by virtue of a a small number of large patches. Jiri Pirko, instead, contributed 72 smaller patches refactoring and improving parts of the network-driver subsystem; Dybcio got there in a similar fashion. Ian Rogers made a number of changes (including [removing perf BPF event support](https://git.kernel.org/linus/3d6dfae88917)) to the perf events subsystem, Dmitry Baryshkov worked with Qualcomm drivers, and Charles Keepax added the cs42l43 audio driver.

Daniel Wheeler, as usual, applies Tested-by tags to AMD GPU driver patches. Michael Kelley, Juergen Groess, and Sohil Mehta, instead, all tested the same set of [x86 "APIC decrapification" patches](/ml/linux-kernel/20230801103042.936020332@linutronix.de/) from Thomas Gleixner. Overall, 1,067 patches (just under 8% of the total) merged for 6.6 contained Tested-by tags. 

Simon Horman is the review champion for 6.6, having managed to review more than five networking patches for every day of this development cycle. There were 6,386 patches in 6.6 with Reviewed-by tags, or 45% of the total.

Once again, there are few surprises here. 

#### Closing the supercycle

In the absence of surprises, 6.6 will be the final release for 2023 and, as a result, the next long-term-support kernel release, with stable updates coming for the next two years. Since the LTS kernels are the ones that are actually used on most systems, the one-year LTS cycle represents a sort of kernel development supercycle. It thus makes some sense to look at contributions for that supercycle as a whole. 

The last LTS kernel was 6.1, released on December 11, 2022. Since then, 72,425 non-merge changesets have found their way into the mainline, contributed by 4,598 developers, 1,359 of whom were first-time contributors. The most active developers were:

The two most active developers each managed to crank out just short of six patches per day — every day — in the 322 days that separated the two LTS releases; 19 developers contributed at least one patch per day during that time. Two of the biggest contributors of new lines of code, Ian Rogers and Hawking Zhang, added Intel perf event definitions and AMD GPU register definitions, respectively. Arnd Bergmann, instead, managed to _delete_ over 170,000 lines of code during this period. 

The employer numbers for this time period look like this:

One other statistic that can be worth a look is the application of Signed-off-by tags by developers other than the author of any given patch. Those tags are added whenever a maintainer applies a patch to a repository, bringing it into the Git-based flow. Looking at non-author signoffs, thus, can provide a picture of who the busiest maintainers are. For the extended 6.6 cycle, the results are:

Greg Kroah-Hartman fell just short of applying ten patches every day, including weekends and holidays, during this period — and that does not count all of the patches that he herds into the stable kernels. On the employer side, it's evident that there are still relatively few companies that employ maintainers; over 50% of the changes going into the kernel pass through the hands of maintainers working for just five companies. 

The kernel's development process continues at full speed, producing a new major release every nine or ten weeks. The 6.7 release is more likely to be ten weeks than nine as a result of the upcoming holiday season. It is also likely to be a big release; there are, as of this writing, nearly 16,000 changesets waiting in linux-next. As always, keep an eye on LWN to stay on top of what is happening as this next cycle unfolds.

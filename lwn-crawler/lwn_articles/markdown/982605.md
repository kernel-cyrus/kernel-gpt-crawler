The release of [6.11-rc1](/ml/all/CAHk-=wiyNokz0d3b=GRORij=mGvwoYHy=+bv6m2Hu_VqNdg66g@mail.gmail.com/) marked the end of the 6.11 merge window on July 28. By that time, 12,102 non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline repository; about 8,000 of those came in after [the first-half summary](/Articles/982034/) was written. Quite a few significant changes were to be found in those changesets; there is also one big change that did not make it. 

Some of the most interesting changes pulled into the mainline in the latter part of the 6.11 merge window include: 

#### Architecture-specific

  * There is a new implementation of the AES-GCM cipher for x86-64 systems. The resulting performance improvement is always welcome, but this contribution is also noteworthy for the extensive documentation of the code and how it works; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b06affb1cb58) for the whole thing. 
  * Support for PowerPC 40x platforms has been removed. 
  * Memory hotplugging support has been added for RISC-V systems. 
  * The [kernel memory sanitizer (KMSAN)](https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/kmsan.html) is now supported on s/390 systems. 
  * RISC-V systems have gained support for the [STACKLEAK](/Articles/764325/) security feature. 



#### Core kernel

  * There is a new system call, `uretprobe()`, that is currently only implemented on x86-64 systems. Its job is to optimize the handling of [uretprobes](https://docs.kernel.org/trace/uprobetracer.html) (function-return tracepoints dynamically inserted into a user-space process); nothing good will come if a process tries to call it directly. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/ff474a78cef5) for a description of how it works and [this LSFMM+BPF report](/Articles/978335/) for some more information on the use case that motivated it. 
  * The single-user limit for the [function-graph tracer](https://docs.kernel.org/trace/ftrace.html#function-graph-tracer) has been removed. 
  * The new `reserve_mem=` command-line parameter can be used to set aside a named region of memory; it is intended to be used, in conjunction with the new `ramoops.mem_name=` parameter, with the [pstore](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/pstore-blk.html) subsystem. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/1e4c64b71c9b) and [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d9d814eebb1a) for details. 
  * The control-group memory controller now supports a `swappiness=` parameter. It allows proactive-reclaim algorithms to set the balance between swapping (reclaiming anonymous pages) and reclaiming file-backed pages. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/68cd9050d871) for details. 
  * There is a new `ioctl()` interface to the memory-layout information found in `/proc/_PID_ /maps` that allows for more efficient access. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/c10cb9148e51) for minimal documentation, [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/ed5d583a88a9) for a long description of the work and the use case it addresses, and [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/81510a0eaa69) for test code showing how it is used. 



#### Filesystems and block I/O

  * The Btrfs filesystem recognizes a couple of new values (`ignoremetacsums` and `ignoresuperflags`) for the `rescue=` mount option; they are meant to assist in the recovery of filesystems that may have been partially converted by user-space tools (those that do checksum conversion in particular). 
  * The way that Btrfs does block-group reclaim has been improved in the hope of avoiding situations where free space is unavailable even though the filesystem is not full. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/f5ff64ccf7bb) for a description of how the new dynamic reclaim threshold works. 
  * The ntfs3 filesystem has gained support for the "compressed" and "immutable" attributes on files.

#### Miscellaneous

  * The `perf` tool has a number of new features; see [this changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/68b59730459e) for the full list. 
  * A small set of [Rust abstractions for firmware loading](https://git.kernel.org/linus/de6582833db0) has been merged. There are still many pieces needed before nontrivial drivers can be written in Rust, but the list is slowly getting smaller. Other merged abstractions include `uaccess` (user-space access) and `page` (for working with `struct page`). 
  * While the minimum version of Rust needed to build kernel code remains 1.78.0, it is now also possible to use versions 1.79.0 or 1.80.0 as well. The plan is to broaden the range of applicable compiler versions over time. 



#### Security-related

  * The [dedicated bucket slab allocator](/Articles/965837/) has been merged; it is intended to provide protection against heap-spraying attacks. 
  * The generation of random data will be greatly accelerated by the new [vDSO implementation of `getrandom()`](/Articles/980447/). The implementation has changed somewhat since that article was written, though; see [this update](/Articles/983186/) for the details. Among other things, this work has added a new `MAP_DROPPABLE` flag for [`mmap()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html) that requests memory that can be dropped by the kernel if need be. 



#### Virtualization and containers

  * There is now initial support for AMD's [SEV-SNP](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html) secure encrypted virtualization mechanism in KVM, built on top of the architecture-level support added earlier in the merge window. 
  * There is a new KVM `ioctl()` call to pre-populate a guest's memory before it runs; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/9aed7a6c0b59) for documentation. 



#### Internal kernel changes

  * The minimum version of GNU Make needed to build the kernel has been raised to 4.0. 
  * There were 118 exported symbols removed from 6.11, and 464 additions, for a net growth of 346; there are also six new kfuncs. See [this page](/Articles/983762/) for the full list. 



On June 11, Linus Torvalds [announced](/Articles/978007/) that the [extensible scheduler class](/Articles/922405/) ("sched_ext") would be merged for 6.11. After that came [a strongly worded discussion](/ml/all/87ed8sps71.ffs@tglx/) about whether that step was justified, or whether sched_ext needed more work first. The conclusion, it would seem, is that another development cycle (at least) will be taken toward improving this code; sched_ext was _not_ merged for 6.11. There have been some more constructive conversations about this code since then, though, so it seems likely that it will get there eventually. 

Meanwhile, the work that _was_ merged will need to be stabilized over the next seven or eight weeks. The most likely date for the 6.11 kernel to be released is September 15 â€” just in time for the 6.12 merge window to land on top of the Open Source Summit Europe, Maintainers Summit, and Linux Plumbers Conference. But first, there will be a lot of testing and bug fixing to be done. 

(As a reminder, LWN subscribers can look into the [LWN Kernel Source Database](/ksdb/releases/v6.11/) for a lot of details on where the code pulled for 6.11 came from).

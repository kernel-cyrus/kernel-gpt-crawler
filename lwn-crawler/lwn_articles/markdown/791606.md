As of this writing, just over 13,600 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline repository for the 5.2 development cycle. The time has come, once again, for a look at where that work came from and who supported it. There are some unique aspects to 5.2 that have thrown off some of the usual numbers. 

1,716 developers contributed changes for the 5.2 kernel, 245 of whom made their first contribution during this cycle. Those 1,716 developers removed nearly 490,000 lines of code, which is a lot, but the addition of 596,000 new lines of code means that the kernel still grew by 106,000 lines. The most active developers this time around were:

Of the 441 patches that put Thomas Gleixner at the top of the "by changesets" column, 349 were a part of the ongoing effort to [add SPDX tags](/Articles/739183/) to every kernel source file. That still leaves nearly 100 changes for little issues like the the [microarchitectural data sampling vulnerabilities](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/mds.html#mds), reworking the handling of stack traces, and more. Alexandre Belloni contributed a long list of realtime clock changes, Yue Haibing made code cleanups all over the tree, Chris Wilson made many changes to the i915 graphics driver, and Guenter Roeck made a lot of improvements to the hardware monitoring and watchdog subsystems. 

In the "lines changed" column, Greg Kroah-Hartman deleted the rtlwifi driver from the staging tree; it has been superseded by a non-staging driver. One might not think that adding a single SPDX line to files would lead to a lot of changed lines, even when a lot of files are involved, but most of those additions also allowed the removal of a lot of license boilerplate. As a result, Gleixner's SPDX work resulted in the removal of over 100,000 lines from the kernel. Yan-Hsuan Chuang only contributed three changes, but they brought in the new production Realtek driver, which is not small. Gabriel Krisman Bertazi added support for [case-insensitive file-name lookups](/Articles/784041/) to the ext4 filesystem; that, in turn, brought in a large body of automatically-generated code for [UTF-8 handling](/Articles/784124/). Liam Girdwood add the [Sound Open Firmware](/Articles/749888/) system.

Andrew Bowers apparently tested a large number of i40e network-driver patches written by co-workers at Intel. Then, there are some familiar names in the review column. People like Allison Randal, Kate Stewart, and Richard Fontana are all quite well known in our community, but they tend not to show up often in kernel patches. In this case, all of them spent time (along with Alexios Zavras and Armijn Hemel) reviewing the SPDX changes. This is important work: the addition of SPDX lines must reflect the actual license of each file and not inadvertently change that license.

There are few surprises here, as usual. It is nice to see Realtek showing up as a top contributor, though — a change from the recent past. 

When developers apply a Signed-off-by tag to a patch that they did not write, it is usually an indication that they are merging that patch into a subsystem tree. A look at non-author signoffs thus gives an idea of who the gatekeepers for the kernel are. In 5.2, the most active developers in this role, and the companies that supported them, are:

The concentration of subsystem maintainers into a small number of companies has spread out over time, but it is still true that (just) over 50% of the non-author signoffs are made by developers working in five companies. 

#### Code longevity

Finally, it has been a while since we have looked at how much code from each development cycle remains in the 5.2 kernel. This determination is made through the application of a fair amount of brute force: for each file in the kernel tree, `git blame` is run and the commit that added each line is noted. After associating each commit with the development cycle that brought it into the mainline, it is possible to see how many lines of code were introduced by each cycle. The results look like this: 

> ![\[Bar chart\]](https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/5.2-lines.svg)

As can be seen here, newer releases are more heavily represented than older ones, which is not surprising. There has been more time for changes to be made to code from older releases, and more recent cycles tend to add more lines in general. Still, it seems clear that a lot of the code we add stays in the kernel for a long time. 

The most graphic illustration of that, actually, does not appear in the graph because it would squeeze the rest into insignificance: over 2.5 million lines of code in the kernel — nearly 10% of the total — date back to the initial Git commit in 2005. Much of that code was old even then, and certainly hasn't gotten any younger. 

Stepping back one release, there are [215 files in 5.1](/Articles/791608/) that have not seen a single change since the initial commit. This number can only undercount the number of dormant files by a significant factor: any file that has seen even a single whitespace fix, coding-style change, or typo fix will not appear in this list. Indeed, the list was generated from the 5.1 kernel because the SPDX work in 5.2 is obscuring things further. These files may get shiny new license tags, but that won't make them any more alive. 

Code that is this old perhaps just reached perfection years ago and needs no further changes. In general, though, static code is often unmaintained, unused, and possibly insecure. For anybody looking to do a little cleanup work, this list might not be a bad place to start.

As of the [4.3-rc7](/Articles/661974/) release on October 25, the 4.3 development cycle appears to be headed for a conclusion on November 1, after the usual 63 days. It has been, by most appearances, an unremarkable development cycle, but it still saw the addition of a number of significant features; see the LWN merge window summaries ([part 1](/Articles/656267/), [part 2](/Articles/656731/), [part 3](/Articles/657325/)) for details. It also included contributions from a record number of developers; read on for a look at where the code for 4.3 came from. 

This development cycle has seen (so far) the inclusion of 12,131 non-merge changesets from an even 1,600 developers. The changeset count, while large, is far short of a record; it is also somewhat less than the 13,694 we saw for 4.2. This is the first cycle to hit 1,600 developers participating, though, beating 4.2's short-lived record of 1,591. The list of the most active developers includes some old names, along with a couple of new ones:

Ben Skeggs works with the Nouveau driver; this time around, he ended up at the top of both lists as the result of this work. The Nouveau tree missed the 4.2 merge window, so there are two cycles worth of patches showing up in 4.3. Other top changeset contributors include Viresh Kumar (mostly work adapting code to a new clockevents interface), Thomas Gleixner (changes to the interrupt-handling subsystem and fallout throughout the driver tree), Stephen Boyd (various driver-oriented patches, including some clock API changes), and Mateusz Kulikowski (cleanups to the rtl8192e driver in the staging tree). 

Below Ben in the "lines changed" column are Mike Marciniszyn (added the "hfil" InfiniBand driver, containing work by numerous authors), Dennis Dalessandro (moved the "ipath" InfiniBand driver to the staging tree in preparation for its eventual removal), Jan Kara (removal of the ext3 filesystem), and Doug Ledford (moved the "ehca" InfiniBand driver to staging in preparation for its eventual removal). 

The removal of code thus played a significant part of this development cycle. Even so, the net result of this cycle's patches was an addition of 382,000 lines to the kernel. 

Just under 200 employers (that we know of) supported work on the 4.3 kernels; the most active of those were:

This table looks much like it has in recent cycles. The percentage of changes from volunteers continues its long-term slide; the 5.8% seen here is the lowest ever. 

We may be getting fewer volunteer developers, but there are still plenty of developers entering the kernel community: 284 developers made their first kernel patch during the 4.3 development cycle. That is the most new developers for any development cycle ever — with one exception: 332 developers made their first patch to 2.6.25 in 2008. Of those 284 developers, 152 are already known to be working for a company; many of the remaining 132 will turn out to be employed as well. So starting as a volunteer is clearly not the path into the kernel community for most developers. 

Intel employs 22 of those new developers, Samsung employs eight, and IBM seven; no other company employed more than six new developers. The most popular place for new developers to start was the staging tree (56 developers made changes there), followed by `drivers/net` (23), and `arch/arm` (21). The rest of the first changes were spread all over the tree, though most of them touched something in the driver subtree. 

All told, the community continues to look healthy. There are more developers working on the kernel than ever before, and they are being introduced into the community by a wide variety of companies, many of which appear to be paying them to learn how to be kernel developers. The companies working in this area have clearly learned that they need to develop talent in-house to be able to participate in the process. That suggests that we will continue to have new developers showing up as long as Linux remains strong — an outcome that all those new developers will help assure.

The 5.9 kernel [was released on October 11](/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wi-u86++np80GQvgDuARdt9xpBNho6SjHLmYgm8jibGag@mail.gmail.com/), at the end of a ten-week development cycle — the first release to take more than nine weeks since 5.4 at the end of 2019. While this cycle was not as busy as 5.8, [which broke some records](/Articles/827735/), it was still one of the busier ones we have seen in some time, featuring 14,858 non-merge changesets contributed by 1,914 developers. Read on for our traditional look at what those developers were up to while creating the 5.9 release. 

Of the 1,914 developers contributing to 5.9, 306 made their first contribution for this release. This is the largest number of new contributors we have seen since 4.12 ([which had 334 first-time contributors](/Articles/726950/)) was released in 2017 and, indeed, the second-highest number ever seen. All together, the 5.9 contributors added just over 730,000 lines of code and removed nearly 262,000 for a net growth of 468,000 lines of code. The busiest developers this time around were:

The largest number of changesets going into 5.9 came from Lee Jones, who contributed many cleanups across the device-driver subsystem. Christoph Hellwig made substantive changes across a number of kernel subsystems; this work includes [the removal of `set_fs()`](/Articles/832121/) among many other things. Randy Dunlap removed duplicated words words from files all over the kernel tree, Alexander Klimov converted vast numbers of "HTTP" links to "HTTPS", and Ben Skeggs contributed a lot of improvements to the Nouveau graphics driver. 

The "lines contributed" column starts with Jerry (Fangzhi) Zuo, Likun Guo, and Bhawanpreet Lakha, all of whom added more code to the massive amdgpu graphics driver. Zuo only contributed two patches, but [one of them](https://git.kernel.org/linus/241b2ec9317e) was large (and consisted only of definitions of preprocessor symbols). Mike Rapoport removed the unloved unicore32 architecture and Edward Cree did a lot of work on the Solarflare SFC network driver. 

Overall, 207 employers supported work on the 5.9 kernel, a number that is consistent with previous releases. The most active employers were:

This is the first time in years that the largest number of changesets came from people who were working on their own time; it seems unlikely to be a change to the long-term trend toward smaller volunteer participation, but one never knows. Otherwise the employer numbers look about the same as they do in most months. 

The busiest testers and bug reporters for 5.9 were:

Automated testing systems continue to be the most prolific source of bug reports; they were responsible for just over one-third of the total in the 5.9 cycle. 

The developers with the most review credits this time around were: 

> Review credits in 5.9  
> ---  
> Rob Herring| 195| 3.0%  
> Alex Deucher| 162| 2.5%  
> David Sterba| 131| 2.0%  
> Lyude Paul| 130| 2.0%  
> Hawking Zhang| 121| 1.9%  
> Christoph Hellwig| 107| 1.7%  
> Florian Fainelli| 103| 1.6%  
> Andy Shevchenko| 95| 1.5%  
> Jiri Pirko| 82| 1.3%  
> Darrick J. Wong| 80| 1.2%  
  
A total of 5,235 commits for 5.9 contained Reviewed-by tags; that is 35% of the total, which is up slightly from 5.8. 

All told, 5.9 looks like another fairly routine development cycle that is a little busier than the average. Once again, it seems that the ongoing global pandemic has not hurt the pace of Linux kernel development; it might even possibly have encouraged the larger-than-normal number of changes from first-time and volunteer developers. The kernel community is clearly running at full speed as it heads into the 5.10 development cycle.

# A look at the 3.1 development cycle [LWN.net]

By **Jonathan Corbet**  
September 28, 2011 

As of this writing, the final 3.1 release is probably about one week or so away. That is just a bit later than had been expected; it is, of course, a natural result of the extended outage at kernel.org. At a little past 3.1-rc7, though, this kernel is complete enough for our traditional look at what happened during the development cycle. At 8,465 non-merge changesets, the 3.1 cycle is one of the slowest of recent times, but we had participation from about the usual number of developers (1,136) representing over 180 companies. The kernel grew by just over 125,000 lines this time around. 

The most active developers in the 3.1 cycle were:

Media drivers would appear to dominate the listings on the "by changesets" side. Takashi Iwai continues to be incredibly productive in the area of audio drivers; Mark Brown, too, works mostly in the audio area. Mauro Carvalho Chehab is the Video4Linux2 maintainer; all of his patches fall within that tree this time around. Roland Vossen, instead, contributed a large number of changes to the Broadcom wireless network driver. Russell King not only serves as the top-level ARM maintainer; he also made a number of changes in that tree this time.

Greg Kroah-Hartman has, once again, been the top changer of lines in the kernel. Once again, the bulk of his work is in the staging tree; this time, though, he got there by deleting a number of drivers that either were not going to make it into the mainline or were on their way out. Ralph Metzler only contributed five patches, but three of them added new drivers to the Video4Linux2 tree. Takashi Iwai shows at the top of both columns for his sound driver work, Vladislav Zolotarov contributed a single patch with a bunch of new Broadcom firmware, and Nicholas Bellinger continues to enhance the SCSI target code.

Broadcom's extensive work to move its wireless driver out of staging caused it to move to a higher than usual position on both lists. Also notable is the continued slow climb by companies like Texas Instruments and Samsung; Nokia, instead, appears to be about to fall out of the top 20. The handling of Linaro deserves an explanation: contributions by Linaro assignees is normally credited back to their home companies. Nonetheless, Linaro makes an appearance on its own here as the result of the work of an increasing number of engineers employed by the organization itself. 

Finally, here is a plot showing the number of changesets merged for each stabilization release (those after -rc1) for the last few development cycles:

The dark blue line represents the 3.1 development cycle; as might be expected, the number of changesets merged drops significantly after 3.1-rc4, which is when the kernel.org outage started. Both 3.1-rc5 and 3.1-rc6 were smaller than usual releases, but 3.1-rc7 has made up for some of the slowdown. It would appear that the subsystem maintainers affected by the outage have mostly managed to find new places to host their trees. The kernel development show manages to go on, even with the loss of its primary repository hosting site.

The [4.4-rc6](/Articles/668692/) kernel prepatch was released on December 20, right on schedule. The 4.4 development series as a whole appears to be on schedule, with the most probable release date for 4.4 final being January 3, after one more prepatch. Linus has suggested that he might delay the release for one week. Any such delay, though, would be to allow developers to recover from the holidays before starting a new merge window rather than anything needed to stabilize 4.4. 

So, naturally, it is about time to look at this cycle's development activity. As of this writing, there have been 12,854 non-merge changesets pulled into the mainline this time around. It has thus been a busy cycle, though it would be surprising if we reached the number of changes seen in 4.2 (13,694), or the all-time record (13,722) set for 3.15. 

The number of developers involved thus far is 1,548 — a large number, but slightly short of the 1,600 seen in 4.3. We may yet reach the 1,569 seen in the 4.2 cycle, though. Of those 1,548 contributors, 246 made their first kernel contribution in this development cycle — the lowest number since 3.13. The most active developers this time around were:

After an absence for a few development cycles, H. Hartley Sweeten is back at the top of the per-changeset list for the ongoing work on the Comedi drivers in the staging tree. This code, at just under 100,000 lines, has now seen nearly 8,000 patches — and the work continues. Mateusz Kulikowski worked entirely with the rtl8192e staging driver, while Chaehyun Lim and Leo Kim both fixed up the wilc1000 staging driver. Eric Biederman is engaged in a substantial reworking of how the network stack handles network namespaces, with an emphasis on proper handling of packets that cross namespaces. 

On the lines-changed side, Alex Deucher continues to work on the AMD graphics drivers, Sreekanth Reddy removed a bunch of code from the mpt2sas driver (and, as a result, was the developer removing the most code in this cycle), and Yuval Mintz added a couple of Qlogic Ethernet drivers. Christoph Hellwig did a fair amount of cleanup throughout the driver and block subsystems, while huangdaode (the only name that appears in the logs) added support for the Hisilicon network subsystem. 

The sum of these developers' effort resulted in the net addition of 242,000 lines of code to the kernel in this development cycle. 

Work on 4.4 was supported by 202 employers that we could identify, a slight increase from 4.3. The most active companies working on 4.4 were:

For many years, Red Hat stood alone at the top of both columns of this list. That situation has been changing for some time; at this point, it is more than fair to say that Red Hat has ceased to be the most active company in the kernel development community. That is not to slight the company's work, of course; Red Hat still funds many of our most active developers, and those developers, in the subsystem-maintainer role, signed off on 16% of the changes merged this time around. But, at this point, Red Hat is one of a number of top-tier companies working to improve the Linux kernel. 

Speaking of signoffs, the most active developers and companies when it comes to signing off patches they did not write are:

The kernel's subsystem maintainers remain concentrated in relatively few companies though, arguably, they are spread out a bit more widely than they once were. While many companies are willing to support kernel development in specific areas, fewer of them see the need to support developers working in the subsystem-maintainer role. 

In summary, 4.4, the final kernel development for 2015, looks pretty typical. It was busier than most, but that, too, is typical, given the long-term trend toward larger development cycles. That busyness does not appear set to make this cycle longer than the 63 days that we have come to expect, though. Despite its occasional hiccups, the kernel-development machine continues to run smoothly.

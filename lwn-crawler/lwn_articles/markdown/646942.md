The [4.1-rc6](/Articles/646821/) prepatch is out, and things look on track for an on-schedule 4.1 release — unless, of course, [Linus's vacation plans](/Articles/645775/) get in the way. But the kernel development community doesn't stop, even when Linus does, so it seems like about time to have a look at some development statistics for this kernel cycle. 4.1 was a fairly typical development cycle with few surprises. 

With 11,664 changesets merged as of 4.1-rc6, this cycle is a little bit slower than most that have been seen in the last year, though it is significantly busier than 4.0, which finished with 10,346 changesets. The number of developers involved, at 1,492, comfortably exceeds 4.0; indeed, it currently ties 3.15 for the title of the most developers ever. Chances are good that, by the time it is released, the 4.1 kernel cycle will be the first to see the participation of over 1,500 developers. Of those over 1,500 developers, 270 have contributed their first patch ever in this cycle — a fairly typical number for recent years. 

Those developers have added 486,000 lines of code and removed 286,000 lines, for a net growth of 200,000 lines this time around. The most active developers doing this work were:

Hartley Sweeten no longer tops out the list with his Comedi driver work but, never fear, Ian Abbott contributed the most 4.1 changesets by working on, yes, the Comedi drivers. Remember, though, that Hartley contributed 463 Comedi changes in 3.19, so it may well be that work on this code is finally slowing down, though there doesn't appear to be a plan to move it out of the staging tree quite yet. Takashi Iwai is the sound subsystem maintainer, so most of his work concentrates in that area; for similar reasons, it is unsurprising that Hans Verkuil's changes were all found within the media subsystem and Marcel Holtmann's patches were applied to the Bluetooth code. Aya Mahfouz, instead, is an intern in the [Outreachy](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/) project's current round; she has clearly gotten off to a strong start with a lot of cleanup patches applied to staging drivers. 

On the "lines changed" side, Jie Yang's work was mostly a reorganization of the Intel audio driver code. Stephen Boyd removed some old ARM drivers, making him the developer having removed the most code in this development cycle. Sudip Mukherjee did a bunch of cleanupv work on a number of staging drivers, Chanwoo Choi worked mostly on the Samsung Exynos clock drivers, and Heiko Carstens removed a bunch of relatively obscure S/390 code — such as 31-bit support. 

There were (at least) 215 employers supporting work on the 4.1 kernel, the most active of which were:

As usual, there are few surprises here, with the possible exception of the 3.3% of the changesets contributed in this cycle by current and aspiring Outreachy interns. 

The `Signed-off-by` tags in a patch provide a picture of who handled the patch on its way into the appropriate subsystem maintainer's tree. In particular, if one looks at tags applied by developers other than the author of each patch, the result gives a view of who the gatekeepers are. For the 4.1 development cycle, the numbers look like this: 

> Most non-author signoffs in 4.1  
> ---  
> | By Developer  
> ---  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman| 1544| 13.8%  
> David S. Miller| 1067| 9.6%  
> Ingo Molnar| 407| 3.6%  
> Mark Brown| 405| 3.6%  
> Andrew Morton| 404| 3.6%  
> Daniel Vetter| 360| 3.2%  
> Mauro Carvalho Chehab| 342| 3.1%  
> Ralf Baechle| 263| 2.4%  
> Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo| 242| 2.2%  
> Kalle Valo| 210| 1.9%

> Linaro| 981| 8.8%  
> Google| 621| 5.6%

> IBM| 286| 2.6%  
  
While this development cycle is the result of the work of 1,500 developers and over 200 companies, at the subsystem maintainer level things are, as always, far more concentrated: over 60% of the changes going into this kernel passed through the hands of developers working for just five companies. This concentration reflects a simple fact: while many companies are willing to support developers working on specific tasks, the number of companies supporting subsystem maintainers is far smaller. Subsystem maintainership is also, increasingly, not a job for volunteer developers. 

And that is the story for the 4.1 development cycle. The kernel-development machine continues to hum along, integrating the work of thousands of developers and producing the kernels that run Linux systems worldwide. There are not many surprises to be seen here, but, for such an important piece of software, "not many surprises" is generally deemed to be a good thing.

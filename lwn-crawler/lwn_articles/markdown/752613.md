# Fixing error reporting—again [LWN.net]

After a
session
at last year's Linux
Storage, Filesystem, and Memory Management Summit (LSFMM), Jeff Layton was able to
make some improvements
to block-layer error
handling.  Those changes, which
added
a new
errseq_t
type to hold an error number and sequence number, seemed
to help and were well 
received—except
by the PostgreSQL
developers
.  So Layton led a session at the 2018 LSFMM to discuss ways
to improve things further; it would be followed later in the week with a
session by one of the PostgreSQL developers to look at the specifics of the
problem from their perspective.
Layton started by noting that Matthew Wilcox had come up with a
patch
to restore the
behavior that PostgreSQL relies on, which is to receive I/O errors from
periodic
fsync()
calls made by a checkpointing process. However,
that change still could not 
guarantee that errors would always be reported; if the inode is evicted
from memory, the error stored there will be lost.  The lack of a guarantee
made Layton leery of the patch, but Jan Kara noted that there never was a
guarantee, even under the old behavior prior to
errseq_t
.
A writeback error may not actually be reported by
fsync()
,
however; other calls, such as
close()
, could return it. 
There was some discussion about whether getting 
an error return from a
close()
call actually makes sense.  Dave
Chinner said that a write failure that is not noticed until well after the
write has completed (during writeback, for example) could be reported when
the file is closed.
But Layton mentioned Neil Brown's assertion that
returning errors on close is not reasonable.  For one thing, it is quite
common for applications to ignore the return code from
close()
.  But it is
documented that the
close()
call can return errors, so some
users will be dependent on
that
behavior, Chinner said.
Even with Wilcox's patch, there is still the problem of inodes that get
evicted from memory.  The bug has always been there but, since
error reporting is being scrutinized and fixed, it is worth eliminating that problem.
There was some talk of making the error persistent on 
disk, but Eric Sandeen suggested simply refusing to evict
inodes that have errors associated with them.
That should work well, and remove that lingering problem for PostgreSQL
(and others) unless there is major memory pressure, Layton said.  But
Chinner does not think hanging on to a few extra inodes is going to affect
the out-of-memory handling in any significant way.
Layton mentioned that  there is another problem:
syncfs()
is "really broken" in its error reporting.  He plans to fix that, probably
by using another
errseq_t
in the superblock, since reporting from
syncfs()
requires a
separate cursor on the error state.
As the session was wrapping up, Chinner asked about tests for the changes.
Layton said that he had some to add to xfstests, but there is a need to
create some specifically for the PostgreSQL
fsync()
problem.  That
will allow some assurance that the problem has really been solved and that it
doesn't regress down the road.

The 5.16 kernel was [released](/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgUkBrUVhjixy4wvrUhPbW-DTgtQubJWVOoLW=O0wRKMA@mail.gmail.com/) on January 9, as expected. This development cycle incorporated 14,190 changesets from 1,988 developers; it was thus quite a bit busier than [its predecessor](/Articles/874283/), and fairly typical for recent kernel releases in general. A new release means that the time has come to have a look at where those changes came from. 

The 1,998 developers contributing to 5.16 was the second-highest number ever, with only 5.13 (with 2,062 developers) being higher. This time around, 296 developers contributed their first change to the kernel, which is at the high end of the typical range. The most active developers in this cycle were:

The most prolific contributor of changesets for 5.16 was Michael Straube, who worked almost exclusively on the r8188eu wireless network adapter driver in the staging tree; that driver has now received 755 changes since being merged for the 5.15 release. Cai Huoqing contributed clean-up patches in many areas of the kernel, Jakub Kicinski made improvements throughout the networking subsystem, Christoph Hellwig continues his refactoring work in the block and filesystem layers, and Bart Van Assche reworked much of the SCSI subsystem code. 

In the lines-changed column, Ping-Ke Shih came out on top with the addition of the Realtek rtw89 driver; unlike many past Realtek drivers, this one skipped the staging tree and landed directly under `drivers/net`. Zhan Liu contributed exactly two patches adding yet another set of amdgpu header files. Nick Terrell updated the kernel's zstd compression module, Sameer Pujar added a set of NVIDIA Tegra sound drivers, and Johan Almbladh added eBPF JIT compilers for the 32- and 64-bit MIPS architectures. It's worth noting that there were relatively few large code removals in 5.16 (the biggest was the removal of Netlogic MIPS support by Thomas Bogendoerfer), so the kernel as a whole grew by 422,000 lines. 

The kernel project depends on its testers and reviewers as much as it depends on its developers. For the 5.16 cycle, the contributors with the most test and review credits were:

Once again, Daniel Wheeler heads the list of test credits, having received 15% of all such credits during the 5.16 development cycle. That is over two patches tested per day — every day, weekends and holidays included. Wheeler appears to be doing this work as part of his employer's internal review process, as do many of the other top testers. The top reviewers, instead, tend to be active developers who also manage to get a lot of reviews done. The top two reviewers for 5.16 are the same as for 5.15; Christoph Hellwig managed to review three patches and write two of his own for every day of the 70-day 5.16 development cycle. 

A different sort of review is associated with the task of selecting patches to apply and push into the mainline kernel. That decision may involve a thorough review in its own right, or it may rely on the review efforts of others. When maintainers accept patches, they will apply a Signed-off-by tag to those patches. By looking at signoffs by people other than the author of a patch, it is possible to get a picture for who the most active maintainers are. For 5.16 they were: 

> Top signoffs in 5.16  
> ---  
> David S. Miller | 1082| 7.8%  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman | 1062| 7.6%  
> Mark Brown | 558| 4.0%  
> Alex Deucher | 472| 3.4%  
> Jens Axboe | 442| 3.2%  
> Andrew Morton| 400| 2.9%  
> Martin K. Petersen | 353| 2.5%  
> Jakub Kicinski | 325| 2.3%  
> Mauro Carvalho Chehab | 325| 2.3%  
> Bjorn Andersson | 305| 2.2%  
> Paolo Bonzini | 230| 1.7%  
> Jonathan Cameron | 224| 1.6%  
> Kalle Valo | 210| 1.5%  
> Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo | 203| 1.5%  
> Hans Verkuil | 183| 1.3%  
> Felix Fietkau | 163| 1.2%  
> David Sterba | 162| 1.2%  
> Alexei Starovoitov | 154| 1.1%  
> Borislav Petkov | 152| 1.1%  
> Saeed Mahameed | 148| 1.1%  
  
This list of maintainers tends not to change much from one release to another; it is made up of some of the kernel project's most senior developers who have been on the job for many years. 

Work on 5.16 was supported by 251 employers that we were able to identify. The most active of those were:

This table, too, tends not to change much from one release to the next. For the curious, the "unknown" category consists of nearly 400 developers, most of whom contributed one or two patches. Any one of these developers is a small contributor to this release, but together they add up to a significant portion of the total patch flow. Many of those developers will move on, having done what they came to the kernel project to do; others are just getting started and will become significant contributors over time. 

In summary, 5.16 was just another typical kernel development cycle. Lots of patches from nearly 2,000 developers, all integrated into another solid (though not perfect) kernel release. The kernel project does not lack its share of problems with quality control, testing, support for maintainers, and more, but it nonetheless manages to get the work done on a predictable schedule. Work now begins on 5.17, which will be released in mid-March.

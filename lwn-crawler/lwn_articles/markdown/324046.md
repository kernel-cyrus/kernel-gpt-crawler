We are very much creatures of tradition here at LWN. So, as the 2.6.29 development cycle nears its end, tradition drives us to take a look at where the code came from in this development cycle. 

As of March 17, 11,610 non-merge changesets have been folded into the 2.6.29 kernel. These patches added an amazing 1,228,000 lines of code and documentation, while removing 401,000; the 2.6.29 kernel will have 827,000 more lines than its predecessor. Some ~~1420~~ 1166 developers took part in this cycle. Your editor, sensing that this number represents a record, decided to look back at previous kernels: 

> Release| Developers  
> ---|---  
> 2.6.22| 885  
> 2.6.23| 854  
> 2.6.24| 950  
> 2.6.25| 1124  
> 2.6.26| 1027  
> 2.6.27| 1022  
> 2.6.28| 1078  
> 2.6.29| 1166  
  
It would seem that there is a clear trend here: the kernel development community has grown significantly over the last couple of years. The number of employers represented by these developers (175) has grown a little, but the uncertainties involved in associating developers with employers argue against reading too much into that particular number. Suffice to say that quite a few companies are supporting kernel development work. 

Here are the individual developer statistics:

Chris Mason comes out on top of the "changesets" category as a result of the Btrfs merge. It is a significant body of code, to be sure, but the changeset count is as high as it is because the entire Btrfs development history was merged. So we're seeing rather more than three months worth of work there. Takasi Iwai did a great deal of work in the ALSA subsystem, and in the Intel HDA driver in particular. Jaswinder Singh Rajput contributed quite a few patches of the cleanup variety. Stephen Hemminger's work consisted mainly of changing the network driver API, then fixing a long list of broken drivers. And Michael Frysinger contributed a lot of changes to the Blackfin architecture. 

If one looks at the number of lines changed, the picture is a little different. As with 2.6.28, Greg Kroah-Hartman fed large amounts of crap (his word) into the -staging tree; that code does not retain the original author information within the git repository (though, of course, credits in the code itself are unchanged). Luis Rodriguez did a lot of work on Atheros wireless drivers and the cfg80211 subsystem; much of this work was associated with [regulatory compliance](http://lwn.net/Articles/294675/) support. Daniel Krueger achieved his place on the list by contributing a single patch: the Systec Electronic openPOWERLINK network stack. David Kiliani is another one-patch wonder; his was a driver for Meilhaus ME-IDS data collection cards. Daniel and David's patches both went into the -staging tree. So, three of the top five code contributors put their work in by way of -staging. 

The associated employer statistics look like this:

The employer numbers tend not to change radically from one release to the next; many of the same companies show up every time. New appearances this time include Vyatta (which supports Stephen Hemminger's work) and some companies (Simtec, SYS TEC, Cavium Networks) which contributed support for their own products. 

The number of patches with Reviewed-by tags remains relatively small - less than 5% of the total. The top credited reviewers this time around are: 

> Developers with the most reviews  
> ---  
> James Morris| 64| 20.2%  
> Dave Chinner| 51| 16.1%  
> Christoph Hellwig| 39| 12.3%  
> Andrew Morton| 14| 4.4%

These numbers remain an artifact of how the reporting of reviews is done; certainly there is more code review than this going on. The same is true for reporting and testing credits. For 2.6.29, the numbers are:

All told, 2.6.29 was one of the most active development cycles yet, with vast amounts of code finding its way into the kernel and a record number of developers participating. The development community might be justified in taking a rest after this much work, but the kernel process, it seems, never stops. There is already a lot of work waiting for the 2.6.30 merge window to open, at which point the whole cycle will start anew. 

(Thanks, as always, to Greg Kroah-Hartman for his help in assembling these statistics.)

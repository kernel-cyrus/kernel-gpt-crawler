The Linux Foundation has just published [a white paper](https://www.linux-foundation.org/publications/linuxkerneldevelopment.php), written by Greg Kroah-Hartman, Amanda McPherson, and your editor, reviewing the origins of the code merged into the kernel from 2.6.11 through 2.6.24. As LWN readers know, the 2.6.2**5** kernel is getting close to release. So this seems like as good a time as any to look at what happened with the process in this release cycle. 

As of this writing, 12,269 individual changesets have been merged for 2.6.25 - a new record. That beats the previous record (2.6.24, with a mere 10,353 changesets) by almost 2,000. There were 1,174 individual developers involved with 2.6.25, 419 of whom contributed one single patch. All told, those developers worked for 159 employers (that your editor could identify). The changes added 766,979 lines of code and removed 399,791, for a total growth of 367,188 lines. 

Here is an updated version of a plot that your editor has been fond of showing during talks in recent years: 

![\[Kernel lines-changed plot\]](https://static.lwn.net/images/ns/kernel/kernel-lcc-25.png)

This plot shows a cumulative count of lines changed over time, with kernel release dates added in. The effects of the merge window policy can be seen in the stair-step appearance of the plot. The steps appear to be getting bigger, but the time between releases has also increased slightly, so the overall rate of change remains roughly constant. It is a high rate, with over five million lines changed - well over half the total - in the last two years. 

So who did this work? Here is the traditional table of the most active developers in the 2.6.25 series: 

> Most active 2.6.25 developers  
> ---

> Kumar Gala| 19753| 2.2%  
> Paul Mundt| 18918| 2.1%  
> Jiri Slaby| 18002| 2.0%  
> Glenn Streiff| 16597| 1.8%  
> Auke Kok| 13939| 1.5%

> Patrick McHardy| 8563| 0.9%  
> Michael Krufky| 8195| 0.9%  
> Takashi Iwai| 7825| 0.9%  
  
There are some familiar names on this list, but also some new ones. Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz contributed more changesets than any other developer; his work is contained entirely within the IDE subsystem. Patrick McHardy works in the networking area, mostly (but not exclusively) with the netfilter subsystem. Adrian Bunk continues to make small fixes all over the tree and to relentlessly hunt down unused code for removal. Ingo Molnar remains busy in his new role as one of the x86 maintainers; scheduler work also accounts for a number of his changes. Paul Mundt maintains the SuperH architecture. 

The picture is a little different when one considers how many lines of code were changed. Jesper Nillson's work was done within the CRIS architecture. David Howells works all over the tree; his largest contribution was the addition of the MN10300 architecture code. Eliezer Tamir contributed the bnx2x (Broadcom Everest) network driver, and Kumar Gala works with the PowerPC architecture. 

There is relatively little change in the lists of employers associated with all of this work (please remember that the numbers associated with employers are necessarily approximate):

As usual, one can also look at who applies a Signed-off-by header to code for which they are not the author. These headers illustrate the chain of trust which gets code into the kernel. For 2.6.25, the top approvers of patches are:

Some of these developers are quite busy; Andrew Morton is signing off more than twenty patches every day - weekends included. The gatekeepers to the kernel continue to work for a relatively small number of companies, with the top ten employers accounting for over 75% of all non-author signoffs. 

All told, all these numbers paint a picture of a development process which is healthy and continues to set a fast pace. It incorporates work from an increasingly large community of developers who are able to work in a highly cooperative manner despite the fact that their employers are fierce competitors. There are very few projects like it.

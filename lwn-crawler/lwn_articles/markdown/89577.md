# Quote of the week [LWN.net]

This is all part of what responsible release management is about. I was the junior whiz kid in professional release management teams before starting Namesys. I listened to my elders and learned from them. My standards for professional conduct in this arena are higher than yours as a result of that. You are a bunch of young kids who lack professional experience in release management. That is ok, but don't get aggressive about it.

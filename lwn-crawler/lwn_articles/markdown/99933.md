# GmailFS - using Gmail as a filesystem [LWN.net]

Version 0.2 of [GmailFS](http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html) has been released. GmailFS is a fun hack which allows a Linux system to use a Gmail account as a remote storage device; it can be mounted as a normal (if, perhaps, slow) filesystem. It's a user-space filesystem written in Python.

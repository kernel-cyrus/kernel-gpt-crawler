As of this writing, the 2.6.39-rc7 prepatch has just been released and Linus has announced that it may be the last one before the final release. Being a traditional sort of operation, LWN.net would not let that release go by without looking at the statistics for this development cycle. It has been a busy cycle, but with some interesting changes. 

There have been just over 10,000 non-merge changesets merged for 2.6.39; with the sole exception of 2.6.37 (11,446 changesets), that's the highest since 2.6.33. Those changes came from 1,236 developers; only 2.6.37 (with 1,276 developers) has ever exceeded that number. Those developers added 670,000 lines of code while deleting 346,000 lines, for a net growth of 324,000 lines. The most active contributors this time around were:

Thomas Gleixner got to the top of the per-changesets list with a massive reworking of how interrupts are managed in the kernel - a job which required significant changes in almost every architecture. David Miller did a great deal of work cleaning up, reworking, and optimizing the networking stack. Mike McCormack did a lot of cleanup work on the rtl8192e driver in the staging tree, Mark Brown contributed the usual large pile of changes concentrated in the sound driver subsystem, and Tejun Heo improved things all over the tree, primarily in the x86 architecture code. 

On the lines-changed side, Wey-Yi Guy reworked some Intel network drivers, Wei Wang worked on the Realtek card reader driver in the staging tree, Alan Cox added the GMA500 driver to staging, Laurent Pinchart did a bunch of Video4Linux work including the addition of the [media controller subsystem](/Articles/415714/), and Guan Xuetao added the unicore32 architecture. 

There were just over 200 known employers supporting work on the 2.6.39, the most active of which were:

The percentage of changes coming from developers known to be working on their own time is at the lowest level seen since we started generating these statistics. Whether that means that volunteers are slowly losing interest in working with the kernel or that everybody who can do kernel work has been hired is hard to say. 

Red Hat, as always, generates large numbers of patches; Texas Instruments continues the steady increase we have seen over the last few years, while Oracle continues to decline. New entries this time around include Realsil (the Realtek card reader work), the Peking University Microprocessor R&D Laboratory (the unicore32 architecture), NetUP (various drivers), and the KFKI Research Institute (ipset). 

Occasionally it is interesting to look at the list of non-author signoffs - Signed-off-by tags added by developers who are not the authors of the patches involved. For 2.6.39, that list looks like this: 

> Developers with the most signoffs (total 8766)  
> ---  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman| 1162| 13.3%  
> David S. Miller| 546| 6.2%  
> John W. Linville| 437| 5.0%  
> Mauro Carvalho Chehab| 434| 5.0%

Greg Kroah-Hartman contributed "only" 69 patches to 2.6.39, but another 1,162 - over 13% of the total - passed through his hands on their way into the kernel. The bulk of those changes applied to the staging tree, but they were certainly not limited to staging. Linus Torvalds directly merged only 94 changes from others; everything else came in by way of a subsystem maintainer's tree. 

Despite being one of the more active development cycles in recent years, 2.6.39 has also been one of the smoothest. The number of difficult regressions has been small, and, if Linus's current plan holds, the cycle could complete in just over 60 days, which would make it the shortest development cycle since the beginning of the git era. Kernel development is not without its glitches, but the process would appear to be working quite smoothly. 

(As always, thanks are due to Greg Kroah-Hartman for his help in the creation of these statistics.)

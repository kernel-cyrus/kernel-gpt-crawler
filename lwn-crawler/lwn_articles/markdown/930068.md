As of this writing, nearly 7,500 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline repository for the 6.4 kernel release. The 6.4 merge window is thus clearly off and running, with a number of significant changes merged already. Read on for a summary of the most significant pulled so far. 

#### BPF

  * It is now possible to store kptrs in [more map types](https://git.kernel.org/linus/6c18e3753105) (specifically per-CPU hashmaps, LRU hashmaps, and local-storage maps). 
  * BPF programs can now use absolute time values in `bpf_timer_start()`. 
  * There are improved kptr types for use with packet and [XDP](/Articles/750845/) buffers. Other new kptr types include support for [RCU-protected kptrs](https://git.kernel.org/linus/20c09d92faee) and [reference-counted kptrs](https://git.kernel.org/linus/7a0788fe835f). 
  * Developers have added an [awareness](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b1d462bc30e7) of Android APK packages for uprobe programs. This makes it easier to attach uprobes to code stored in an APK package. 
  * The [generic iterators](/Articles/926041/) patch set has been merged, with the eventual goal of making it easier to write loops in BPF programs. 
  * The BPF verifier log, which contains vital information about why the verifier has rejected a program, can now be used in [a rotating mode](https://git.kernel.org/linus/255f0e14b9b0). This makes it more likely that the information actually needed by developers is still in the log when they look for it. 



#### Core kernel

  * There are two new [`ptrace()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html) operations — `PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_USER_DISPATCH` and `PTRACE_SET_SYSCALL_USER_DISPATCH` — which allow one process to manipulate the [system-call user dispatch](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/syscall-user-dispatch.html) settings of another. The target use case for this feature is the [Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace](https://criu.org/Main_Page) mechanism. 
  * The io_uring subsystem can perform multiple direct-I/O writes to a file in parallel if the underlying filesystem supports it; currently, ext4 and XFS have that support. There is also a new "multishot" timeout option that repeatedly generates timeouts without the need to re-arm the timer. 



#### Filesystems and block I/O

  * Calls to `open()` with both the `O_DIRECTORY` and `O_CREAT` flags [have strange semantics](/Articles/926782/) that have varied over the years. As of 6.4, this flag combination will simply cause the call to fail with an `EINVAL` error. 
  * The F2FS filesystem can now support zoned block devices where the sizes of the zones are not a power of two. 
  * The command codes for the [ublk driver](/Articles/903855/) have [changed](https://git.kernel.org/linus/2d786e66c966). This change will obviously break any programs using the old codes; for them, there is a configuration option (`UBLK_LEGACY_OPCODES`) that will cause the old codes to continue to work as well. 



#### Hardware support

  * **GPIO and pin control** : Loongson 64-bit GPIO controllers, Fairchild FXL6408 8-bit I2C-controlled GPIO expanders, and Intel Elkhart Lake PSE GPIO controllers. 
  * **Graphics** : Magnachip D53E6EA8966 DSI panels, Sony TD4353 JDI panels, Novatek NT36523 panels, Freescale i.MX LCD controllers, and Samsung MIPI DSIM bridges. 
  * **Hardware monitoring** : Starfive JH71x0 temperature sensors and ACBEL FSG032 power supplies. 
  * **Miscellaneous** : Qualcomm Cloud AI accelerators, Freescale i.MX8 image sensor interfaces, MSI laptop embedded controllers, Lenovo Yoga tablet-mode switches, Richtek RT5739 regulators, Richtek RT4803 boost regulators, and HiSilicon STB random-number generators 
  * **Networking** : Realtek RTL8710B(U) wireless interfaces, MediaTek MT7530 and MT7531 switches, STMicroelectronics STM32 basic extended CAN controllers, StarFive dwmac Ethernet controllers, AMD/Pensando core-device adapters, Realtek 8822BS, 8822CS, and 8821CS SDIO wireless network adapters, NXP 100BASE-TX PHYs, and Microchip 10BASE-T1S Ethernet PHYs. 



#### Miscellaneous

  * Noteworthy documentation additions include [the kernel contribution maturity model](https://git.kernel.org/linus/10a29eb658b3) and [a detailed tutorial](https://git.kernel.org/linus/efe920466f51) on how to build a trimmed kernel. 
  * The [nolibc library](/Articles/920158/) has gained loongarch support. 



#### Networking

  * The kernel now supports the [fair capacity](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4821a076eb60) and [weighted fair queuing](https://git.kernel.org/linus/42d452e7709f) stream schedulers for the SCTP protocol. 
  * There is now generic support for binding LEDs to network switches or PHYs in the system devicetree. 
  * There is a new, netlink-based API for calling out to user space for helper functions. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/3b3009ea8abb) for an overview of the functionality and [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/2fd5532044a8) to see how it is used to implement the TLS-handshake request. 
  * It is now possible to attach BPF programs to netfilter hooks, where they can make packet-forwarding decisions; [this merge commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d7a799ec782b) has some more information. 



#### Security-related

  * As expected, the [SELinux runtime disable feature](/Articles/927463/) has been removed. This feature has been deprecated for years, and most distributions have long since disabled it themselves, so chances are good that nobody will notice. 
  * The SELinux "checkreqprot" functionality, which could be used to circumvent policy restrictions on the creation of executable memory mappings, has also been removed. Here, too, there was a lengthy deprecation cycle and it seems unlikely that anybody will be affected. 
  * The kernel can now restrict the `.machine` keyring, which holds machine-owner keys, to keys that are properly signed by a recognized certificate authority. The intent is to allow this keyring to be used with the [Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)](https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/) subsystem. 



#### Internal kernel changes

  * There is a new, generalized mechanism to enable the creation of kernel worker processes from user space; see [this commit message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/3323ddce085c) for some more information. 
  * As [expected](/Articles/918344/), the SLOB memory allocator has been removed. 



Assuming that the usual two-week schedule holds, the 6.4 merge window can be expected to remain open until May 7. Once the window closes, you will of course find a summary here on LWN.

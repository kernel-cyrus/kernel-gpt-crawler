# Some 6.0 development statistics [LWN.net]

By **Jonathan Corbet**  
October 3, 2022 

Linus Torvalds [released the 6.0 kernel](/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wiaGf66EQOq1FwM6p9c3mGOjzm9stGeUTfC5Txx4yoxgg@mail.gmail.com/) on October 2. There were 15,402 non-merge changesets pulled into the mainline for this release, growing the kernel by just over 1.1 million lines of code. As usual, a lot went into the creation of this kernel release; read on for a look at where some of that work came from. 

A total of 2,034 developers contributed to the 6.0 release; of those, 236 made their first contribution during this cycle. The total number of developers is just short of the record (2,086) set for 5.19, but the number of first-time contributors is the lowest seen since the 5.6 release (216) in 2020. The most active contributors this time around were:

Sean Christopherson was the top contributor of commits this time around; every one of them was an improvement to the KVM subsystem. Krzysztof Kozlowski made a large number of devicetree changes. Johannes Berg has been working intensely on WiFi support, Charles Keepax did a lot of work in the sound subsystem, and Dmitry Baryshkov worked on a number of low-level (mostly Qualcomm) device drivers.

If one has, for some strange reason, a life goal of reaching the top of the "changed lines" column, pursuing a career working on AMD graphics drivers would be a wise course of action; both Aurabindo Pillai and Roman Li added yet more header files to the amdgpu driver. Oded Gabbay did something similar with the Habanalabs accelerator driver, while Zhengjun Xing updated the lists of Intel events for the `perf` tool.

Daniel Wheeler continues to be busy, testing nearly four patches per day, every day, during the 6.0 development cycle. The top reviewers were almost equally active. In total, 1,367 commits going into 6.0 (9.0% of the total) contained Tested-by tags, while 5,975 commits (39.1%) contained Reviewed-by tags. 

A total of 226 employers supported work on 6.0, down a bit from 5.19. The most active employers were:

As usual, surprises are hard to come by here, though it is amusing to note that just two companies are responsible for well over half of the lines of code changed in this cycle. 

#### Fixes in 6.0

Of the commits merged for 6.0, 2,781 contained "Fixes" tags indicating where a bug being fixed was first introduced. With a bit of scripting, it is possible to come up with a plot of the time-distribution of the bugs fixed in this development cycle. The result looks like this: 

> ![\[Fixes bar plot\]](https://static.lwn.net/images/2022/6.0-fixes.png)

Note that 6.0 also contains 719 commits with Fixes tags pointing to other 6.0 commits; those bugs never appeared in a mainline release, so that line has been left out. As was the case with 5.19, the picture shows that the bugs fixed in 6.0 were introduced all across the Git-era release history; only the 3.4, 2.6.24, 2.6.18, and 2.6.15 releases did not introduce bugs that were fixed in this cycle. The curious can peruse [the full list of fixes](/Articles/909882/) in 6.0. 

Looking at the plot, one might be tempted to wonder what happened in 2.6.35 that required 17 fixes in 6.0. The answer would appear to be a long list of terminal-driver fixes, all addressing problems introduced with the [n_gsm line discipline code](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e1eaea46bb40) merged in 2010. That commit is among the most-fixed in the entire kernel history, with no less than 70 patches addressing problems there. It just goes to show, one might conclude, that terminal drivers are so hard that even Alan Cox can't get them right. 

At the end of the 6.0 development cycle, one would expect any commits that claim to fix 6.0 bugs to have been merged as part of 6.0 — and, indeed, most of them are. Amusingly, though, the 5.19 kernel contained four commits fixing 6.0 bugs: 

  * [0326195f523a](https://git.kernel.org/linus/0326195f523a) (bpf: Make sure mac_header was set before using it) fixing [f9aefd6b2aa3](https://git.kernel.org/linus/f9aefd6b2aa3) (net: warn if mac header was not set) 
  * [07313a2b29ed](https://git.kernel.org/linus/07313a2b29ed) (mm: kfence: apply kmemleak_ignore_phys on early allocated pool) fixing [0c24e061196c](https://git.kernel.org/linus/0c24e061196c) (mm: kmemleak: add rbtree and store physical address for objects allocated with PA) 
  * [90f4b5499cdd](https://git.kernel.org/linus/90f4b5499cdd) (rtw88: 8821c: fix access const table of channel parameters) fixing [89d8f53ff6e7](https://git.kernel.org/linus/89d8f53ff6e7) (wifi: rtw88: Fix Sparse warning for rtw8821c_hw_spec) 
  * [84499c5d220a](https://git.kernel.org/linus/84499c5d220a) (drm/aperture: Run fbdev removal before internal helpers) fixing [f9aefd6b2aa3](https://git.kernel.org/linus/873eb3b11860) (fbdev: Disable sysfb device registration when removing conflicting FBs) 



Good kernel developers try to anticipate and avoid problems; it takes a truly great and prescient developer to write and submit the fix to a bug before that bug itself is merged. 

Doing great things is part of the kernel community's job description, though. The 6.1 development cycle is about to start as of this writing; there are currently just over 10,000 non-merge commits waiting in linux-next. That suggests that 6.1 may not be the busiest development cycle ever, but that kernel, which will be a long-term-support release, will still contain a lot of interesting work, including the expected merging of the [Rust-for-Linux](/Articles/908347/) and [multi-generational LRU](/Articles/894859/) patch sets. That release can be expected in mid-December; LWN will, of course, stay on top of what's happening throughout that development cycle.

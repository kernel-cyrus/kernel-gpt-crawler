If Linus Torvalds is to be believed, the final 4.10 kernel release will happen on February 12. This development cycle has been described as "quiet", but that term really only applies if one looks at it in comparison with [the record-setting 4.9 cycle](/Articles/708266/). As will be seen below, there was still quite a bit of activity in this "quiet" cycle; the kernel community is never truly quiet anymore, it would seem. 

As of this writing, 12,811 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline repository for the 4.10 development cycle. Those changes were contributed by 1,647 developers, of whom 251 made their first-ever contribution in 4.10. These numbers put this development cycle firmly in line with its predecessors: 

> Release | Changesets | Developers  
> ---|---|---  
> 4.0| 10,346| 1,458  
> 4.1| 11,916| 1,539  
> 4.2| 13,694| 1,591  
> 4.3| 11,894| 1,625  
> 4.4| 13,071| 1,575  
> 4.5| 12,080| 1,538  
> 4.6| 13,517| 1,678  
> 4.7| 12,283| 1,582  
> 4.8| 13,382| 1,597  
> 4.9| 16,214| 1,729  
> 4.10| 12,811| 1,647  
  
The trend toward increasing numbers of changesets clearly continues, with numbers that are now routinely higher than were seen even in the 4.0 kernel, less than two years ago. 

The most active developers this time around were:

Mauro Carvalho Chehab is the media subsystem maintainer, and much of his work this time around was focused there. He also, however, did a lot of work in the ongoing process of [converting the kernel's documentation to Sphinx](/Articles/692704/) and organizing it. Chris Wilson works on the Intel i915 driver, Arnd Bergmann made fixes all over the kernel tree, Christoph Hellwig contributed a lot of changes in the block and filesystem areas, and Ben Skeggs works on the Nouveau graphics driver. 

In the "changed lines" column, Andi Kleen ended up at the top of the list with a bunch of work in the perf events subsystem. Tom St. Denis added a bunch of code to the amdgpu driver, Edward Cree enhanced the sfc network driver, and Zhi Wang, once again, works in the i915 driver. 

These lists are often dominated by developers working in the staging tree but, this time, nobody in the top five of either list was creating staging patches. Indeed, Sergio Paracuellos is the first staging-focused developer in the left column, while no staging work features in the right column at all. The staging tree itself was busy enough, with 957 changes in 4.10, but that work was spread across 158 developers. 

Work on 4.10 was supported by 218 employers that can be identified. The list of the most active employers looks pretty much like it usually does: 

> Most active 4.10 employers

> Samsung| 545| 4.3%  
> Linaro| 496| 3.9%  
> SUSE| 471| 3.7%

Another way to look at the employer information is to see how many developers are associated with each company: 

> Companies with the most developers  
> ---  
> Company| Devs| Pct  
> (Unknown)| 349| 20.5%  
> Intel| 182| 10.7%  
> (None)| 103| 6.1%  
> Red Hat| 96| 5.6%  
> IBM| 66| 3.9%  
> Google| 53| 3.1%  
> Mellanox| 42| 2.5%  
> Linaro| 40| 2.4%  
> Samsung| 37| 2.2%  
> SUSE| 33| 1.9%  
> Texas Instruments| 28| 1.6%  
> AMD| 27| 1.6%  
> Oracle| 26| 1.5%  
> Code Aurora Forum| 26| 1.5%  
> Huawei Technologies| 25| 1.5%  
> NXP Semiconductors| 22| 1.3%  
> ARM| 21| 1.2%  
> Broadcom| 20| 1.2%  
> Renesas Electronics| 17| 1.0%  
> Rockchip| 15| 0.9%  
  
Here we see that nearly 11% of the developers who contributed to the 4.10 kernel were working for Intel. Over 20% were of unknown affiliation; they contributed 9.4% of the changes merged in this cycle. 

Normal practice in these summaries is to look at the "most active employers" table above and conclude that (in this case) if all of the unknowns are working on their own time, then a maximum of just over 15% of the changes in this development cycle came from volunteers. The above table paints a slightly different picture; if, once again, the unknowns are all volunteers, then nearly 27% of the community is made up of volunteers. The difference between the numbers is almost certainly explained by the unsurprising observation that developers doing kernel work for their job will be able to spend more time on that work and, as a result, be more productive. 

As of this writing, there are just over 7,500 changesets in the linux-next repository. Those changes are the beginning of what will be merged for 4.11; history suggests that this number is likely to grow significantly between now and the opening of the 4.11 merge window. Still, it seems clear that 4.11 is unlikely to set any new records for patch volume. For the definitive answer, look forward to the 4.11 summary article, to be published in 63-70 days.

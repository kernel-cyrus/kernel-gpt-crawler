# Bounding GPL compliance times [LWN.net]

A quick look at any development conference will reveal that quite a few Linux hackers are currently carrying phones made by HTC. They obviously like the hardware, but kernel developers have been getting increasingly [annoyed](/Articles/409864/) by HTC's policy of delaying source code releases for up to 120 days after a given handset ships. In response, Matthew Garrett has [suggested](/Articles/427114/) an addition to the top-level COPYING file in the kernel source: 

While this version of the GPL does not place an explicit timeframe upon fulfilment of source distribution under section 3(b), it is the consensus viewpoint of the Linux community that such distribution take place as soon as is practical and certainly no more than 14 days after a request is made. 

About the only response so far has been from [Alan Cox](/Articles/427115/), who has suggested that getting a lawyer's opinion on the matter might be useful. Linus, over whose name the new text would appear, has not commented on it. So it's not clear if the change will go in or whether it will inspire any changes in vendor behavior if it is merged. But it does, at least, make the developers' feelings on the matter known.

LWN is happy to host [an online version of _Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition_](/Kernel/LDD3/) by Jonathan Corbet, Alessandro Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. As of this writing, only the PDF version of the book is available; it will eventually be released in HTML and DocBook form as well. The book has been released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/), but you're going to want to run out and buy a copy or three anyway.

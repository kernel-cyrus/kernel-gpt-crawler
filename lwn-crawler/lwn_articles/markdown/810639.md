The [5.5 kernel](/Articles/810579/) was released on January 26. Over the course of this development cycle, it was occasionally said that the holidays were slowing contributions. At the end, though, 5.5 saw the merging of 14,350 non-merge changesets from 1,885 developers — not exactly a slow-moving cycle. Indeed, 5.5 just barely edged out 5.4 as the kernel with the most developers ever. Read on for our traditional look at where the contributions to 5.5 came from, along with a digression into the stable-update process. 

Just under 590,000 lines of code were added for 5.5, while almost 272,000 were removed, for a net growth of 318,000 lines of code. Of the developers contributing to 5.5, 285 were contributing for the first time. The most active developers working on 5.5 were:

One of the most reliable ways to get into the list of top contributors, it seems, is to work on a graphics driver; it is thus not surprising that Chris Wilson contributed the most changesets entirely through work on the Intel i915 driver. Christoph Hellwig did a lot of work in the XFS filesystem, the block layer, and the RISC-V architecture code. Yue Haibing and Colin Ian King both contributed cleanup patches all over the tree, while Thierry Reding worked mostly on the Tegra graphics driver. 

In the "lines changed" column, Ard Biesheuvel worked almost entirely in the crypto subsystem; much of that work was aimed at enabling the merging of the WireGuard VPN code into 5.6. Haiyan Song contributed exactly two patches updating perf events data for Intel CPUs. Dmitry Osipenko worked on Tegra hardware support, and Hao Zheng contributed one big patch to the Marvell octeontx2 network driver. 

The testing and reviewing numbers this time around look like this:

Only 797 changesets (5.5% of the total) carried Tested-by tags, while 4,939 changesets (34% of the total) had Reviewed-by tags. Two of the top testers, Andrew Bowers and Keerthy focus on testing Intel and TI-specific driver patches, respectively. The top reviewer, Darrick Wong, applied the Reviewed-by tag to XFS patches that, as the XFS maintainer, he also signed off on; most other subsystem maintainers do not follow that practice. 

The most prolific bug reporters (and those who credited them) in this cycle were:

These numbers would indicate that over 1/3 of the bug reports for the kernel (of which 934 were credited in 5.5) are now coming from automated testing systems. Some of the reported bugs are more severe than others, but there is little doubt that having automated systems finding hundreds of bugs (that are subsequently fixed) each development cycle is good for the kernel as a whole.

The employer table is generally unsurprising, and this month is no exception. 

#### A walk on the stable side

The 4.9 kernel was released on December 11, 2016, just over three years ago. Some 16,214 non-merge changesets went into the 4.9 release. Since then, as of this writing, there have been 210 stable updates to 4.9, adding another 15,210 changesets — enough to make up another large development cycle. That is a lot of fixes, and they are not all small: 4.9.210 is 80,000 lines larger than 4.9 was. 

The contributor picture for this long-term stable kernel is somewhat different than [it was at release time](/Articles/708266/). The following are the most active contributors to the updates — the releases that came out after 4.9:

Greg Kroah-Hartman's position at the top of the individual list is a bit deceptive; over 200 of those commits are simply setting the version numbers for each stable release. Of the remaining commits, 50 are reverts of "stable" changes that proved to be not such a good idea. Take those commits out, and he would not have made it into the top 20 changeset contributors. 

The picture that emerges in general is one containing many long-term contributors to the core kernel; they may not be the top contributors from one release to the next, but they are creating the important fixes that we all depend on. 

Only 2,775 of the fixes merged between 4.9 and 4.9.210 contain a Reported-by tag; that is about 18% of the total. Given that most of the commits in this series are meant to be bug fixes, that suggests that a lot of bug reports are still going without credit. The reporters who _were_ credited for fixes going into 4.9.x were: 

> Top 4.9.x bug reporters  
> ---  
> Syzbot| 471  
> Dmitry Vyukov| 98  
> Andrey Konovalov| 79  
> Dan Carpenter| 52  
> kbuild test robot| 32  
> Hulk Robot| 30  
> Fengguang Wu| 26  
> Jianlin Shi| 26  
> Ben Hutchings| 24  
> Jann Horn| 23  
> Al Viro| 18  
> Guenter Roeck| 18  
> Wen Xu| 17  
> Arnd Bergmann| 14  
> Eric Biggers| 14  
> Anatoly Trosinenko| 11  
> Alexander Potapenko| 10  
> Li Shuang| 10  
> Eric Dumazet| 9  
> Tetsuo Handa| 9  
> Pali Rohár| 9  
  
Bearing in mind that Syzbot and Dmitry Vyukov are one and the same in this context, it is clear that the Syzbot robot, in particular, has been highly effective in finding bugs that have been in the kernel for a long time. The same is true, to a lesser degree, for Fengguang Wu and his "kbuild test robot". 

The process of developing and stabilizing a kernel clearly does not abruptly end the day that Linus Torvalds releases it; one might argue that much of the real work has just begun. Getting developers to focus on fixing bugs rather than developing new ones has been a struggle for almost as long as there has been software; the good news is that, over the years, the development community has gotten better at doing that work. The development process now continues at a high speed, even after a new kernel is released and the focus moves on to the next development cycle.

Linus Torvalds [released](/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whCKhxNyKn1Arut8xUDKTwp3fWcCj_jbL5dbzkUmo45gQ@mail.gmail.com/) the 5.10 kernel on December 13 at the end of a typical nine-week development cycle. At that point, 16,174 non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline; that makes 5.10 a larger cycle than 5.9, but it falls just short of the record set by 5.8, which ended with 16,308 changesets. For the most part 5.10 is just another routine kernel release, but there are a couple of interesting things to be seen in the overall statistics. 

A total of 1,971 developers contributed to 5.10 — again, just short of the record set by 5.8. Of those developers, 252 (just under 13%) made their first contribution in 5.10; that is the lowest number seen since 5.6. The most active 5.10 developers were:

The author contributing the most changesets to 5.10 was Krzysztof Kozlowski, who made cleanups and small improvements all over the Arm and driver subsystems — at a rate of almost eight per day, seven days per week. Mauro Carvalho Chehab did a lot of work across the media, documentation, and staging subsystems. Christoph Hellwig's work included significant rewrites across the filesystem and block layers, along with the [`set_fs()` removal](/Articles/832121/). Pierre-Louis Bossart did a lot of work in the sound subsystem, and Lee Jones contributed a large number of warning fixes. 

Sudeep Dutt contributed [a single patch](https://git.kernel.org/linus/80ade22c06ca) to 5.10, but that patch removed the drivers for Intel "many integrated core" (MIC) devices, deleting enough code to land at the top of the "lines changed" column. Corentin Labbe resurrected the [Zoran MJPEG capture driver](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/media/v4l-drivers/zoran.html) in the staging tree, and Fabio Estevam removed a bunch of old Arm board files.

The top three testers show an interesting pattern: their Tested-by tags all appear together on the same patches, all targeting the vc4 DRM driver. On the report side, we see that nearly 38% of all credited bug reports come from automated testing systems. Note that, since these tags appear in patches, they indicate reports that actually resulted in some sort of fix; that is a lot of bugs that won't be around to affect users later on. 

A total of 228 companies (that we know of) supported work on the 5.10 kernel, an increase relative to recent past releases. The companies supporting the most work were:

The presence of Huawei at the top of the "by changesets" column may be a bit of a surprise, though something similar [happened in 5.8](/Articles/827735/). As was the case then, Chehab's work obviously helped to drive that number, but it was also the result of 94 other developers working for Huawei who contributed at least one patch to 5.10. Huawei has built up a significant kernel-development operation. Beyond that, these results are mostly as one would expect. 

Another difference in this cycle can be seen by looking at the non-author signoffs in the merged commits. Applying a Signed-off-by tag to a patch that one did not write is usually done by maintainers who are applying patches to be sent upstream; looking at these signoffs thus give an indication of who the gatekeepers to the kernel are. For 5.10, the results look like this:

Seeing David Miller, the maintainer of the networking subsystem, at the top of this list is traditional, and he occupies this position for 5.10 as well. Miller, unfortunately, abruptly dropped out of the kernel community just after the 5.9 release due to [a health issue](/Articles/834026/), so this table reflects his work done prior to the 5.10 merge window. After that, Jakub Kicinski took over networking maintenance, which explains his appearance on the list (and Facebook's relatively high position). This change will be more strongly felt in the 5.11 release; Kicinski currently has signed off nearly 900 patches in linux-next. 

Happily, Miller is recovering and has started applying networking patches again. Meanwhile, this episode turned into an unplanned test of the community's response when one of its most active maintainers is no longer able to do that work. That response appears to have gone well, with the flow of networking patches into the mainline and linux-next continuing at a strong pace. There appears to have been little disruption in the networking community overall. 

It would be nice to believe that all important kernel subsystems are as well prepared for an abrupt maintainer change, but that is almost certainly not the case. So the kernel community might not pass the next test in such good form. That said, the numbers this time around show that kernel development is still going strong; kernels are released on a predictable schedule, participation across the community is high, and there are still numerous new developers making their debut in each release. 2020 was a difficult year, but the kernel community has gotten through it with, it seems, relatively little trouble.

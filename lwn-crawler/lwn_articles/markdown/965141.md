As of this writing, just over 4,900 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline for the 6.9 release. This work includes the usual array of changes all over the kernel tree; read on for a summary of the most significant work merged during the first part of the 6.9 merge window.   


#### Architecture-specific

  * Support for the Intel [Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/779982/flexible-return-and-event-delivery-fred-specification.html) mechanism has been merged. FRED improves low-level event delivery, allowing for simpler and more reliable code; see [this changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/720c85790753) and [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/51383e741b41) for more information. 
  * The core kernel has gained support for running AMD [Secure Nested Paging](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/epyc-business-docs/white-papers/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf) (SNP) guests, part of AMD's confidential-computing solution. Full support requires KVM changes which, evidently, have been deferred until 6.10. 
  * The kernel can now make use of GCC's [named address spaces](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Named-Address-Spaces.html) feature to optimize access to per-CPU data. 
  * The latest x86 hardware vulnerability is "register file data sampling", which affects Intel Atom CPUs. The mitigations have been merged; see [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4e42765d1be0) for details. 



#### Core kernel

  * The kernel is now able to create and use pidfds with threads, rather than just the thread-group leader. This feature can be accessed using the new `PIDFD_THREAD` flag with [`pidfd_open()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_open.2.html) or `CLONE_THREAD` with [`clone()` or `clone3()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html). The semantics of thread-level pidfds varies a bit from process pidfds; see [this merge changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b5683a37c881) for details. 
  * There is a new kernel virtual filesystem for pidfds; see [this article](/Articles/963749/) for details. 
  * The [BPF arena subsystem](/Articles/961941/), which manages shared memory between BPF programs and user space, has been merged. To support use of this memory, the [`cond_break` macro](/Articles/964381/) changes have been merged as well. 



#### Filesystems and block I/O

  * The zonefs and hugetlbfs filesystems now support [ID-mapped mounts](/Articles/896255/). 
  * The new `RWF_NOAPPEND` flag for [`pwritev2()`](/Articles/670231/) allows an offset to be supplied for the write even if the file has been opened in append-only mode. This flag makes `pwritev2()` behave as POSIX had intended with `pwritev()`. 
  * The old ntfs filesystem implementation has been removed in favor of ntfs3. 
  * The new `FS_IOC_GETUUID` [`ioctl()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html) command will retrieve the UUID for a given filesystem; it is a generic version of the (previously) ext4-only feature. Another new command, `FS_IOC_GETFSSYSFSPATH`, will retrieve the location for a mounted filesystem under `/sys/fs`. 
  * The [io_uring](/Articles/776703/) subsystem has gained the ability to truncate a file. 
  * Administrators of NFSv4 servers now have the ability to revoke open and lock states on files. 



#### Hardware support

  * **Miscellaneous** : StarFive JH8100 external interrupt controllers. 
  * **Networking** : RENESAS FemtoClock3 PTP clocks, Qualcomm QCA807x PHYs, Marvell Octeon PCI Endpoint NICs, esd electronics gmbh CAN-PCI(e)/402 controllers, and Freescale QUICC multichannel controllers. 



#### Miscellaneous

  * The kernel now uses version 1.76.0 of the Rust language. This update stabilizes two features (`const_maybe_uninit_zeroed` and ~~`ptr_metadata`~~ `byte_sub`, which can replace the unstable `ptr_metadata`) used by the kernel, making the list of needed unstable features that much shorter. There have been various other Rust-related changes as well; see [this merge changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/8ede842f669b) for details. 
  * Anybody interested in the details of how to use bisection to track down a kernel regression may want to have a look at [this new document](https://git.kernel.org/linus/781296727646) that covers the topic extensively. 



#### Networking

  * There has been a lot of work done to reduce the use of the networking subsystem's core RTNL lock and reduce contention overall. 



#### Security-related

  * The [BPF token mechanism](/Articles/947173/), which allows the delegation of fine-grained permissions for BPF operations, has been merged. This merge was attempted for 6.8 but ended up being reverted; this time it seems likely to stick. [This changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/c8632acf193b) gives an overview of the current state of this work. 



#### Internal kernel changes

  * The [BH workqueue mechanism](/Articles/960041/), intended as an eventual replacement for tasklets, has been merged. 
  * The timer subsystem has been [extensively reworked](/Articles/913568/) to better choose the CPU on which an expired timer runs. See [this merge changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d08c407f715f) for some more information about this change. 
  * The UBSAN signed-overflow sanitizer has been restored with the idea of helping to drive compiler development toward better [signed wraparound](/Articles/959189/) warnings. 



The 6.9 merge window can be expected to remain open through March 24. There is still a lot of work waiting to be pulled into the mainline; as usual, that work will be summarized here once the merge window closes.

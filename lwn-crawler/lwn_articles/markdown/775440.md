This year's holiday gifts will include the 4.20 kernel; that can only mean that it is time for another look at where the code going into this release has come from. This development cycle was typically busy and brought a lot of new code into the kernel. There are some new faces showing up in the statistics this time around, but not a lot of surprises otherwise. 

As of this writing, 13,856 non-merge changesets have found their way into the mainline repository for the 4.20 release; they were contributed by 1,743 developers. That makes 4.20 the busiest cycle since 4.15, but only by a little bit; both numbers are essentially in line with recent release history. Of those 1,743 developers, 283 were first-time contributors this time around. The most active 4.20 contributors were:

Lorenzo Bianconi reached the top of the "by changesets" column with a long set of changes to the mt76 network driver. Christoph Hellwig did a bunch of work in the block subsystem, as well as some significant improvements to the DMA mapping layer. Laurent Pinchart worked mostly with graphics drivers, Yue Haibing did a lot of cleanup work in various device drivers, and Paul McKenney worked mostly in the read-copy-update subsystem. 

As is often the case, the "changed lines" column was dominated by changes to the AMD graphics drivers; Feifei Xu landed at the top with 15 patches adding more header files for those drivers. Spencer Olson made a bunch of improvements to the comedi drivers in the staging subsystem, Hannes Reinecke replaced the DAC960 driver with a reimplemented version, Guo Ren added the C-SKY architecture, and Ard Biesheuvel did a bunch of core work in the crypto subsystem, the jump label mechanism, and the Arm architecture. 

Reviewing and testing patches are important parts of the development process. The most active reviewers and testers this time around were:

Of the nearly 14,000 changes in 4.20, 953 (just under 7%) had Tested-by tags, while 4,198 (30%) had Reviewed-by tags. 

Work on 4.20 was supported by 223 companies that we know of; the most active of those companies were:

As usual, there are few surprises here; while many companies contribute to the kernel, the list of those doing the most work tends to be restricted to a fairly small number of them. It is worth noting that, of the 283 first-time contributors seen during this development cycle, 17 were working at Intel as of their first commit, while 13 were at the Code Aurora Forum, 12 at AMD, and 10 at Google. All told, over half of the first-time contributors were already affiliated with a company. 

If one looks only at the 1,339 patches touching core kernel code (loosely defined as the contents of the `fs`, `kernel`, and `mm` directory trees), the results come out a bit different:

There are a lot of companies that find it in their interest to support work on the Linux kernel, but rather fewer of them put resources into the core code that everybody uses. 

Contributions all over the kernel tree are the fuel that keeps this project going, though. Once again, it would appear that, despite whatever problems the community may have, the kernel-development machine continues to run smoothly, integrating vast amounts of work into a new release every nine or ten weeks.

Just over 7,500 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline repository since the opening of the 5.8 merge window â€” not a small amount of work for just four days. The early pulls are dominated by the networking and graphics trees, but there is a lot of other material in there as well. Read on for a summary of what entered the kernel in the first part of this development cycle. 

#### Architecture-specific

  * Branch-target identification and shadow call stacks (both described in [this article](/Articles/804982/)) have been added to the Arm64 architecture. Both are hardening technologies that, with luck, will make Arm64 systems more resistant to attack. The shadow call stack support is likely to spread to other architectures in the near future. 



#### Core kernel

  * The new `faccessat2()` system call adds the flags argument that POSIX has always said should be there. The current support for [`faccessat()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/faccessat.2.html) on Linux systems depends on emulation of the flags argument by the C library; `faccessat2()` will allow a better implementation in the kernel. 
  * Memory control groups have a new knob, `memory.swap.high`, which can be used to slow down tasks that are using large amounts of swap space; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4b82ab4f2883) for a bit more information. 
  * The io_uring subsystem now supports the [`tee()` system call](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/tee.2.html). 
  * It is now possible to pass a [pidfd](/Articles/794707/) to the [`setns()` system call](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html); in that case, it is possible to specify multiple namespace types. The calling process will be moved to all of the applicable namespaces in an atomic manner. 
  * The "BPF iterator" mechanism, which facilitates the dumping of kernel data structures to user space, has been merged; this feature was covered in [this article](/Articles/818714/) in April. 
  * There is a new ring buffer for communicating data from BPF programs. It is intended to resemble the perf ring buffer while allowing sharing of the buffer across multiple CPUs. See [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/97abb2b39682) for more information. 
  * The [padata mechanism](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/padata.html) now supports multi-threaded jobs with load balancing; see [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/ec3b39c73189) for details. 
  * The kernel's `swappiness` tuning knob, which sets the balance between reclaiming file-backed and anonymous pages, has traditionally been used to bias the system away from swapping anonymous pages. With fast I/O devices, though, swapping may be faster than filesystem access, so it may be useful to bias the system toward swapping. Now `swappiness` can take values up to 200 to push things in that direction; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/c843966c556d) for details. 



#### Filesystems and block I/O

  * Low-level support for [inline encryption](/Articles/797309/) has been added to the block layer. Inline encryption is a hardware feature that encrypts (and decrypts) data moving between a block storage device and the CPU using a key provided by the CPU. Some more information can be found in [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/54b259f68de5). 
  * There is a new [`statx()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html) flag (`STATX_ATTR_DAX`) that indicates that the file in question is being accessed directly via the DAX mechanism. There is also [a documentation patch](https://git.kernel.org/linus/83d9088659e8) that attempts to specify just how filesystems will behave when DAX is in use. More DAX-related changes can be expected during this merge window. 



#### Hardware support

  * **Graphics** : Leadtek LTK050H3146W panels, Northwest Logic MIPI DSI host controllers, Chrontel CH7033 video encoders, Visionox RM69299 panels, and ASUS Z00T TM5P5 NT35596 panels. 
  * **Hardware monitoring** : Maxim MAX16601 voltage regulators, AMD RAPL MSR-based energy sensors, Gateworks System Controller analog-to-digital converters, and Baikal-T1 process, voltage, and temperature sensors. 
  * **Interrupt control** : Loongson3 HyperTransport interrupt vector controllers, Loongson PCH programmable interrupt controllers, and Loongson PCH MSI controllers. 
  * **Media** : Rockchip video decoders and OmniVision OV2740 sensors. The "atomisp" driver has also been resurrected in the staging tree and seen vast amounts of cleanup work. 
  * **Miscellaneous** : AMD SPI controllers, Maxim 77826 regulators, Arm CryptoCell true random number generators, Amlogic Meson SDHC host controllers, Freescale eSDHC ColdFire controllers, and Loongson PCI controllers, 
  * **Networking** : Broadcom BCM54140 PHYs, Qualcomm IPQ4019 MDIO interfaces, MediaTek STAR Ethernet MACs, Realtek 8723DE PCI wireless network adapters, and MediaTek MT7915E wireless interfaces. 



#### Miscellaneous

  * The new `initrdmem=` boot-time option specifies an initial disk image found in RAM; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/694cfd87b0c8) for more information. 



#### Networking

  * The bridge code now supports the [media redundancy protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Redundancy_Protocol), where a ring of Ethernet switches can be used to survive single-unit failures. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/45c9cbec425c) for more information. 
  * The new "gate" action for the traffic-control subsystem allows specific packets to be passed into the system during specified time slots. This action is naturally undocumented, but some information can be found in [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a51c328df310). 
  * Some network devices can perform testing of attached network cables; the kernel and `ethtool` utility now support that functionality when it is available. 
  * The [multiprotocol label switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching) routing algorithm is now available for IPv6 as well as IPv4. 
  * [RFC 8229](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8229), which describes encapsulation of key-exchange and IPSec packets, is now supported. 



#### Security-related

  * The [`CAP_PERFMON` capability](/Articles/812719/) has been added; a process with this capability can do performance monitoring with the perf events subsystem. 
  * The new `CAP_BPF` capability covers some BPF operations that previously required `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. In general, most BPF operations will also require either `CAP_PERFMON` (for tracing and such) or `CAP_NET_ADMIN`; [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a17b53c4a4b5) gives a terse overview of which operations require which capabilities. 



#### Internal kernel changes

  * The "pstore" mechanism, which stashes away system-state information in case of a panic, has gained a new back-end that stores data to a block device. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/649304c936cd) for documentation. 
  * There is a new read-copy-update (RCU) variant called "RCU rude"; it delineates grace periods only at context switches. Those wondering about the name might see the comment in [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/c84aad765406), which reads: ""It forces IPIs and context switches on all online CPUs, including idle ones, so use with caution"". 
  * The [RCU-tasks](/Articles/607117/) subsystem has a new "RCU tasks trace" variant suited to the needs of tracing and BPF programs; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d5f177d35c24) for details. 
  * "Local locks" have been brought over from the realtime preemption tree. These locks are intended to replace code that disables preemption and/or interrupts on a single processor. Advantages include a better realtime implementation and the ability to properly instrument locking; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/91710728d172) for more information. 
  * The API for managing file readahead has changed significantly; see [this patch series](/ml/linux-kernel/20200414150233.24495-1-willy@infradead.org/) for details. 
  * The `kgdb` kernel debugger is now able to work with the boot console, enabling debugging much earlier in the boot process; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/220995622da5) and [this documentation patch](https://git.kernel.org/linus/f71fc3bc7b32) for more information. 
  * There is a new buffer-allocation API intended to make the writing of XDP network drivers easier. Documentation is too much to hope for, but the API can be seen in [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/2b43470add8c). 



The 5.8 merge window can be expected to remain open until June 14; after that, the actual 5.8 release should happen in early August. Stay tuned; LWN will provide an update on the rest of this merge window after it closes.

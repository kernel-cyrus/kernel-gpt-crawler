# The 2.6.23 merge window opens [LWN.net]

Linus opened the 2.6.23 merge window with a bang: the first thing merged was the [CFS CPU scheduler](http://lwn.net/Articles/230574/). The [group scheduling feature](http://lwn.net/Articles/240474/) is not available, however, since it depends on the [generic process containers](http://lwn.net/Articles/236038/) patch, and would appear that containers will have to wait another cycle. 

Other patches merged so far include an IDE update, the rtl8187 wireless network driver (the first driver to use the mac80211 stack), support for the Yukon EX (88e8071) network adapter chipset, Xbox 360 gamepad support, a big rework of the `splice()` code which replaces `sendfile()` and adds an internal `vmsplice_to_user()` feature, an LZ01X compression implementation, and the removal of a number of ancient CDROM drivers. 

The 2.6.23 process has barely begun, expect a great deal of work to be merged yet. Andrew Morton's [2.6.23 merge plan](/Articles/241265/) is useful reading for those who would like to know what else may go in; among other things, it looks like this kernel will include [`fallocate()`](http://lwn.net/Articles/240571/), [lguest](http://lwn.net/Articles/218766/), and the [on-demand readahead](http://lwn.net/Articles/235164/) patches. Bear in mind that much of what goes into 2.6.23 will not get there by way of Andrew, so this is far from a complete list of what this kernel will contain.

# Who wrote 2.6.38 [LWN.net]

As of this writing, the 2.6.38 development cycle has reached the 2.6.38-rc6 prepatch and things are beginning to settle down a little. One or two more testing releases can be expected before the final release, but we are close enough to the final shape of 2.6.38 that a look at where the code came from this time around makes sense. While this cycle has been a bit less busy than its predecessor, 2.6.38 still shows an active and engaged development community. 

The 2.6.38 cycle has seen 9,148 non-merge changesets from 1,136 developers (again, as of this writing). Compared to 2.6.37 (11,446 changesets from 1,276 developers) those numbers may seem small, but they are on a par with most other recent kernel releases: 

> Release| Changes| Devs  
> ---|---|---  
> 2.6.34| 9,443| 1,151  
> 2.6.35| 9,801| 1,188  
> 2.6.36| 9,501| 1,176  
> 2.6.37| 11,446| 1,276  
> 2.6.38| 9,148| 1,136  
  
603,000 lines of code were added in this cycle, and 312,000 were removed, for a net growth of 291,000 lines of code. The most active contributors of that code were:

Joe Perches made it to the top of the "by changesets" with a long list of patches removing excess semicolons and casts, adding "`static`" keywords, and other things of that nature. Chris Wilson's changes were entirely in the Intel graphics driver subsystem, Russell King remains active as the lead ARM maintainer, Mark Brown does large amounts of work in the sound driver subsystem, and Tejun Heo had patches all over the tree, most of which are related to cleaning up workqueue usage.

Vladislav Zolotarov's path to the top of the "lines changed" column ostensibly should not exist anymore; among his many bnx2x driver changes was a large firmware replacement. Nicholas Bellinger is the main author of the LIO SCSI target patches which were merged, after extensive discussion, for 2.6.38. Larry Finger added the Realtek RTL8192CE/RTL8188SE wireless network adapter to the staging tree, Hans Verkuil continues his work straightening out the Video4Linux2 subsystem, and Barry Song added a number of IIO drivers to the staging tree. 

Work on 2.6.38 was supported by a minimum of 180 employers, the most active of whom were:

The most significant new entry is Rising Tide Systems, a storage array company which, unsurprisingly, has an interest in the kernel's SCSI target implementation. Otherwise, the entries at the top of the table have changed little over the last few years; here is a plot showing the trends since 2.6.28:

There is a certain amount of noise, but, over this entire period, non-paid contributors are at the top of the list, followed by Red Hat and Intel, in that order. The most significant trends, perhaps, are TI's steady increase over time, and IBM's slow decline. 

Regardless of what individual companies do, though, the real picture that emerges from this data is that the kernel development process remains strong and active. The rate of change remains high, and the community from which those changes come remains large and diverse. There may come a time when the kernel community runs out of ideas and things to do, but it does not seem that things will slow down anytime soon.

The 5.15 kernel was [released](/Articles/874495/) on October 31, with the code name appropriately changed to "Trick or Treat". By that time, 12,377 non-merge changesets had been merged into the mainline, adding a net total of 332,000 lines of code. Read on for a look at where the contributions to the 5.15 kernel came from. 

Long-time readers of these summaries will note that the changeset total for 5.15 is relatively low; indeed, it's worth comparing it to the kernel's release history since 5.0 came out in early 2019: 

> Release| Changesets| Developers  
> ---|---|---  
> 5.0 | 12,808 | 1,712  
> 5.1 | 13,034 | 1,707  
> 5.2 | 14,024 | 1,716  
> 5.3 | 14,605 | 1,846  
> 5.4 | 14,619 | 1,802  
> 5.5 | 14,350 | 1,885  
> 5.6 | 12,665 | 1,712  
> 5.7 | 13,901 | 1,878  
> 5.8 | 16,306 | 1,991  
> 5.9 | 14,858 | 1,914  
> 5.10 | 16,308 | 1,971  
> 5.11 | 14,340 | 1,912  
> 5.12 | 13,015 | 1,873  
> 5.13 | 16,030 | 2,062  
> 5.14 | 14,735 | 1,912  
> 5.15 | 12,377 | 1,797  
  
As can be seen, 5.15 is, with regard to changesets merged, the quietest development cycle we have seen in the 5.x era. Indeed, one needs to go back to [the 4.7 release](/Articles/695993/) in August 2016, which had 12,283 changesets from 1,582 developers, to find a quieter one. The relative slowness of this cycle is especially interesting considering that 5.15 will almost certainly be the next long-term support release. Kernel developers have often worried about vendors trying to shove unready code in for LTS releases, but there is little evidence of that happening here. 

Instead, perhaps, the development community is just taking a well-deserved mid-pandemic break. 

#### Individual contributors

Meanwhile, the number of developers participating in this release, while down from recent cycles, is higher than for some others in the 5.x era. Of the 1797 developers contributing to 5.15, 251 did so for the first time; that _is_ a relatively low number but not out of line with previous releases. The most active developers in this cycle were:

Christoph Hellwig was the top contributor of changesets this time around; he continues his extensive refactoring of code in the block and SCSI subsystems, with occasional side trips to, for example, [remove `set_fs()`](/Articles/832121/) from the m68k architecture. Namjae Jeon contributed the new ksmbd filesystem implementation, Takashi Iwai continued his work as the sound subsystem maintainer, Vladimir Oltean contributed a lot of network-driver improvements, and Colin Ian King did minor cleanups throughout the kernel tree. 

The developer with the most changed lines this time around was Phillip Potter, who added the rt8818eu wireless network driver. Konstantin Komarov contributed the ntfs3 filesystem driver, and Jin Yao added perf events support for a number of newer Intel subarchitectures. 

The kernel project depends on its testers and reviewers as much as it depends on its developers. For the 5.15 cycle, the developers with the most test and review credits were:

Many of the people who accrue test credits in the kernel tend not to be otherwise visible within our community. What we are seeing is tags applied during the internal review process at some companies; many companies have such processes, but they don't all document that work in the patch tags. A similar thing often happens with the review tags, but that is not the case this time around. The top reviewers take on a number of roles in the kernel project; remember that the most active reviewer this time around (Christoph Hellwig) was also the most active contributor of changesets. 

#### Employers

Work on 5.15 was supported by 213 employers that we were able to identify. The most active employers were:

> Broadcom| 10202| 1.3%  
  
As usual, there aren't many surprises here. Paragon Software, which has not been seen on these lists before, shows up as the result of the ntfs3 contribution. Another thing worthy of note is that Huawei contributed 465 changesets to 5.15 — a substantial contribution but also big decrease from the company's 1,731 changesets in 5.14. Had Huawei sustained the 5.14 level of activity, this development cycle would have been comparable to its predecessors in terms of changesets merged. That said, almost all of the companies listed above had lower levels of contribution to 5.15 compared to 5.14. 

#### Code longevity

Finally, it can be interesting to look at how much code from each release has survived into the current kernel. This can be done with the brute-force technique of running `git blame` on each file in the kernel tree, then mapping the commit that created each line to the release in which it appeared. If one does this for the current Git history, the result looks like: 

> ![\[plot\]](https://static.lwn.net/images/2021/lineplot-5.15.png)

The code added in most releases makes up less than 2% of the code that is found in the 5.15 kernel; 5.15 itself accounts for 2.1% of the total. At the beginning of the Git era, just before the 2.6.12 release in 2005, the kernel had about 10.8 million lines of code. Over 16 years later, about 2.3 million of those lines (just under a quarter) still exist in 5.15, making up about 7.2% of the total. If one actually looks, much of that code takes the form of individual lines reading "`/*`" and the like, but that is not all of it. There are, for example, [still 72 files](/Articles/874422/) in the kernel tree that have never been changed since they were added as part of the initial commit in 2005. 

As for the other releases that stand out in the plot, there is usually a fairly straightforward explanation. 4.12, for example, included one of many large dumps of amdgpu register definition header files; those tend to live forever and are, probably, read by nobody. The same is true of 5.3 and 5.9, among other releases. In other cases it is not so clear; 5.6 saw the addition of the ath11k network driver and the WireGuard VPN, but those are not enough to explain why so much code persists from that release. 

How much of the new code from the 5.15 development cycle will remain in coming years is yet to be seen. As the plot above shows, though, kernel code has a certain longevity; much of it will be around until it is all rewritten in Rust someday. Expect the development community to continue adding and changing code at a high speed between now and then, though.

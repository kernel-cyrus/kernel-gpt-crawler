# BPF and the realtime patch set [LWN.net]

Back in July, Linus Torvalds merged a
patch
in the 5.3 merge window
that added the
PREEMPT_RT
option to the kernel build-time configuration.
That was meant as a 
signal that the realtime patch set was moving from its longtime status as
out-of-tree code to a fully supported kernel feature.  As the code behind
the configuration option makes its way into the mainline, some friction can
be expected; we are seeing a bit of that now with respect to the BPF subsystem.
The thread started with a patch
posted
by
Sebastian Andrzej Siewior to
the BPF mailing list.  The patch mentioned three problems with BPF running when
realtime is enabled and added Kconfig directives to only allow BPF to be
configured into kernels that did not have
PREEMPT_RT
:
Disable BPF on PREEMPT_RT because
it allocates and frees memory in atomic context
it uses up_read_non_owner()
BPF_PROG_RUN() expects to be invoked in non-preemptible context
Siewior said that he had tried to
address
the memory allocation problems
"
but I have no idea how to address the
other two issues
".   In that thread, he also gave an
overview
of what is needed to "play nicely" with the realtime patch set.
Daniel Borkmann
replied
that the
simple approach Siewior took would not actually disable all of BPF,
as there are other BPF-using subsystems that would not be affected by the
change.  Siewior
asked for
feedback
on one possible way to solve that, but David Miller
made
it clear
that he does not think this approach makes sense:
"
Turning off BPF just because PREEMPT_RT is enabled is a non-starter
it is 
absolutely essential functionality for a Linux system at this point.
"
However, as Siewior said, there are fundamental incompatibilities between the
implementation of BPF and the needs of the realtime patch set.  Thomas
Gleixner
provided
more detail
on the problem areas in the hopes of finding other ways to
deal with them:
#1) BPF disables preemption unconditionally with no way to do a proper RT
      substitution like most other infrastructure in the kernel provides
      via spinlocks or other locking primitives.
#2) BPF does allocations in atomic contexts, which is a dubious decision
      even for non RT. That's related to #1
#3) BPF uses the up_read_non_owner() hackery which was only invented to
      deal with already existing horrors and not meant to be proliferated.
Miller
replied
that BPF is needed by systemd and the IR drivers already; "
We're
moving to the point where even LSM modules will be implemented in
bpf.
"  In his earlier message, he said that turning off BPF would
disable any packet sniffing so that
tcpdump
and Wireshark would
not function.  To a certain extent, he oversold the need for BPF as
Gleixner
pointed
out
; Gleixner was running Debian testing with Siewior's patch applied and not
encountering any systemd or other difficulties.  Furthermore, even though packet
sniffing is not using BPF, thus requiring a copy to user space for each
packet, it does still work, Gleixner said, so that is not really an
argument for requiring BPF either.
Beyond that, though, he was really looking for feedback on
"
how to tackle these issues on a technical level
".  Some of
that did start to come about in a
sub-thread
with BPF maintainer Alexei Starovoitov, who wondered about disabling
preemption and noted that he is a "
complete noob in RT
".
Gleixner
explained
the situation at some length.
Essentially, the realtime kernel cannot
disable preemption or interrupts for arbitrarily long periods of time.
The realtime patches substitute realtime-aware locks for the spinlocks and
rwlocks that do disable preemption or interrupts in the non-realtime kernel.
Those realtime-aware locks can sleep, however, so they cannot be used from
within code sections that have explicitly disabled preemption or
interrupts.
As Starovoitov
explained
, BPF
disables preemption "
because of per-cpu maps and per-cpu data structures
that are shared between bpf program execution and kernel execution
".
But, he said, BPF does not call into code that might sleep, so there should
be no problems on that score.  But that is only when looking at the BPF code
from a non-realtime perspective, Gleixner
said
;
because of the lock substitution, code that does not look like it could
sleep actually can sleep since the realtime locks (e.g. sleeping spinlocks)
do so.  That's what makes using
preempt_disable()
(and
local_irq_disable()
) problematic in the realtime context.
He said that the
local_lock()
mechanism in the realtime tree might
be a way forward to better handle the explicit preemption disabling in BPF.
But, he said, 
there is still the outstanding problem of BPF making calls to
up_read_non_owner()
,
which allows a read-write semaphore (rwsem) to be unlocked by a process
that is not the owner of the lock.  That breaks the realtime requirement
that the locker is the same as the unlocker in order to deal with  priority
inheritance correctly.
Starovoitov also said that BPF does not have unbounded runtime within the
preemption-disabled sections, since it has a bound on the number of
instructions that can be in a BPF program.  But the limit on the number of instructions
was recently raised from 4096 to one million, which will result in
unacceptable preemption-disabled windows as Gleixner
noted
:
Assuming a instruction/cycle ratio of 1.0 and a CPU frequency of 2GHz,
that's 500us of preempt disabled time. Out of bounds by at least one order
of [magnitude] for a lot of RT scenarios.
Even the earlier limit of 4096 would result in 2Âµs of preemption-disabled
time, which may be problematic Clark Williams
said
; "[...]
there
are some customer cases on 
the horizon where 2us would be a significant fraction of their max latency
".
The
local_lock()
scheme
seemed viable
to Starovoitov, but he thought the overall approach taken by
Siewior's patch was backward:
But reading your other replies the gradual approach we're discussing here
doesn't sound acceptable ? And you guys insist on disabling bpf under RT
just to merge some out of tree code ? I find this rude and not acceptable.
If RT wants to get merged it should be disabled when BPF is on
and not the other way around.
But Gleixner
did
not see things that way
at all; he noted that he was planning to
investigate local locks as a possible way forward and that there was no
insistence on anything.  In addition, turning off realtime when BPF was
enabled was always an option; "[...]
I could have done that right
away without even talking to 
you. That'd have been dishonest and sneaky.
"  He also lamented that the
discussion had degraded to that point.
For his part, Starovoitov
said
that he simply thinks disabling an existing in-kernel feature in order to
ease the path for the realtime patches is likely to "
backfire on
RT
".  He suggested getting the code upstream without riling other
subsystem developers was a better way forward:
imo it's better to get key RT bits (like local_locks) in without
sending contentious patches like the one that sparked this thread.
When everyone can see what this local_lock is we can figure out
how and when to use it.
That's where things were left at the time of this writing.  It is not clear
that the practical effect of which subsystem disables the other makes any
real difference to users.  For now, users of BPF will not be able to use
the realtime patches and vice versa.  Fixing the underlying problems that
prevent the two from coexisting certainly seems more important than
squabbling over who disables who; there will
be users who want both in their systems after all.  For those who run mainline
kernels, though, that definitely cannot happen until realtime gets
upstream; once it does, a piecemeal approach to resolving the
incompatibilities between BPF and realtime can commence.

# Two new web sites [LWN.net]

Those of you who were watching in the early days of Linux kernel development will remember a series of web sites which consisted of a list of kernel releases and the changes to be found in each. Maintaining such a site is a considerable amount of work, however, and no such site has been operating for some time now. That has just changed, however, with Diego Calleja's [announcement](/Articles/155352/) of his [LinuxChanges page](http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges), hosted on the KernelNewbies site. The entries go all the way back to 2.5.1 (released almost four years ago) and provide a list of relevant changes for each release. It is a useful site which, one hopes, will be kept current for a long time to come. 

For those who are interested in the many projects underway in the networking subsystem, a visit to the new [linux-net wiki](http://linux-net.osdl.org/index.php/Main_Page) may be in order. Visitors cannot help being struck by the amount of work which is going on in this area.

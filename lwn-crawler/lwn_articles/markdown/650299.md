By the time Linus released [4.2-rc1](/Articles/650223/) and closed the merge window on July 5, 12,092 non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline kernel repository. That makes 4.2, by your editor's reckoning (but not Linus's — see below), the busiest merge window in the kernel project's history, beating the previous record holder, 3.15, by 58 commits. Even so, Linus doesn't believe that 4.2 will end up being the busiest development cycle for a simple reason: we have gotten better at fixing our code before it goes into the mainline, so fewer fixes are required thereafter. If one assumes that 3.15 had a higher fix rate than 4.2 will, then 4.2 should fall short of 3.15's total. 

Such ideas are relatively easy to explore using the numbers, so here is the history from the last few years or so, showing non-merge changesets for each kernel release: 

> Release| Merge  
> window| Total| %fixes  
> ---|---|---|---  
> v3.0 | 7333 | 9153 | 19.9  
> v3.1 | 7202 | 8693 | 17.2  
> v3.2 | 10214 | 11881 | 14.0  
> v3.3 | 8899 | 10550 | 15.6  
> v3.4 | 9248 | 10899 | 15.1  
> v3.5 | 9534 | 10957 | 13.0  
> v3.6 | 8587 | 10247 | 16.2  
> v3.7 | 10409 | 11990 | 13.2  
> v3.8 | 10901 | 12394 | 12.0  
> v3.9 | 10265 | 11910 | 13.8  
> v3.10 | 11963 | 13637 | 12.3  
> v3.11 | 9494 | 10893 | 12.8  
> v3.12 | 9479 | 10927 | 13.3  
> v3.13 | 10518 | 12127 | 13.3  
> v3.14 | 10622 | 12311 | 13.7  
> v3.15 | 12034 | 13722 | 12.3  
> v3.16 | 11364 | 12804 | 11.2

> v3.18 | 9711 | 11379 | 14.7

> v4.0 | 8950 | 10346 | 13.5

Since the beginning of the 3.x series, the average kernel release has seen 13.6% of its changes pulled after the close of the merge window. In the time between the releases of 3.15 and 4.1, 71,416 changesets were merged, of which 8,452 — 11.8% — came outside of the merge window. So one might conclude that the amount of code arriving outside the merge window has fallen a bit in the last year. If the 11.8% rate holds this time around, 4.2 will finish with 13,709 changesets, 13 short of the total for 3.15. 

So, it's _possible_ that 3.15 will remain the busiest development cycle ever, but your editor must conclude that the jury is still out on this one. 

In any case, the long-term trend is clear:

Over time, the kernel development community has indeed gotten better at merging code that does not require fixing later in the development cycle. 

#### Final changes for 4.2

There were just over 1,200 non-merge changesets pulled into the mainline kernel repository since [last week's summary](/Articles/649652/). Among those were: 

  * Large x86-based systems can now defer the initialization of much of main memory, speeding the boot process. 

  * Some changes affecting how mounts of sysfs and `/proc` are managed have been merged. Subdirectories that are meant to serve as mount points (e.g. `/sys/debug`) are now marked as such, and mounts are limited to those directories. Beyond that, new rules have been added to ensure that new mounts of these filesystems (within a container, say) respect the mount flags used with existing mounts. The [controversial](/Articles/647757/) enforcement of the `noexec` and `nosuid` flags has been removed for now, though. 

  * Synopsys DesignWare ARC HS38 processors are now supported. Other new hardware support includes Dell airplane-mode switches, TI TLC59108 and TLC59116 LED controllers, Maxim max77693 LED flash controllers, Skyworks AAT1290 LED controllers, Broadcom BCM6328 and BCM6358 LED controllers, Kinetic Technologies KTD2692 LED flash controllers, TI CDCE925 programmable clock synthesizers, Hisilicon Hi6220 clocks, STMicroelectronics LPC watchdogs, Conexant Digicolor SoC watchdogs, Dialog DA9062 watchdogs, and Weida HiTech I2C touchscreen controllers, 

  * The [red-black tree](/Articles/184495/) implementation now supports "latched trees"; these maintain two copies of the tree structure in parallel and only modify one at a time. The end result is that non-atomic modifications can happen concurrently with lookups without creating confusion. See [this commit](http://git.kernel.org/linus/ade3f510f93a5613b672febe88eff8ea7f1c63b7) for the implementation, and [this one](http://git.kernel.org/linus/6695b92a60bc7160c92d6dc5b17cc79673017c2f) for some discussion of the latched technique. The first use of this technique is to accelerate module address lookups. 




If recent patterns hold (and Linus doesn't take any more ill-timed vacations), the final 4.2 release can be expected on August 23. 

#### A postscript

Some readers may be wondering why this article claims that 4.2 had the busiest merge window ever, given that Linus said otherwise in the 4.2-rc1 release announcement: 

And it turns out v3.15-rc1 had more commits than 4.2-rc1 does (by a hair), so even there this isn't the biggest rc1 ever, if you count the number of commits. 

The difference is that Linus is counting merge commits, while your editor does not. As mentioned above, there were 12,092 non-merge changesets pulled before 4.2-rc1, but that number grows to 12,809 changesets when merges are counted; that falls just short of the total (12,826) for 3.15-rc1. Your editor's reasoning for leaving out merges is that they mostly just represent the movement of patches from one branch to another and, thus, differ from "real" development approaches. No doubt others will have different opinions, though.

Linus Torvalds [released](/Articles/726983/) the 4.12 kernel on July 2, marking the end of one of the busiest development cycles in the kernel project's history. Tradition requires that LWN publish a look at this kernel release and who contributed to it. 4.12 was, in many ways, a fairly normal cycle, but it shows the development community's continued growth. 

The 4.12 kernel includes 14,821 non-merge changesets contributed by 1,825 developers. That is not the highest changeset count we've ever seen — 4.9 is likely to hold that record for some time — but it comes in at a solid #2. The 4.12 kernel _did_ set a new record for the number of developers participating and for the number of first-time contributors (334), though. This was also a significant release for the growth of the kernel code base: 4.12 has just over one million lines of code more than its predecessor. 

The most active developers in the 4.12 cycle were:

For the second cycle in a row, Chris Wilson contributed the most changesets; almost all of them were changes to the Intel i915 graphics driver. Al Viro worked as usual in the virtual filesystem layer, but the bulk of his patches this time around were a reworking of the low-level user-space access code — a job that required changing a fair amount of architecture-specific machinery. Christoph Hellwig made a number of improvements in the block and filesystem layers, Tobin Harding focused on staging fixes, and Johan Hovold worked extensively in the USB subsystem and beyond. 

In a cycle where the kernel grows by a million lines, one can expect to see some developers adding a lot of code. Alex Deucher added more AMD graphic driver register definitions; `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include` now contains over 800,000 lines of such definitions. Alan Cox added the Intel "atomisp" camera drivers to the staging tree. Hans de Goede added the rtl8723bs WiFi driver (plus a bunch of other work), Hans-Christian Egtvedt bucked the trend by removing the unloved AVR32 architecture, and Gilad Ben-Yossef added the ARM TrustZone CryptoCell C7XX crypto accelerator drivers. 

Work on the 4.12 kernel was supported by at least 233 employers, a number which is pretty much in line with previous releases. The most active of those employers were:

As has been the case in recent years, there are not a lot of surprises to be found in this table. Kernel development may move quickly, but the commercial ecosystem surrounding it changes rather more slowly. 

Another way of looking at things is to ask what the companies above are actually working on. Looking at the data from after the 4.7 release now (one year's worth, essentially), and just looking at Intel's contributions, we see something like this: 

> Intel (9192 total)  
> ---  
> Percent| Directory| Notes  
> 38.3%| `drivers/gpu` | 32.0% `drivers/gpu/drm/i915`  
> 10.2%| `include`|   
> 9.6%| `driver/net`|   
> 5.4%| `drivers/staging` | Mostly the Lustre filesystem  
> 4.5%| `arch/x86`|   
> 4.0%| `drivers/infiniband`|   
> 3.5%| `sound`|   
> 3.4%| `drivers/usb`|   
> 3.1%| `tools`|   
  
Intel's work, thus, is mostly focused on support for Intel hardware — not a huge surprise, really. The company is routinely the kernel's largest single contributor, but it leaves core-kernel development to others. 

The results for Red Hat look rather different (once again, looking at patches after 4.7): 

> Red Hat (4947 total)  
> ---  
> Percent| Directory| Notes  
> 15.8%| `include`|   
> 14.8%| `fs`|   
> 11.8%| `tools` | Mostly perf  
> 10.6%| `net`|   
> 10.3%| `arch/x86`|   
> 9.3%| `drivers/gpu`|   
> 8.1%| `kernel`|   
> 5.5%| `drivers/net`|   
> 4.0%| `drivers/md`|   
> 2.6%| `arch/arm`|   
  
Red Hat clearly has a more generalist role in kernel development, making changes all over the tree and throughout the core. 

The next two rows in the table are for the hobbyists and the unknowns. The corresponding maps of where they are working are: 

> Unknown affiliation (5080 total)  
> ---  
> Percent| Directory| Notes  
> 22.6%| `drivers/staging`|   
> 7.8%| `net`|

> 6.6%| `drivers/net`|   
> 5.3%| `arch/arm`|   
> 5.3%| `drivers/gpu`|   
> 5.3%| `Documentation`| Mostly device-tree bindings  
> 4.7%| `sound`|   
>   
> No affiliation (4277 total)

> Percent| Directory| Notes

> 5.4%| `arch/arm`|   
> 4.9%| `drivers/gpu`|   
> 3.4%| `fs`|   
  
To complete the set, here's the results from some of the other top companies:

Clearly, each company is contributing to the kernel for its own reasons, and each focuses its effort accordingly. Hardware-oriented companies have a tendency to not look much beyond supporting their own products, while companies that deal more directly with the end users have a more general focus. Somehow, they all manage to work together and keep the kernel process going and the community growing in a consistent and predictable way.

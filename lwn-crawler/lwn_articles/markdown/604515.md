This article was contributed by David Drysdale

The [previous article](/Articles/604287/) explored the kernel implementation of system calls (syscalls) in its most vanilla form: a normal syscall, on the most common architecture: x86_64. We complete our look at syscalls with variations on that basic theme, covering other x86 architectures and other syscall mechanisms. We start by exploring the various 32-bit x86 architecture variants, for which a map of the territory involved may be helpful. The map is clickable on the filenames and arrow labels to link to the code referenced:

#### x86_32 syscall invocation via `SYSENTER`

The normal invocation of a system call on a 32-bit x86_32 system is closely analogous to the mechanism for x86_64 systems that was described in the previous article. Here, the `arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl` table has an [entry](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl#L12) for `sys_read`: 
    
    
        3	i386	read			sys_read
    

This entry indicates that `read()` for x86_32 has syscall number 3, with entry point `sys_read()` and an `i386` calling convention. The [table post-processor](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/syscalls/syscalltbl.sh) will emit a `__SYSCALL_I386(3, sys_read, sys_read)` macro call into the generated `arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_32.h` file. This, in turn, is used to [build](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/syscall_32.c) the syscall table, `sys_call_table`, as before. 

Moving outward, `sys_call_table` is accessed from the [`ia32_sysenter_target`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S#L384) entry point of [`arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S#L435). However, here the [`SAVE_ALL`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S#L186) macro actually pushes a different set of registers (EBX/ECX/EDX/ESI/EDI/EBP rather than RDI/RSI/RDX/R10/R8/R9) onto the stack, reflecting the different syscall ABI convention for this platform. 

The location of the `ia32_sysenter_target` entry point gets [written](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-setup.c#L240) to a model-specific register (MSR) at kernel start (in `enable_sep_cpu()`); in this case, the MSR in question is [`MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/msr-index.h#L54) (0x176), which is used for handling the `SYSENTER` instruction. 

This shows the invocation path from userspace. The standard modern ABI for how x86_32 programs invoke a system call is to put the system call number (3 for `read()`) into the EAX register, and the other parameters into specific registers (EBX, ECX, and EDX for the first 3 parameters), then invoke the `SYSENTER` instruction. 

This instruction causes the processor to transition to ring 0 and invoke the code referenced by the `MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP` model-specific register — namely `ia32_sysenter_target`. That code pushes the registers onto the (kernel) stack, and calls the function pointer at entry EAX in `sys_call_table` — namely `sys_read()`, which is a thin, `asmlinkage` wrapper for the real implementation in `SYSC_read()`. 

#### x86_32 syscall invocation via `INT 0x80`

The `sys_call_table` table is also accessed in [`arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S#L515) from the [`system_call`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S#L503) assembly entry point. Again, this entry point saves registers to the stack, then uses the EAX register to pick the relevant entry in `sys_call_table` and call it. This time, the location of the `system_call` entry point is [used](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L771) by `trap_init()`: 
    
    
        #ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
        	set_system_trap_gate(SYSCALL_VECTOR, &system_call);
        	set_bit(SYSCALL_VECTOR, used_vectors);
        #endif
    

This sets up the handler for the [`SYSCALL_VECTOR`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/irq_vectors.h#L51) trap to be `system_call`; that is, it sets it up to be the recipient of the venerable `INT 0x80` software interrupt method for invoking system calls.

This is the original user-space invocation path for system calls, which is now generally avoided because, on modern processors, it's slower than the instructions that are specifically designed for system call invocation (`SYSCALL` and `SYSENTER`). 

With this older ABI, programs invoke a system call by putting the system call number into the EAX register, and the other parameters into specific registers (EBX, ECX, and EDX for the first 3 parameters), then invoking the `INT 0x80` instruction. This instruction causes the processor to transition to ring 0 and invoke the trap handler for software interrupt 0x80 — namely `system_call`. The `system_call` code pushes the registers onto the (kernel) stack, and calls the function pointer at entry EAX in the `sys_call_table` table — namely `sys_read()`, the thin, `asmlinkage` wrapper for the real implementation in `SYSC_read()`. Much of that should seem familiar, as it is the same as for using `SYSENTER`. 

#### x86 syscall invocation mechanisms

For reference, the different user-space syscall invocation mechanisms on x86 we've seen so far are as follows: 

  * 64-bit programs use the `SYSCALL` instruction. This instruction was originally introduced by AMD, but was subsequently implemented on Intel 64-bit processors and so is the best choice for [cross-platform compatibility](http://wiki.osdev.org/SYSENTER#Compatibility_across_Intel_and_AMD).

  * Modern 32-bit programs use the `SYSENTER` instruction, which has been present since Intel introduced the IA-32 architecture.

  * Ancient 32-bit programs use the `INT 0x80` instruction to trigger a software interrupt handler, but this is much slower than `SYSENTER` on modern processors.




#### x86_32 syscall invocation on x86_64

Now for a more complicated case: what happens if we are running a 32-bit binary on our x86_64 system? From the user-space perspective, nothing is different; in fact, nothing can be different, because the user code being run is exactly the same. 

For the `SYSENTER` case, an x86_64 kernel [registers](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-setup.c#L210) a different function as the handler in the `MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP` model-specific register. This function has the same name (`ia32_sysenter_target`) as the x86_32 code but a different [definition](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L118) (in `arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S`). In particular, it pushes the old-style registers but uses a different syscall table, [`ia32_sys_call_table`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L163). This table is [built](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/syscall_ia32.c#L18) from the 32-bit table of entries; in particular, it will have entry 3 (as used on 32-bit systems), rather than 0 (which is the syscall number for `read()` on 64-bit systems), mapping to `sys_read()`. 

For the `INT 0x80` case, the `trap_init()` code on x86_64 [instead invokes](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L765):
    
    
        #ifdef CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION
        	set_system_intr_gate(IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR, ia32_syscall);
        	set_bit(IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR, used_vectors);
        #endif
    

This maps the `IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR` (which is [still](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/irq_vectors.h#L49) 0x80) to `ia32_syscall`. This assembly entry point (in [`arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L399)) uses `ia32_sys_call_table` rather than the 64-bit `sys_call_table`. 

#### A more complex example: `execve` and 32-bit compatibility handling

Now let's look at a system call that involves other complications: `execve()`. We'll again work outward from the kernel implementation of the system call, and explore the differences from the simpler `read()` call along the way. Again, a clickable map of the territory we're going to explore might help things along: 

![](https://static.lwn.net/images/2014/execve.png)

The `execve()` definition in [`fs/exec.c`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/fs/exec.c#L1614) looks similar to that for `read()`, but there is an interesting additional function defined right after it (at least when [`CONFIG_COMPAT`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/Kconfig#L2382) is defined):
    
    
        SYSCALL_DEFINE3(execve,
    		    const char __user *, filename,
        		    const char __user *const __user *, argv,
        		    const char __user *const __user *, envp)
        {
        	    return do_execve(getname(filename), argv, envp);
        }
        #ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
        asmlinkage long compat_sys_execve(const char __user * filename,
        	    const compat_uptr_t __user * argv,
        	    const compat_uptr_t __user * envp)
        {
        	    return compat_do_execve(getname(filename), argv, envp);
        }
        #endif
    

Following the processing path, these two implementations converge on `do_execve_common()` to perform the real work (`sys_execve()` → `do_execve()` → `do_execve_common()` versus `compat_sys_execve()` → `compat_do_execve()` → `do_execve_common()`), setting up [`user_arg_ptr`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/fs/exec.c#L387) structures along the way. These structures hold those syscall arguments that are pointers-to-pointers, together with an indication of whether they come from a 32-bit compatibility ABI; if so, the value being pointed to is a 32-bit user-space address, not a 64-bit value, and the [code to copy](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/fs/exec.c#L399) the argument values from user space needs to allow for that. 

So, unlike `read()`, where the syscall implementation didn't need to distinguish between 32-bit and 64-bit callers because the arguments were pointers-to-values, `execve()` does need to distinguish, because it has arguments that are pointers-to-pointers. This turns out to be a common theme — other `compat_sys__name_()` entry points are there to cope with pointer-to-pointer arguments (or pointer-to-struct-containing-pointer arguments, for example `struct iovec` or `struct aiocb`). 

#### x32 ABI support

The complication of having two variant implementations of `execve()` spreads outward from the code to the system call tables. For x86_64, the [64-bit table](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl) has two distinct entries for `execve()`:
    
    
        59	64	execve			stub_execve
        ...
        520	x32	execve			stub_x32_execve
    

The additional entry in the 64-bit table at syscall number 520 is for [**x32** ABI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI) programs, which run on x86_64 processors but use 32-bit pointers. As a result of the `64` and `x32` ABI indicators, we will end up with `stub_execve` as entry 59 in `sys_call_table`, and `stub_x32_execve` as entry 520. 

Although this is our first mention of the x32 ABI, it turns out that our previous `read()` example did quietly include x32 ABI compatibility. As no pointer-to-pointer address translation was needed, the syscall invocation path (and syscall number) could simply be shared with the 64-bit version. 

Both [`stub_execve`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S#L862) and [`stub_x32_execve`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S#L906) are defined in `arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S`. These entry points call on `sys_execve()` and `compat_sys_execve()`, but also save additional registers (R12-R15, RBX, and RBP) to the kernel stack. Similar `stub_*` wrappers are also present in `arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S` for other syscalls (`rt_sigreturn()`, `clone()`, `fork()`, and `vfork()`) that may potentially need to restart user-space execution at a different address and/or with a different user stack than when the syscall was invoked. 

For x86_32, the 32-bit table has an [entry for `execve()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl#L20) that's slightly different in format from that for `read()`: 
    
    
        11	i386	execve			sys_execve			stub32_execve
    

First of all, this tells us that `execve()` has syscall number of 11 on 32-bit systems, as compared to number 59 (or 520) on 64-bit systems. More interesting to observe is the presence of an extra field in the 32-bit table, holding a compatibility entry point `stub32_execve`. For a native 32-bit build of the kernel, this extra field is [ignored](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/syscall_32.c#L8) and the `sys_call_table` holds `sys_execve()` as entry 11, as usual.

However, for a 64-bit build of the kernel, the IA-32 compatibility code [inserts](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/syscall_ia32.c#L12) the `stub32_execve()` entry point into `ia32_sys_call_table` as entry 11. This entry point is defined in [`arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L466) as: 
    
    
        PTREGSCALL stub32_execve, compat_sys_execve
    

The [`PTREGSCALL`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L455) macro sets up the `stub32_execve` entry point to call on to `compat_sys_execve()` (by putting its address into RAX), and saves additional registers (R12-R15, RBX, and RBP) to the kernel stack (like `stub_execve()` above). 

#### `gettimeofday()`: vDSO

Some system calls just read a small amount of information from the kernel, and for these, the full machinery of a ring transition is a lot of overhead. The vDSO (Virtual Dynamically-linked Shared Object) mechanism speeds up some of these read-only syscalls by mapping the page containing the relevant information (and code to read it) into user space, read-only. In particular, the page is set up in the format of an ELF shared-library, so it can be straightforwardly linked into user programs. 

Running `ldd` on a normal glibc-using binary shows the vDSO as a dependency on `linux-vdso.so.1` or `linux-gate.so.1` (which `ldd` obviously can't find a file to back); it also shows up in the memory map of a running process (`[vdso]` in `cat /proc/_PID_ /maps`). 

Historically, [vsyscall](https://lwn.net/Articles/446528/) was an earlier mechanism to do something similar, which is now deprecated due to security concerns. This [older article by Johan Petersson](http://www.trilithium.com/johan/2005/08/linux-gate/) describes how vsyscall's page appears as an ELF object (at a fixed position) to user space. 

There's a [Linux Journal article](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/creating-vdso-colonels-other-chicken) that discusses vDSO setup in some detail (although it is now slightly out of date), so we'll just describe the basics here, as applied to the `gettimeofday()` syscall. 

First, `gettimeofday()` needs to access data. To allow this, the relevant [`vsyscall_gtod_data` structure](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall_64.c#L57) is [exported](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/vvar.h#L36) into a special data section called `.vvar_vsyscall_gtod_data`. [Linker instructions](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S#L155) then ensure that this `.vvar_vsyscall_gtod_data` section is linked into the kernel in the `__vvar_page` section, and at kernel startup the [`setup_arch()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/setup.c#L857) function [calls](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/setup.c#L1186) `map_vsyscall()` to [set up a fixed mapping](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall_64.c#L387) for that `__vvar_page`. 

The code that provides the core vDSO implementation of `gettimeofday()` is in [`__vdso_gettimeofday()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vclock_gettime.c#L260). It's marked as [`notrace`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/linkage.h#L7) to prevent the compiler from ever adding function profiling, and also gets a weak alias as [`gettimeofday()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vclock_gettime.c#L281). To ensure that the resulting page looks like an ELF shared object, the [`vdso.lds.S`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vdso.lds.S) file pulls in [`vdso-layout.lds.S`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vdso-layout.lds.S) and exports both `gettimeofday()` and `__vdso_gettimeofday()` into the page. 

To make the vDSO page accessible to a new user-space program, the code in [`setup_additional_pages()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vma.c#L151) sets the vDSO page location to a random address chosen by [`vdso_addr()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vma.c#L124) at process start time. Using a random address mitigates the security problems found with the earlier vsyscall implementation, but does mean that the user program needs a way to find the location of the vDSO page. The location is exposed to user space as an [ELF auxiliary value](/Articles/519085/): the binary loader for ELF format programs ([`load_elf_binary()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L566)) uses the [`ARCH_DLINFO` macro](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h#L297) to set the `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR` auxiliary value. The user-space program can then find the page using the [getauxval()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getauxval.3.html) function to retrieve the relevant auxiliary value (although in practice the `libc` library usually takes care of this under the covers). 

For completeness, we should also mention that the vDSO mechanism is used for another important syscall-related feature for 32-bit programs. At boot time, the kernel determines which of the possible x86_32 syscall invocation mechanisms is best, and puts the appropriate implementation wrapper ([`SYSENTER`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vdso32/sysenter.S#L31), [`INT 0x80`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vdso32/int80.S#L13), or even [`SYSCALL`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/vdso/vdso32/syscall.S#L16) for an AMD 64-bit processor) into the `__kernel_vsyscall` function. User-space programs can then invoke this wrapper and be sure of getting the fastest way into the kernel for their syscalls; see Petersson's article for more details. 

#### `ptrace()`: syscall tracing

The [`ptrace()`](http://linux.die.net/man/2/ptrace) system call is implemented in the normal manner, but it's particularly relevant here because it can cause system calls of the traced kernel task to behave differently. Specifically, the `PTRACE_SYSCALL` request aims to ""arrange for the tracee to be stopped at the next entry to or exit from a system call"". 

Requesting `PTRACE_SYSCALL` causes the `TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE` thread information flag to [be set](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/kernel/ptrace.c#L727) in thread-specific data ([`struct thread_info.flags`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#L28)). The effect of this is [architecture-specific](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/kernel/ptrace.c#L1071); we'll describe the x86_64 implementation. 

Looking more closely at the assembly for syscall entry (in all of [x86_32](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S#L430), [x86_64](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S#L618), and [ia32](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L155)) we see a detail that we skipped over previously: if the thread flags have any of the [`_TIF_WORK_SYSCALL_ENTRY`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#L123) flags (which include `TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE`) set, the syscall implementation code follows a different path to invoke `syscall_trace_enter()` instead ([x86_32](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S#L660), [x86_64](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S#L732), [ia32](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L247)). The [`syscall_trace_enter()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/arch/x86/kernel/ptrace.c#L1457) function then performs a variety of different functions that are associated with the various per-thread flag values that were checked for with `_TIF_WORK_SYSCALL_ENTRY`: 

  * `TIF_SINGLESTEP`: single stepping of instructions for ptrace
  * `TIF_SECCOMP`: perform secure computing checks on syscall entry
  * `TIF_SYSCALL_EMU`: perform syscall emulation
  * `TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE`: syscall tracing for ptrace
  * `TIF_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINT`: syscall tracing for [ftrace](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt)
  * `TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT`: generation of syscall audit records

In other words, `syscall_trace_enter` is the control point for a whole collection of different per-syscall interception functionality — including `TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE` syscall tracing. It ends up calling [`ptrace_stop()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.14/source/kernel/signal.c#L1839) with `why=CLD_TRAPPED`, which notifies the tracing program (via `SIGCHLD`) that the tracee has been stopped on entry to a syscall. 

#### Epilogue

System calls have been the standard method for user-space programs to interact with Unix kernels for decades and, consequently, the Linux kernel includes a set of facilities to make it easy to define them and to efficiently use them. Despite the invocation variations across architectures and occasional special cases, system calls also remain a remarkably homogeneous mechanism — this stability and homogeneity allows all sorts of useful tools, from `strace` to [seccomp-bpf](/Articles/475043/), to work in a generic way.

# The Developer's Certificate of Origin, v1.1 [LWN.net]

When 2.6.12 is released, it will include a new version of the "developer's certificate of origin," the statement which must be made by anybody submitting a patch for merging into the mainline. Version 1.1 of the DCO includes a new phrase: 

I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved. 

The full text of the DCO can be found in [SubmittingPatches](/Articles/139918/) file in the Documentation directory. 

This change was motivated by the actions of one kernel subsystem maintainer who feels that the UK Data Protection Act requires that he strip email addresses from patches which pass through him. The new version of the DCO will, in theory, turn a "Signed-off-by:" header into an active granting of permission to redistribute the contact information which comes with the patch.

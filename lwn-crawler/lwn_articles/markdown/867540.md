The 5.14 kernel was [released on August 29](/Articles/867742/) after a nine-week development period. This cycle was not as active as its predecessor, which set a record for the number of developers involved, but there was still a lot going on and a number of long-awaited features were merged. Now that the release is out, the time has come for our traditional look at where the code in 5.14 came from and how it got there. 

To create 5.14, the kernel community applied 14,735 non-merge changesets from 1,912 developers; 261 of those developers made their first kernel contribution during this cycle. There were 861,000 lines of code added to the kernel and 321,000 lines removed, for a net growth of 540,000 lines. 

The most active 5.14 developers were:

Lee Jones seems to have staked out a permanent position as the lead contributor of changesets; he continues to focus on cleanups and warning fixes all over the kernel tree. Andy Shevchenko made a lot of fixes throughout the driver subsystem. Mauro Carvalho Chehab worked mostly in the media subsystem with a bunch of documentation fixes on the side, Peng Li contributed a set of style fixes to various network drivers, and Yang Yingliang fixed a lot of warnings in various drivers. 

In the "changed lines" column we see Aaron Liu and Aurabindo Jayamohanan Pillai on top with the inevitable set of amdgpu header files. Christoph Hellwig continues to do extensive refactoring work, mostly in the block subsystem. Mustafa Ismail contributed [one patch series](/ml/netdev/20210602205138.889-1-shiraz.saleem@intel.com/) adding the Intel Ethernet protocol driver for RDMA, and James Smart added [a new SCSI driver](/ml/linux-scsi/20210601235512.20104-1-jsmart2021@gmail.com/).

Huawei has found its way to the top of the list of changeset contributors again. Otherwise there is little new or surprising in this list. 

Since the [beginning](/Articles/222773/), these reports have looked specifically at _non-merge_ changesets, following the reasoning that those are the changes that contain the "real work". Merges, instead, are just the movement of patches from one Git branch or repository to another. That said, merges are a big part of a maintainer's work; each merge requires a look at the code involved and a judgment that the time has come to move that code along to the next stop on its path to the mainline kernel. So perhaps a look at merges, too, makes sense. The most active creators of merge commits in the 5.14 development cycle were: 

> Merge contributors in 5.14  
> ---  
> Linus Torvalds| 384| 33.8%  
> David S. Miller | 230| 20.2%  
> Olof Johansson | 82| 7.2%  
> Mark Brown | 54| 4.8%  
> Dave Airlie | 52| 4.6%  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman | 35| 3.1%  
> Rafael J. Wysocki | 28| 2.5%  
> Jakub Kicinski | 28| 2.5%  
> Bjorn Helgaas | 25| 2.2%  
> Will Deacon | 24| 2.1%  
> Arnd Bergmann | 16| 1.4%  
> Marc Zyngier | 14| 1.2%  
> Stephen Boyd | 13| 1.1%  
> Takashi Iwai | 10| 0.9%  
> Paolo Bonzini | 8| 0.7%  
> Jens Axboe | 8| 0.7%  
> Darrick J. Wong | 8| 0.7%  
> Thomas Gleixner | 6| 0.5%

> Jiri Kosina | 6| 0.5%  
  
Linus Torvalds tends to be notably absent from the statistics in these reports; after all, by his own admission, he does not write much code these days. The merge numbers show where part of his activity is, though; he handles hundreds of pull requests from subsystem maintainers, looks at each one (often more closely than one might expect), and does the merge if it seems like the right thing to do. In the process, he generates one-third of the merges in the kernel history. 

There are, however, two ways that any given patch moves through the chain of subsystem maintainers. One is via pull requests, each of which will generate one of the merges seen in the above table. But, before that can happen, a maintainer somewhere must apply the patch to their Git repository to start the process. When that happens, the maintainer will apply a Signed-off-by tag to the patch. To see that aspect of maintainer activity, one needs to look at those tags when applied to patches written by somebody else; the result for 5.14 is: 

> Non-author signoffs in 5.14  
> ---  
> David S. Miller | 1625| 11.0%  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman | 1118| 7.5%  
> Alex Deucher | 867| 5.8%  
> Mark Brown | 541| 3.6%  
> Andrew Morton| 489| 3.3%  
> Martin K. Petersen | 332| 2.2%  
> Paolo Bonzini | 324| 2.2%  
> Jens Axboe | 324| 2.2%  
> Mauro Carvalho Chehab | 284| 1.9%  
> Michael Ellerman | 273| 1.8%  
> Takashi Iwai | 216| 1.5%  
> Jason Gunthorpe | 213| 1.4%  
> Hans Verkuil | 209| 1.4%  
> Guangbin Huang | 180| 1.2%  
> Will Deacon | 176| 1.2%  
> Bjorn Andersson | 170| 1.1%  
> Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo | 169| 1.1%  
> Jakub Kicinski | 154| 1.0%  
> Jonathan Cameron | 148| 1.0%  
> Herbert Xu | 144| 1.0%  
  
Here, we see the maintainers who tend to apply patches directly rather than acting on pull requests; there are some names that appear on both but, in the end, this is a different list. The fact that David Miller appears at the top of both lists just confirms that he gets more done than just about anybody else â€” it is more than good to seem him apparently running at full capacity again. It also reflects a style of work that involves applying patches to topic branches, then merging them into the local trunk to send upstream; each patch series applied generates a set of non-author signoffs _and_ a merge commit. Other maintainers apply patches directly to upstream-bound branches and do not generate these merges. 

Either way, the maintainers who shepherd patches through the system are performing a crucial function within the kernel development process. Without this work, all of those developers cranking out patches would have no place to send them. Maintainership is hard and often unrewarding work; we all owe them some gratitude for keeping this whole development process going. 

All told, the kernel development community appears to be continuing to operate smoothly at its usual fast pace. As of this writing, the 5.15 development cycle is already underway with large amounts of work queued to be merged. We will see the above story repeat, with variations of course, over the next nine or ten weeks.

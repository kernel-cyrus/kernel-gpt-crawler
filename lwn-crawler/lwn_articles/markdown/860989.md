As expected, the 5.13 development cycle turned out to be a busy one, with 16,030 non-merge changesets being pulled into the mainline over a period of nine weeks. The [5.13 release](/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wj7E9iTGHbqfgtaTAM09WrVzwXjda2_D59MT8D_1=54Rg@mail.gmail.com/) happened on June 27, meaning that it must be time for our traditional look at the provenance of the code that was merged for this kernel. 

In terms of changeset counts, 5.13 was not the busiest development cycle ever; that record still belongs to 5.8, with 16,306 changesets merged; indeed, 5.10 (16,174) was also busier. But 5.13 did set a record by including the work of 2,062 developers — the first time more than 2,000 developers have participated in a single release cycle. Of those developers, 329 contributed their first patch to the kernel in this cycle, a number that just matches the previous record set by 4.12. 

The most active developers this time were:

Lee Jones, once again, contributed more changesets than anybody else; that work continues to focus on cleanups and removal of warnings. Fabio Aiuto and Marco Cesati (among others) were part of what appears to be an organized effort to get the rtl8723bs wireless network driver out of staging; no less than 26 developers made 450 patches to this driver for 5.13. Sean Christopherson continues to massively rework the KVM subsystem, and Pierre-Louis Bossart made a lot of cleanups to the sound subsystem. 

The 125,000 lines of code added to the kernel by Hawking Zhang are, of course, more amdgpu header files; there are now almost 2.4 million lines of code under `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include`. Greg Kroah-Hartman removed an unloved staging driver and reverted a lot of patches as the result of the [UMN patch review](/Articles/854645/). Jiri Slaby removed a number of old TTY drivers, and Dmitry Baryshkov refactored a number of clock and DRM drivers. 

Work on 5.13 was supported by a minimum of 232 employers, the most active of which were:

As usual, there are few surprises here. 

Of course, companies don't write patches, developers do. Many companies put significant effort into hiring community developers, but where do those developers come from in the first place? A little bit of light can be cast onto this question by looking at who developers are working for when they get their first patch into the kernel. One might expect that developers start as volunteers, proving that they can do kernel work before being paid to do it, and indeed many kernel developers begin that way. But others are already on the job when that first patch lands. 

In the case of 5.13, 150 of the 329 first-time contributors were on the job from the beginning. The companies and other organizations that employed at least two first-time kernel contributors were: 

> Employers of first-time contributors  
> ---  
> Company| Developers  
> Huawei Technologies| 30  
> AMD| 16  
> Intel| 12  
> Google| 11  
> Samsung|  6  
> MediaTek|  5  
> Code Aurora Forum|  4  
> IBM|  4  
> Microchip Technology Inc.| 3  
> Microsoft| 3  
> Cirrus Logic| 2  
> Red Hat| 2  
> Habana Labs| 2  
> Facebook| 2  
> NXP Semiconductors| 2  
> NVIDIA| 2  
> ZTE Corporation| 2  
  
That leaves 179 first-time contributors, two of whom were Outreachy interns and two of whom were known to be working on their own time. If one assumes that most (but not all) of the rest of the unknowns are also volunteers, the logical conclusion is that at least half of our first-time contributors did their work as part of their job. That suggests that some companies, at least, are working to bring new developers into the kernel community. 

As for what those first-time developers were doing, these are the directories most often touched by first-time patches: 

> Directory| Patches  
> ---|---  
> drivers/staging| 49  
> drivers/net| 27  
> Documentation| 21  
> drivers/gpu| 21  
> net| 17  
> include| 16  
> sound| 15  
> tools| 13  
> arch/arm| 11  
> drivers/hid| 10  
  
The staging tree is the most popular place for a first-time patch, unsurprisingly. The networking core or GPU drivers are less obvious places for an aspiring kernel developer to start, though; that may well be the sort of place where developers who are learning on the job make their start. 

In summary: the kernel community continues to merge patches and make releases at an impressive pace. For all of the challenges that new developers must overcome, the community is gaining more developers than ever before. Things, it seems, are not going all that badly. As of this writing, there are nearly 12,500 patches waiting in linux-next - a big pile, but still 1,000 fewer than were queued for 5.13. So the 5.14 cycle may be slower than 5.13 — but only a little bit.

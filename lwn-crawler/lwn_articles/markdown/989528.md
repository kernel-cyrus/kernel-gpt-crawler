The 6.11 kernel was [released](/ml/all/CAHk-=whVpSHw9+4ov=oLevfv8sPYbh59T_9VKif-6Vqkr41jQA@mail.gmail.com/) on September 15 after a typical nine-week development cycle. This release integrates 13,890 non-merge changesets, so it was a moderately busy cycle, slightly more so that 6.10 was. With a new release comes a new round of development statistics; read on for the details. 

This release was contributed to by 1,970 developers, of whom 250 were first-time contributors. The most active contributors this time around were:

The most prolific contributor of changesets this time around was Jeff Johnson, whose work consisted almost entirely of adding `MODULE_DESCRIPTION()` lines to modules that were lacking them. Krzysztof Kozlowski continued a long-running series of cleanups in many parts of the driver tree. Jani Nikula worked extensively in the graphics subsystem (and i915 driver specifically), Kent Overstreet continued to work to stabilize the bcachefs filesystem, and Ville Syrjälä joined Nikula in i915 driver work. 

In the "changed lines" column, Aurabindo Pillai contributed 27 commits adding yet another big pile of amdgpu register definitions; Hawking Zhang's 21 commits made that pile even bigger. Ian Rogers added another set of perf vendor-event definitions. Likun Gao also worked on the amdgpu driver, and Alexander Duyck added the fbnic network driver.

As always, Daniel Wheeler tests AMD graphics patches at a rate of about five per day. Other testers are somewhat less prolific, but their work is equally valuable. On the review side, Dmitry Baryshkov has been busy with numerous mobile drivers, Rodrigo Vivi reviewed lots of i915 graphics-driver patches, and Kozlowski reviewed many devicetree changes. 

Looking at the Signed-off-by tags added to patches can yield some interesting insights. Specifically, tags added by people other than the author track the handling of patches, especially the point where any given patch turns into a commit in some repository. Those non-author signoffs show us who the gatekeepers to the kernel are. In 6.11, the most non-author signoffs came from: 

> Who| Signoffs| Subsystem  
> ---|---|---  
> Alex Deucher | 1034| 8.0% | AMD graphics  
> Jakub Kicinski | 581| 4.5% | Networking  
> Andrew Morton| 560| 4.4% | Memory management  
> Mark Brown | 531| 4.1% | Regulator, sound, SPI  
> Bjorn Andersson | 484| 3.8% | Qualcomm  
> Greg Kroah-Hartman | 425| 3.3% | Drivers  
> Hans Verkuil | 239| 1.9% | Media  
> David S. Miller | 234| 1.8% | Networking  
> Jonathan Cameron | 231| 1.8% | Industrial I/O  
> Jens Axboe | 227| 1.8% | Block, io_uring  
> Lee Jones | 177| 1.4% | LED, MFD  
> Paolo Abeni | 170| 1.3% | Networking  
> David Sterba | 161| 1.3% | Btrfs  
> Kalle Valo | 154| 1.2% | WiFi  
> Johannes Berg | 144| 1.1% | WiFi  
> Bjorn Helgaas | 139| 1.1% | PCI  
> Krzysztof Wilczyński | 132| 1.0% | PCI  
> Shawn Guo | 131| 1.0% | NXP devicetree  
> Namhyung Kim | 131| 1.0% | Perf  
> Christian Brauner | 131| 1.0% | Filesystems  
  
This table has changed a bit over time. Networking was once concentrated under a single maintainer, and thus often appeared at the top of the list; that maintainership has now been split across multiple developers. Greg Kroah-Hartman's traditional position near the top of the table has been ceded to others, at least for now, as churn in the staging tree has decreased. 

Graphics drivers again led to a position at the top of the list. Interestingly, though, AMD graphics is represented here, but Intel graphics is not. That is because of the more distributed nature of maintainership on the Intel side. As we saw above, Nikula and Syrjälä both contributed many i915 graphics changes. But, since they committed those changes to the relevant repositories themselves, no other developer's signoff appears there. The Intel graphics subsystem is nearly unique in operating this way. 

Associating non-author signoffs with employers yields this result: 

> Google| 1477| 11.5%  
> ---|---|---  
> Intel| 1350| 10.5%  
> AMD| 1327| 10.3%  
> Meta| 1060| 8.2%  
> Red Hat| 875| 6.8%  
> Linaro| 846| 6.6%  
> Qualcomm| 707| 5.5%  
> Arm| 667| 5.2%  
> Linux Foundation| 503| 3.9%  
> (Unknown)| 451| 3.5%  
> SUSE| 307| 2.4%  
> (None)| 281| 2.2%  
> Huawei Technologies| 276| 2.1%  
> Cisco| 239| 1.9%  
> IBM| 223| 1.7%  
> NVIDIA| 200| 1.6%  
> Microsoft| 196| 1.5%  
> Oracle| 168| 1.3%  
> MediaTek| 145| 1.1%  
> Texas Instruments| 137| 1.1%  
  
[**Note** : an error in the above table was corrected on September 23.] About half of all commits going into the mainline pass through maintainers working for just five companies. This situation has been stable for many years, though the specific companies involved has changed somewhat over time. 

Work on 6.11 was supported by 213 companies that we were able to identify. The most active of those companies were:

At this point, nearly 25% of the commits landing in the mainline came from developers working for just two chip manufacturers — Intel and AMD — and, as we have seen, quite a bit of their work is focused on keeping their graphics drivers working. Beyond that, there is not much that is noteworthy in the above numbers. 

As of this writing, there are less than 10,000 commits in linux-next, suggesting that the 6.12 development cycle will be a relatively slow one, at least with regard to changeset counts. There are some significant changes on deck for that release, though. LWN will, of course, follow the development of that release as it happens.

# Attacking the kernel via its command line [LWN.net]

June 20, 2017

The kernel's command line allows the specification of many operating
parameters at boot time.  A silly bug in command-line parsing was reported
by Ilya Matveychikov on MayÂ 22; it can be exploited to force a stack
buffer overflow with a controlled payload that can overwrite memory. The
bug itself stems from a bounds-checking error that, while simple, has still
been in the Linux kernel source since version 2.6.20. The subsequent
disclosure
post
by
Matveychikov in the oss-security list spawned a discussion on what
constitutes a vulnerability, and what is, instead, merely a bug.
Many kernel command-line parameters allow the specification of an array of
integer values, using a syntax like:
foo=1-10
Within the kernel, the result of such a parameter will be the filling of an
array with the values one through ten.  Array parameters are parsed with the
get_options()
function:
char *get_options(const char *str, int nints, int *ints);
The
nints
value specifies the maximum number of integer values
that should be placed into the
ints
array.  Unfortunately, nobody
noticed that
get_options()
simply ignores
nints
; if the
command line contains a parameter like
foo=1-1000000
, one-million
entries will be written, regardless of whether the destination array has
the space to hold them.  There are just over 200
get_options()
call sites in the 4.12-rc6 kernel; any one of them could be used to
overwrite memory via a hostile command line.
The example
Matveychikov provided gave a huge range for the
netdev
parameter, triggering the bug.
The overflow can be demonstrated while booting an affected kernel
using
qemu
:
qemu-system-x86_64 -no-reboot -no-shutdown -kernel \
        /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-66-generic -append "netdev=3735928559-3735999999"
The numbers were chosen so that it wrote variants of the
hexadecimal number 0xdeadbeef over and over when overflowing into
memory (3735928559=0xdeadbeef),
demonstrating that a controlled (if restricted) payload is possible. 
Matveychikov's
patch
fixing the error was
sent to the linux-kernel and stable lists, but
it was not merged and seems to have slipped through the cracks.
Indeed, the fate of this patch is instructive in its own right.  Even if
one is not concerned about any potential security implications of this
problem, it 
still seems like a bug worth fixing.  But it disappeared into the
linux-kernel noise, and the one maintainer who seems to have read it, Greg
Kroah-Hartman,
rejected it
as a
stable-kernel patch submission that did not follow
the
relevant rules
.  Nobody has bothered to direct it to a maintainer who
will actually apply it, so the problem remains unfixed.
Bug or vulnerability?
This isn't the first bounds-checking error to be exploitable via the
kernel command line. Matveychikov points out that this bug is similar to
CVE-2017-1000363
,
an overflow of the
parport_nr
array. On the oss-security list,
Simon McVittie
raised
the question of
whether there is a realistic way for an attacker to exploit the Linux
kernel boot command line without already having compromised the system.
McVittie asked: "
is this a security vulnerability, or
just a bug?
"
Daniel Micay
argued strongly
that this bug does not represent 
a security vulnerability, saying that "
it's unreasonable to consider
the kernel line untrusted
".  After all, as Micay
elaborated
, there is a
whole host of command-line knobs that allow users to alter
kernel functions. Florian Weimer disagreed, calling it a potential
secure boot bypass
, "
so it matters in some theoretical
sense to some downstreams which carry those Secure Boot patches.
"
Kurt Seifried
replied
that, for the
purposes of CVE assignment, this is a vulnerability. Micay
took issue
with the fact
that CVEs are assigned to bugs like this at all, calling it
"
meaningless Red Hat security theatre
".
Seifried
replied
that
CVE assignment has nothing to do with Red Hat, and that
Micay should take up the
issue with the MITRE/CVE Board.
Is this bug a potential secure-boot bypass? Yes, it is. "Secure boot"
isn't a monolithic piece of code that ends with UEFI, it also relies on
every privileged piece of code down the boot chain to ensure the integrity
of the running operating system. The UEFI portion verifies the bootloader
and kernel, and will happily hand off execution to any program that's
signed, even buggy kernels.  That program is supposed to keep control of
the system, preventing even a root user from performing actions that could
compromise the system; many actions that root can usually perform are often
disabled
when secure boot is in use.
Thus, secure-boot developers argue, kernel functionality and command-line
parameters need 
to be locked down so that the kernel cannot be modified in ways that will
subvert secure boot. For
example,
this
patch from David Howells
, which was merged for the 4.12 kernel,
provides annotations to mark
parameters that affect hardware, which in turn will let the kernel
lock some of those parameters
down
.  Buggy command-line processing that allows the overwriting of
unrelated memory clearly defeats this sort of lockdown; it can, thus, only
be seen as a vulnerability by anybody who is concerned about the use of
command-line (or module) parameters to defeat secure boot.
The kernel has certainly been getting more secure over the last few years,
with automated tools such as
fuzzers
and efforts like
the
Kernel
Self Protection Project
taking a more proactive approach to security.  
Bugs still slip in, of course, and sometimes it can take quite some time
before they 
are found and fixed as well.  When they are found, though, it is important
that those fixes do get merged; letting this one linger helps no one.

The -rc7 stage of the kernel development cycle is normally considered to be the wrong time to add new driver API functions; most developers attempting such a thing could expect to get a response that is less than 100% encouraging. But, if you're Linus, you can get away with such things. So, after looking at too much messy driver code, Linus [added a new helper function](/Articles/547563/) for drivers that need to map a physical memory range into a user-space process's memory: 
    
    
        int vm_iomap_memory(struct vm_area_struct *vma, phys_addr_t start, 
    			unsigned long len);
    

This function is a wrapper around `io_remap_pfn_range()` that takes care of a number of details specific to the virtual memory subsystem so that driver code need not worry about them. No drivers have been converted for 3.9, but one can expect that process to begin in the 3.10 cycle.

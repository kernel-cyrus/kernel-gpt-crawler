# 5.11 Merge window, part 1 [LWN.net]

By

December 18, 2020
When Linus Torvalds
released
the 5.10 kernel
, he noted that the 5.11 merge window would run up
against the holidays.  He indicated strongly that maintainers should send
him pull requests early as a result.  Maintainers appear to have listened;
over 10,000 non-merge changesets were pulled into the mainline in the first
three days of the 5.11 merge window.  Read on for a summary of the most
significant changes in that flood of patches.
Architecture-specific
Support for Intel's
software guard
     extensions
(SGX) finally made it into the kernel after 41
     revisions on the mailing lists.  Some information can be found in
this documentation
     commit
.
In the ongoing effort to crack down on user-space access to x86
     model-specific registers (MSRs), writes to
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS
are no longer allowed.  There is
a
     document
being constructed with a list of tools that perform
     writes to MSRs, with the eventual goal of finding better solutions for
     all of them.
The arm64 architecture can now expose tag bits on addresses (the
     uppermost bits that are not used as part of the virtual address) to
     signal handlers if the
SA_EXPOSE_TAGBITS
option has been set
     with
sigaction()
.
     This provides access to, among other things,
memory type extension
keys in pointers.
Support for Microblaze systems without a memory-management unit has
     been removed; it would seem that there are no longer any users of such
     systems.
The MIPS architecture has gained support for coverage testing with
     gcov.
Core kernel
There is a new
system-call interception
     mechanism
, based on
prctl()
,
     that allows user space to trap and emulate system 
     calls.  The target use case is running Windows games, but other
     applications seem likely as well.
The
userfaultfd()
system call now provides
the ability to disable handling of kernel-mode
     faults
as a security-enhancing measure.
The BPF subsystem has gained support for task-local storage — data
     that lives with a given task.  The first user is the BPF Linux
     security module (formerly
KRSI
).
The accounting of memory used by BPF programs has changed completely.
     There is now a control-group controller providing fine-grained
     management of memory use; see
this merge commit
for (some) information.
The BTF mechanism, providing information about kernel types for BPF
     programs (and more), has been extended to kernel modules.
The io_uring subsystem has gained support for the
shutdown()
,
renameat2()
,
     and
unlinkat()
system calls.
Calls to
io_uring_enter()
can now specify a timeout value.
     Adding this feature requires changing the API of that
     system call; 
     this was done by adding a new flag (
IORING_FEAT_EXT_ARG
) to
     indicate the presence of the timeout argument.
Filesystems and block I/O
The Btrfs filesystem has a couple of new mount options intended
     to help with the unwelcome task of rescuing data off a corrupted
     filesystem.  Using
rescue=ignorebadroots
will cause a mount
     to try to proceed with a corrupted extent root, while
rescue=ignoredatacsums
turns off data checksum verification.
Re-exporting a filesystem mounted over NFS is now considered to be a
     supported operation.
The
close_range()
system call has
gained a new
CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC
option
.  When that option is specified, the indicated file descriptors
     are marked close-on-exec rather than closed immediately.

     OpenCompute TimeCard clocks.

     Realtek RT715 SDCA codecs.
It's also worth noting that there has been more than the usual number
     of obsolete drivers removed during this merge window.  Quite a bit of
     cleanup has been happening across the driver subsystem.
Miscellaneous
Support for the
auxiliary bus
, a
     virtual bus for multi-function devices, has been added.
Networking
The 802.1Q "connectivity fault management" mechanism is
     now supported.  See
this merge
     message
for (a bit) more information.
Support for the WiMAX protocol has been moved to staging with the
     intent of removing it altogether in the near future.  It would appear
     that this support has not actually worked for some time, so the number
     of users is thought to be zero.
RFC 6951
— UDP
     encapsulation of the SCTP protocol — is now supported.
Zero-copy TCP receives have seen a number of performance improvements,
     making this feature worthwhile for much smaller payloads; see
this merge
     message
for more information.
There is a pair of new
ioctl()
calls to facilitate the
     bridging of PPP channels; see
this commit
for
     some documentation.
Security-related
The
seccomp()
system call has gained support for
constant-action bitmaps
.  This is a
     mechanism allowing
seccomp()
to determine that specific
     system calls are always allowed or denied and short out much of the
     processing work for those calls.
Internal kernel changes
The arm64 and  s390 architectures have
removed
set_fs()
.
The
migration disable
functionality
     has been merged.  The realtime tree has had this capability for years,
     but there is increasing need for it in the mainline as well.
One user of migration disable is the
kmap_local()
API
, which has also
     been merged.
By the normal schedule, the 5.11 merge window should close on
December 27, but Torvalds has indicated that he might delay the 5.11-rc1
release if he falls behind on pull requests due to the holidays.  The pace
of merging thus far suggests, though, that nobody should count on the merge
window lasting any longer than usual.  As always, we'll post another
summary once the merge window closes, whenever that may be.

I don't think 2.2 and 2.4 models are applicable any more. There are more of us, we're better (and older) than we used to be, we're better paid (and hence able to work more), our human processes are better and the tools are better. This all adds up to a qualitative shift in the rate and accuracy of development. We need to take this into account when thinking about processes.

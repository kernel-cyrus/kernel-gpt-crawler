# Statistics from the 3.9 development cycle [LWN.net]

As of this writing, Linus has stated that 3.9-rc7 should be the last
prepatch for the 3.9 development cycle.  If that prediction holds, the
final 3.9 release can be expected sometime around April 21, after a
62-day development cycle.  That is not the shortest cycle ever, but it is
getting close; in general, the community has been producing kernels more
quickly in the last year, with no kernel after 3.3 taking more than 71
days.  No kernel has gone past -rc8 since the release of
3.1-rc10
in October 2011 — and that was a
special case caused by the kernel.org breakin.  At this point, everybody
seems to know how the process works, and things go pretty smoothly.
3.8 was the most active development cycle ever.  At 11,746 non-merge
changesets (as of this writing), 3.9 will not beat that record, but it will
set one of its own: the 1,364 developers who contributed to this kernel are
the most ever.  The most active of those developers were:

H. Hartley Sweeten continues to work on the cleanup of the Comedi drivers,
but, for the first time since 3.5, he has been pushed out of the top
position by Takashi Iwai, who merged a vast amount of ALSA sound driver
work for 3.9.  Al Viro has been working on the cleanup of a number of
virtual filesystem APIs, but much of his work this time around was also
focused on making the signal code more generic and
architecture-independent.  Tejun Heo's work is divided between improving
the control group subsystem, improving workqueues, and
simplifying the IDR API
.  Johannes Berg is
highly active in wireless networking, and with the core mac80211 subsystem
in particular.
Paul Gortmaker got to the top of the "lines changed" column through the
removal of a number of old, obsolete network drivers; the kernel lost over
34,000 lines of code as the result of his work.  Laurent Pinchart did
a lot of low-level embedded architecture cleanup and improvement work, and
James Hogan added the new Meta architecture.
One could look at the development statistics and conclude that the average
kernel developer contributed eight or nine changesets during the 39 cycle.
The truth of the matter is a little different, as can be seen in this plot:
Just over one third of the developers working on 3.9 contributed a single
patch, and the median developer contributed two.  Meanwhile, the 100 most
active developers contributed more than half of all the patches merged in
this cycle.  This pattern where a relatively small group of developers is
responsible for the bulk of the changes has not changed much in recent years.
219 companies (that we know of) supported development of the 3.9 kernel.
The most active of these companies were:

For the first time ever, Intel finds itself at the top of the chart in both
columns, displacing Red Hat and even exceeding the total of contributions
from volunteers (those marked as "(None)" above); chances are, though, that
if all the developers in the 
"unknown" category were known, they would push the volunteer group back to
the top of the list.  In general, the percentage of contributions from
volunteers 
continues its slow decline.  In today's job market, it seems, anybody who
is able to get code into the kernel has to be fairly determined to reject
job offers to remain a volunteer.
In summary, the kernel development community remains healthy and vibrant,
delivering vast amounts of work to Linux users via a
process that appears to run like a well-oiled machine.  There are very few
projects, either free or proprietary, that can 
sustain this kind of pace for years at a time.  Given the kernel's history,
it seems likely that things will continue in this vein for some time; it is
going to be fun to watch.

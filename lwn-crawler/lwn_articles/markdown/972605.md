The 6.9 kernel was [released](/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whnKYL-WARzrZhVTZ8RP3WZc24C9_DT7JMJooONNT2udQ@mail.gmail.com/) on May 12 after a typical nine-week development cycle. Once again, this is a major release containing a lot of changes and new features. Our merge-window summaries ([part 1](/Articles/965141/), [part 2](/Articles/965541/)) covered those changes; now that the development cycle is complete, the time has come to look at where all that work came from — and to introduce a new and experimental LWN feature for readers interested in this kind of information. 

A total of 2,028 developers contributed to the 6.9 kernel; 285 of them made their first kernel contribution during this cycle. The most active contributors to 6.9 were:

Following what has become a longstanding tradition, Uwe Kleine-König was the biggest contributor of changesets this time around. This work, which is mostly focused on low-level device-driver refactoring, has brought about 2,500 changesets into the kernel since 6.3 was released in April, 2023. Kent Overstreet continued the work of completing and stabilizing the bcachefs filesystem. Christoph Hellwig kept on with his extensive refactoring work in the block layer and XFS filesystem. Krzysztof Kozlowski worked extensively with drivers and devicetrees for mobile systems, and Johannes Berg did a lot of work within the kernel's WiFi subsystem. 

In the "lines changed" column, Hamza Mahfooz and Hawking Zhang kept up another apparent tradition: adding huge files with lots of amdgpu register definitions. Matthew Sakai, instead, added the new [dm-vdo](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/vdo.html) device-mapper target. Matthew Wilcox removed the old NTFS filesystem implementation, and Ian Rogers added event definitions for Intel CPUs.

The top testers continue, by all appearances, to be people who do that work as a primary job focus. On the review side, there are 19 developers who reviewed at least one patch every day during this development cycle, and five of those reviewed more than two each day. 

There are 227 companies that were identified as having supported work on the 6.9 kernel, the highest number (by a small margin) since 6.4 was released. The most active employers were:

As usual, there are not a lot of surprises here; these results do not change greatly from one release to the next — or even from one year to the next. 

#### One last note

It has been over 17 years since [Who wrote 2.6.20?](/Articles/222773/) was published here. Back in 2007, it was still widely said that the kernel was mostly developed and maintained by volunteers; by taking the time to map commits in the kernel repository to employers, we showed that the reality was rather different, and that most kernel developers were paid for their work. 

After all these years, it sometimes seems that these articles contain about as much news as a tide table. The information found there might be useful, but it is not generally surprising. There is still interest in these articles, though, as we found out when we skipped a few development cycles some years back. Given the ongoing interest and the generally mechanical nature of putting this information together, it perhaps makes sense to delegate more of the work to a machine. 

Thus, we are happy to launch the [LWN Kernel Source Database](/ksdb/) as an experimental, subscriber-only feature. Much of the information found in these articles is available there, along with quite a bit more. We encourage readers to play with the system and to let us know what they think. To be clear: there is no plan to stop publishing these articles anytime soon, but now there is a resource for readers who would like to dig deeper.

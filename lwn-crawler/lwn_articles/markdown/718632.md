During the [4.6 development cycle](/Articles/687511), the operating performance points (OPP) framework gained the infrastructure to do [dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_voltage_scaling) on behalf of device drivers. This helps in reducing the complexity of those drivers, which can instead focus on platform-specific details. The rest of this article discusses what has changed and how can we use it to simplify our device drivers. 

Until Linux kernel release [4.5](/Articles/679931), the OPP framework was acting as a helper library that provided a table of voltage-frequency pairs (with some additional information) for the kernel. Kernel frameworks, like cpufreq and devfreq, used these OPP tables to perform DVFS for the devices. The OPP framework creates this table dynamically via platform-specific code and statically from [device-tree](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/usage-model.txt) blobs. 

#### Operating performance points

Systems on chips (SoCs) have become increasingly complex and power-efficient. There are multiple sub-modules within a SoC that work in conjunction, but not all of them are required to function at their highest performance frequency and voltage levels at all times, as that can be less power-efficient. Devices like CPUs, GPUs, and I/O devices have the capability of working at a range of frequency and voltage pairs. They should stay at lower voltages and frequencies when the system load is low and at higher levels otherwise. 

The set of discrete tuples consisting of frequency and voltage pairs that the device supports are called "operating performance points". For example, a CPU core that can operate at 1.0GHz at minimum voltage 1.0V, 1.1GHz at minimum voltage 1.1V, and 1.2GHz at minimum voltage 1.3V can be represented by these OPP tuples:
    
    
        Hz         uV
        1000000000 1000000
        1100000000 1100000
        1200000000 1300000
    

These tuples may contain more configurable values as well, for example voltage levels for multiple power supplies. The example at the end of this article shows how the OPP nodes are present in a device tree (DT) blob.

Before the 4.6 kernel, the OPP framework was responsible for creating an OPP table by parsing the device tree (or via the platform-specific code) and providing a set of helpers to inquire about the target OPPs. For example, finding the minimum or maximum OPP corresponding to the target frequency. The consumer drivers of the OPP library used the helpers to find an OPP corresponding to the target frequency and used it to configure the device's clock and power supplies (if required).

#### What's new

For the most common configurations (with at most one power supply for the device), all consumer drivers had pretty much identical DVFS code. So it made sense to let the OPP core configure the device to a particular OPP and simplify the drivers by removing such code from them. During the 4.6 development cycle, the OPP core thus gained the functionality to perform DVFS on behalf of device drivers. Those drivers need to pass a target frequency, and the OPP core will find and set the best possible OPP corresponding to that.

In order to perform DVFS on behalf of device drivers, the OPP core needs some of the device's resources. Some of them are acquired automatically by the OPP core, while the core needs help from the driver to get others. It is important for driver writers to understand the expectations of the OPP core before they try to use it to do DVFS for their devices.

In order to change the frequency of a device, the OPP core needs the pointer of the `struct clk` for the device. The OPP core gets this automatically by calling `clk_get()` using the device's `struct device` pointer. The driver must make sure that the device has a valid clock registered for it with the clock framework, otherwise the OPP core will fail to do DVFS for the device.

Voltage scaling isn't always required while doing frequency scaling, so acquiring the power-supply resources is optional. But for platforms that need to do voltage scaling, the OPP core needs some input from the driver. The OPP core supports devices that don't need a power supply, or that need single or multiple supplies. The driver needs to provide the names of all the power supplies to the OPP core that are required to be configured to perform DVFS for the device, using: 
    
    
        struct opp_table *dev_pm_opp_set_regulators(struct device *dev,
        						const char * const names[],
    						unsigned int count);
    

Here, `dev` is the pointer to the device structure, `names` is the pointer to an array of power-supply names and `count` is the number of entries in that array. This routine returns a pointer to the `struct opp_table` for the device on success and an error number (using `ERR_PTR()`) if something goes wrong. The order in which the names of the power supplies are present in this array is significant. The OPP core assumes that the entries in the `opp-microvolt` property in the OPP table in DT will be present in the same order as in the array. Refer to the example at the end for more on the `opp-microvolt` property. If this function isn't called for a device, the OPP core assumes that the device doesn't need to participate in voltage scaling and that frequency scaling can be done independently.

The OPP core in turn calls `regulator_get_optional()` for each string present in the `names` array. If the OPP core fails to get the regulator corresponding to any of the strings, it returns with an error. 

Once the consumer driver is done with the OPP table, it should free the resources acquired by the OPP core using the following routine:
    
    
        void dev_pm_opp_put_regulators(struct opp_table *opp_table);
    

Here, `opp_table` is the pointer to the OPP table, earlier returned by `dev_pm_opp_set_regulators()`.

#### Performing DVFS

Once the OPP core has all the resources it needs to do DVFS for a device, the consumer drivers can use the helpers described below to let the OPP core perform DVFS on its behalf. DVFS methods differ a bit depending on the number of power supplies required to be configured for the device. In the most common cases, the OPP core either needs to do only frequency scaling (no power supply) or needs to do voltage scaling for a single power supply along with it. For such platforms, the driver needs to call this helper to let the OPP core do DVFS for the device:
    
    
        int dev_pm_opp_set_rate(struct device *dev, unsigned long target_freq);
    

Where `dev` is the pointer to the device structure, and `target_freq` is the frequency we need to program the device for. This routine configures the device for the OPP with the lowest frequency greater than or equal to the target frequency. This routine returns zero on success and a negative error number otherwise.

If the device doesn't need to do voltage scaling at all, then `dev_pm_opp_set_rate()` can be called without calling `dev_pm_opp_set_regulators()` earlier. Otherwise, `dev_pm_opp_set_regulators()` must be called successfully before calling `dev_pm_opp_set_rate()`. If the target OPP has higher frequency than the current OPP, then `dev_pm_opp_set_rate()` does voltage scaling before doing frequency scaling. Otherwise frequency scaling is done before voltage scaling.

The handling is a bit different in the complex cases where voltage scaling of multiple power supplies is required. The order in which multiple power supplies need to be programmed is platform-specific and it is difficult to come up with common code that can work in all cases. To simplify things, the OPP core provides the capability to provide platform-specific `set_opp()` callbacks, which will be called by the OPP core from within `dev_pm_opp_set_rate()` at the time of DVFS. This callback can be registered using:
    
    
        struct opp_table *dev_pm_opp_register_set_opp_helper(struct device *dev, 
    			  int (*set_opp)(struct dev_pm_set_opp_data *data));
    

Here, `dev` is the pointer to the device structure, and `set_opp()` is the platform-specific callback. The callback takes `struct dev_pm_set_opp_data` as argument, which contains all the configuration the callback needs to do DVFS, and returns zero on success and negative error number otherwise. This helper returns a pointer to the `struct opp_table` for the device on success and an error number (cast as a pointer) if something went wrong.

The platform-specific callback should be unregistered using the following routine after the driver is done with the OPP table:
    
    
        void dev_pm_opp_register_put_opp_helper(struct opp_table *opp_table);
    

Here, `opp_table` is the pointer to the OPP table, earlier returned by `dev_pm_opp_register_set_opp_helper()`.

#### Connecting it all together

Here is an example that connects the dots to explain how it all fits together. We have two CPU devices here (that share their clock/voltage rails) and we need to configure a single power supply to perform DVFS for them. The device-tree fragment describing the CPUs themselves would be: 
    
    
    	cpus {
    		#address-cells = <1>;
    		#size-cells = <0>;
    
    		cpu@0 {
    			compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
    			reg = <0>;
    			next-level-cache = <&L2>;
    			clocks = <&clk_controller 0>;
    			clock-names = "cpu";
    			vdd-supply = <&vdd_supply0>;
    			operating-points-v2 = <&cpu_opp_table>;
    		};
    
    		cpu@1 {
    			compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
    			reg = <1>;
    			next-level-cache = <&L2>;
    			clocks = <&clk_controller 0>;
    			clock-names = "cpu";
    			vdd-supply = <&vdd_supply0>;
    			operating-points-v2 = <&cpu_opp_table>;
    		};
    	};
    

These definitions reference `cpu_opp_table`, which is a table describing the valid operating points for these CPUs; it is also found in the device tree: 
    
    
    	cpu_opp_table: opp_table {
    		compatible = "operating-points-v2";
    		opp-shared;
    
    		opp@1000000000 {
    			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <1000000000>;
    			opp-microvolt = <990000 1000000 1050000>;
    			opp-microamp = <70000>;
    			clock-latency-ns = <300000>;
    			opp-suspend;
    		};
    		opp@1100000000 {
    			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <1100000000>;
    			opp-microvolt = <1090000 1100000 1150000>;
    			opp-microamp = <80000>;
    			clock-latency-ns = <310000>;
    		};
    		opp@1200000000 {
    			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <1200000000>;
    			opp-microvolt = <1190000 1200000 1250000>;
    			opp-microamp = <90000>;
    			clock-latency-ns = <290000>;
    			turbo-mode;
    		};
    	};
    

The platform-specific code needed to set up DVFS would look something like: 
    
    
        const char *name[] = {"vdd"};
        struct opp_table *opp_table;
    
        opp_table = dev_pm_opp_set_regulators(dev, &name, ARRAY_SIZE(name));
        if (IS_ERR(opp_table))
    	dev_err(dev, "Failed to set regulators: %d\n", PTR_ERR(opp_table));
    

The driver responsible for voltage and frequency scaling would then do something like this: 
    
    
        ret = dev_pm_opp_set_rate(dev, target_freq);
        if (ret)
    	dev_err(dev, "Failed to set rate: %d\n", ret);
    

With these enhancements in the OPP core, using the standard interfaces like clocks and regulators, the device drivers are simplified to a great extent. Going forward we should enhance the OPP core further to keep all future DVFS-related configurations in a single place.

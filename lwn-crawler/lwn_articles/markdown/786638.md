The release of the [5.1-rc6](/Articles/786401/) kernel prepatch on April 21 indicates that the 5.1 development cycle is getting close to its conclusion. So naturally the time has come to put together some statistics describing where the changes merged for 5.1 came from. It is, for the most part, a fairly typical development cycle. 

As of this writing, 12,749 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline repository for the 5.1 release. That is slightly more than seen in 5.0, but still a bit lower than the other kernels released in the last few years. There were nearly 545,000 lines of code added by those changesets and 289,000 lines removed, for a net growth of 256,000 lines; this is not one of those rare development cycles where the kernel gets smaller. That work was contributed by 1,707 developers, 245 of whom made their first contribution in the 5.1 cycle. 

The most active developers this time around were:

The top contributor of changesets in 5.1 was Gustavo A. R. Silva, who continues to make general cleanups (such as marking `switch` fall-through cases) throughout the kernel tree. Yue Haibing was also a contributor of widespread cleanup work. Christoph Hellwig has been reworking the DMA-mapping code, improving the XFS filesystem, and more. Chris Wilson contributed a lot of work to the i915 graphics driver and Colin Ian King fixed a number of typos and coding-style issues. 

Oded Gabbay reached the top of the "lines changed" column by adding the Habana AI processor driver. Jakub Kicinski reworked the BPF self tests, Eric Biggers added a lot of testing code to the crypto subsystem, and Greg Kroah-Hartman deleted the xgifb driver from the staging tree. 

The kernel development community relies heavily on its testers and reviewers. The testing and review picture for 5.1 looks like this:

There have been times when these statistics have shown some questionable behavior — large numbers of reviews from an author's coworkers that never saw a public list, for example. This time, about the only thing that jumps out is Rob Herring's activity: he reviewed a large number of device-tree bindings from many different developers, just as one might expect a device-tree maintainer to do. Overall, the community benefits hugely from the efforts of our many testers and reviewers. 

#### Companies

A total of 230 companies (that could be identified) supported work on 5.1 — a typical number. The most active employers this time around were:

One obvious newcomer here is Habana Labs, which contributed a driver for its AI coprocessor to the kernel; otherwise there are not a lot of surprises in this table. 

#### Paths

One of the interesting things that can be determined, with some effort, from the kernel's Git repository is the path each commit took into the mainline — which other Git trees did it go through first? The information is not perfect; in particular, fast-forward merges will cause the provenance of a commit to be lost. But such merges are relatively rare in the kernel community (which lacks the fear of merges seen in many other projects), so an interesting picture can be created. 

The entire picture is rather large to embed in an article; it can be seen on [this page](/Articles/786656/). The portion corresponding to the networking tree (the biggest single source of commits flowing into the mainline) is shown below: 

> ![\[Treeplot output\]](https://static.lwn.net/images/2019/treeplot-5.1-net.png)

If a link between two git trees uses signed tags, it is shown in black; otherwise it appears in red. As can be seen, a number of significant trees are still not using signed tags in pull requests to the mainline; these include networking and, ironically, the security and crypto trees. The rule applied by Linus Torvalds is to require signed tags on any pull request that is not hosted on kernel.org; the diagram shows that he is adhering to that. Many of the other maintainers feeding into the mainline, though, do not enforce the same rule, so commits that originate on sites like GitHub are still being pulled in without signatures. 

The overall picture shows that, while there are more subsystems using multiple levels of maintainers, an awful lot of code still goes directly to Torvalds. The system appears to work, though; Torvalds has shown few signs of stress in recent years. The same could be said of the development community in general. While some maintainers are clearly stressed, the system as a whole continues to function smoothly, producing kernels with thousands of changes on a predictable nine or ten-week schedule.
